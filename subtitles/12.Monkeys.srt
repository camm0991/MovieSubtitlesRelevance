1
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:28,762
Flight 784 for San Francisco
is now ready for boarding.

2
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:09,069
Passengers for flight 841
to Rome, come to gate seven.

3
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:24,539
Flight 784 to San Francisco
is now ready for boarding at...

4
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:30,077
Inmate number
87645: Cole, James.

5
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:34,283
27631: Johnson.

6
00:02:34,383 --> 00:02:37,203
84743: Innis.

7
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:44,959
Jose. Psst.

8
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:48,399
Jose, what's going on?
- Bad news, man.

9
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:52,352
Volunteers?
- Yeah. And they said your name.

10
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,244
Hey, maybe they'll give you
a pardon, man.

11
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:06,483
Yeah. That's why none
of the volunteers...

12
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,253
come back. They all get a pardon.

13
00:03:08,353 --> 00:03:11,155
Some come back, I heard.
- Yeah.

14
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:15,256
Please put me back.
Don't take me.

15
00:03:15,356 --> 00:03:17,678
Yeah, they got 'em up on the...

16
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:20,617
seventh floor. They
hide 'em up there.

17
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:23,731
They're all messed up in the head.
Brains don't work.

18
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:25,623
You don't know
they're all messed up.

19
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:26,569
Nobody's seen 'em.

20
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:27,785
And maybe they're not messed up.

21
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:29,074
That's a rumor.
Nobody knows that.

22
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:31,976
I don't believe that.

23
00:03:32,076 --> 00:03:34,710
Good luck, man.

24
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,049
Volunteer duty.
- I didn't volunteer.

25
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:41,783
You causing trouble again?

26
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:45,101
No, no trouble.

27
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:52,062
These are the instructions
for the first time probe.

28
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:56,096
Listen carefully.
They must be followed exactly.

29
00:03:56,196 --> 00:04:00,802
All openings of your garment
must be sealed completely.

30
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:05,338
If the integrity of the suit
is compromised in any way,

31
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,713
if the fabric is torn
or a zipper not closed,

32
00:04:09,813 --> 00:04:12,053
readmittance will be denied.

33
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,507
If there are any...

34
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:48,792
indications of
contamination by germs,

35
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:51,892
the subject will be denied
reentry to secure population.

36
00:08:51,992 --> 00:08:53,082
Please place...

37
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,867
blood sample in
receptacle provided.

38
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:59,669
There will be a socialization
class in room 700...

39
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:04,372
for citizens cited
for deviations 23-A and 96-A...

40
00:09:04,472 --> 00:09:05,758
per subchapter six...

41
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:07,845
of the Permanent
Emergency Code.

42
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:11,661
James Cole cleared
from quarantine.

43
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:16,353
Thank you. You two wait outside.

44
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:19,222
He's got a history, Doctor.
Violence.

45
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:21,592
Antisocial six.

46
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:25,226
Repeated violations of
the Permanent Emergency Code.

47
00:09:25,326 --> 00:09:28,930
Insolence. Defiance.
Disregard of authority.

48
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,132
Doing 25 to life.

49
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:33,469
I don't think he's gonna hurt us.

50
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:37,009
You aren't gonna hurt us,
are you, Mr. Cole?

51
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:39,826
No, sir.

52
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:54,904
Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole?

53
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:22,352
We appreciate your volunteering.
You're a very good observer.

54
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:23,452
Thank you.

55
00:10:23,552 --> 00:10:25,688
We have a very advanced program.

56
00:10:25,788 --> 00:10:27,434
Something very different.

57
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:29,925
Opportunity to reduce
your sentence.

58
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:32,194
And possibly play an
important role...

59
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:34,862
in returning the human race
to the surface of the Earth.

60
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:38,818
We want tough-minded people.
Strong mentally.

61
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,007
We've had some misfortunes
with... unstable types.

62
00:10:46,107 --> 00:10:50,279
For a man
in your position, an opportunity.

63
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:53,284
Not to volunteer
could be a real mistake.

64
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:56,098
Definitely a mistake.

65
00:10:59,975 --> 00:11:02,615
'Yet among the
myriad microwaves,

66
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:07,195
the infrared messages,
the gigabytes of ones and zeros,

67
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:10,134
we find words, byte-sized now,

68
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:12,569
tinier even than science,

69
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:15,472
lurking in some vague electricity.

70
00:11:15,572 --> 00:11:17,739
But if we but listen,

71
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,999
we hear the solitary voice
of that poet telling us...

72
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:27,215
yesterday this day's madness
did prepare...

73
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:32,319
tomorrow's silent
triumph of despair.

74
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:36,024
Drink, for you know not
whence you came, nor why.

75
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:39,804
Drink, for you know not
why you go, nor where.'

76
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:51,639
...wandering around
in nothing but his underpants...

77
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:55,146
and one of those plastic,
see-through lady's raincoats.

78
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:59,049
So, they get there, they ask the guy
real nice for some kind of I.D.

79
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:02,216
He gets agitated,
starts screaming about viruses.

80
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:04,520
Totally irrational,
totally disoriented.

81
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,393
Doesn't know where he is,
what day of the week it is.

82
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,493
Lemme see.

83
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:10,725
All they got was his name.
- Thanks.

84
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:13,132
Of course, they figured
he's stoned out of...

85
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,329
his mind. Some kind
of psychotic episode.

86
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:18,668
He's been tested for drugs?
- Negative for drugs.

87
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:22,572
But he took on five cops
like he was dusted to the eyeballs.

88
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:26,274
No drugs. You believe that?
- He's in restraints.

89
00:12:26,374 --> 00:12:29,100
Yeah. Weren't you
listenin'? I've got...

90
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,648
two police officers in the hospital.

91
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:33,937
The medic gave him
enough stellazine to...

92
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:36,120
kill a horse. Look at
him. Rarin' to go.

93
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,124
That would explain the bruises,
I guess. The struggle.

94
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:43,656
Yeah. You wanna go in there,
examine him, what?

95
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:45,995
Yes, please.

96
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:49,799
Is this all you have?
Ran it through your system?

97
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:55,104
No matchup. No license, no prints,
no warrants. Nothing.

98
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:58,840
I should probably go in with you.
- No, thank you.

99
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,109
That won't be necessary.
- All right.

100
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:04,825
He'll be right here...
just in case.

101
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,777
Mr. Cole, my name
is Kathryn Railly.

102
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:19,560
I'm a psychiatrist.

103
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,263
I work for the county.
I don't work for the police.

104
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:23,897
So my concern is
for your well-being.

105
00:13:23,997 --> 00:13:24,932
Do you understand that?

106
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:28,102
Need to go. Need to go.

107
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:31,773
I can't make the police let you go.

108
00:13:31,873 --> 00:13:35,010
But I do wanna help you, so I...

109
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,015
I need you to tell me exactly
what happened tonight.

110
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:41,615
Do you think
you can do that, James?

111
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:44,194
May I call you James?

112
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:50,289
James.
Nobody ever calls me that.

113
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:53,429
Have you been a
patient at County?

114
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:54,529
No.

115
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:58,665
Have I seen you someplace?
- Not possible.

116
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:00,666
I need to go. I need to... I'm...

117
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:02,904
supposed to be
gathering information.

118
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:06,364
What kind of information?
- Won't help you.

119
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:09,609
Won't help anyone.
Won't change anything.

120
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:15,052
James, do you know
why you're here?

121
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:18,654
'Cause I'm a good
observer. Got a tough mind.

122
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:19,754
I see.

123
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:23,593
You don't remember assaulting
a police officer?

124
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:27,795
Why am I chained?
Why are these chains on me?

125
00:14:27,895 --> 00:14:29,610
You've been in an
institution before,

126
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,233
haven't you?

127
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,502
Or hospital?
- No. Now I need to go. Need to go.

128
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:36,440
Have you been in prison, James?
- Underground.

129
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,141
Hiding?

130
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:42,410
I love this air.

131
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,513
Oh, it's such wonderful air.

132
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:49,706
What's wonderful
about the air, James?

133
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,806
Very fresh. No germs.

134
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:58,862
Why do you think there aren't
any germs in the air?

135
00:14:58,962 --> 00:15:01,563
This is October, right?
- April.

136
00:15:01,663 --> 00:15:05,583
What year is this?
- What year do you think it is?

137
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,470
1996.

138
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,571
That's the future, James. Do you
think you're living in the future?

139
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:13,544
1996 is the past.

140
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:17,678
No, 1996 is the future.

141
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:19,996
This is 1990.

142
00:15:24,973 --> 00:15:28,325
Shut up, ladies.
- Where're you taking me?

143
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:30,890
South of France, buddy.
Fancy hotel. You'll love it.

144
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,628
I can't go. I just need
to make a telephone call.

145
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:36,748
Yeah, yeah. Zip it,
daisy. You fooled...

146
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:39,568
the shrink, but you don't fool us.

147
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:45,058
Let's go, ace.

148
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:15,716
All right.
Come on, come on.

149
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:21,242
There you go.
Now, lemme see your head, Jimbo.

150
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:24,979
See if you got any creepy crawlers.
- I need to make a telephone call.

151
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,018
Got to take you over
to the doctor, Jimbo.

152
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:29,242
Can't make no calls
'til the doctor says.

153
00:16:29,342 --> 00:16:30,353
It's very important.

154
00:16:30,453 --> 00:16:36,158
What you gotta do, Jimbo,
is take it easy. Relax into things.

155
00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:39,360
And we'll all get along fine
if you just relax.

156
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,915
Wow. Whoo-oo.

157
00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:50,321
Let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

158
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:57,212
Hey, Goines.

159
00:16:57,312 --> 00:16:59,014
Yo, Goines.

160
00:16:59,114 --> 00:17:04,286
Yo, Jeffrey.
Goines.

161
00:17:04,386 --> 00:17:06,920
What?
- Look here.

162
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,283
This here's James.
Now, do me a favor.

163
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:11,159
Why don't you show him around?

164
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:12,174
Tell him the TV rules.

165
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:13,760
Show him the games
and stuff. Okay?

166
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,734
How much you gonna pay me?
How much? I'd be doin' your job.

167
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:18,604
Five thousand dollars,
my man. That enough?

168
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,704
Five thousand?

169
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:21,436
I'll wire a check
to your account as usual.

170
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:23,729
Five thousand dollars.
Five thousand dollars.

171
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:24,875
Five thousand dollars.

172
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:27,178
I'll give him the deluxe
mental hospital tour.

173
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:28,278
My man.

174
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:29,912
Kid around, makes 'em
feel good. We're pals.

175
00:17:30,012 --> 00:17:31,012
I love you.

176
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:34,471
You're the prisoners.
No, you're the guards.

177
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:35,683
Now you got it.

178
00:17:35,783 --> 00:17:39,420
Okay, it's all in good fun.
Here's some games here.

179
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,023
And there's...
Get out. Get out.

180
00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:47,093
He was in my chair.

181
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:50,899
Games. Games.
Here's some games.

182
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:53,303
Games that wanna get out.

183
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:56,071
See? More games.

184
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:59,740
Games. They vegetize you.
See? Aah.

185
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,343
If you play the games, you're
voluntarily taking a tranquilizer.

186
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:07,014
I guess they gave you
some chemical restraints. Drugs.

187
00:18:07,114 --> 00:18:10,420
What'd they give you? Thorazine?
Haldol? How much? How much?

188
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,167
Learn your drugs.

189
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:12,653
Know your dosages.
It's elementary.

190
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:16,357
I need to make a telephone call.
- A telephone call?

191
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:18,833
That's communication
with the outside...

192
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:20,764
world. Doctor's discretion. No.

193
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:23,431
If all of these nuts
could just make phone calls,

194
00:18:23,531 --> 00:18:26,336
it could spread insanity
oozing through telephone cables,

195
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:28,532
oozing to the ears
of all these poor,

196
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:30,206
sane people, infecting them.

197
00:18:30,306 --> 00:18:33,075
Wackos everywhere.
A plague of madness.

198
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:35,626
In fact, very few,
Jim... Jim, very few...

199
00:18:35,726 --> 00:18:37,880
of us here are actually mentally ill.

200
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,250
I'm not saying
you're not mentally ill.

201
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,200
For all I know, you're... crazy as a...

202
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,052
loon. But that's
not why you're here.

203
00:18:44,152 --> 00:18:47,890
That's not why you're here.
That's not why you're here.

204
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:51,002
You're here
because of the system.

205
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:54,013
There's the television.

206
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:56,163
It's all right there.
All right there.

207
00:18:56,263 --> 00:18:58,203
Look, listen, kneel, pray.

208
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,301
The commercials.

209
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:02,847
We're not productive
anymore. Don't...

210
00:19:02,947 --> 00:19:04,471
make things anymore.
It's all automated.

211
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:07,675
What are we for then?
We're consumers, Jim.

212
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:10,648
Okay, okay. Buy a lot of stuff,
you're a good citizen.

213
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:13,713
But if you don't buy a lot of stuff,
what are you then?

214
00:19:13,813 --> 00:19:16,417
What?
You're mentally ill.

215
00:19:16,517 --> 00:19:20,722
Fact, Jim. Fact. If you don't
buy things: toilet paper, new cars,

216
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:22,952
electrically-operated
sexual devices, stereo...

217
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:24,858
systems with
brain-implanted headphones,

218
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,751
screwdrivers with
miniature built-in...

219
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:28,833
radar devices,
voice-activated computers...

220
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,933
Take it easy, Jeffrey.

221
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,337
Be calm.

222
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:35,671
Right.

223
00:19:35,771 --> 00:19:38,710
That's right.
You're a very attractive woman.

224
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,441
Hah.

225
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,489
If you want to watch a particular...

226
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:44,814
television program,
like All My Children,

227
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:46,729
you can go to the charge
nurse and tell her...

228
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:48,685
the day, the time the
show you wanna see is on.

229
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:49,663
But you have to tell her...

230
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:51,020
before the show is
scheduled to be on.

231
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,765
There was this guy,
and he was always...

232
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:54,553
requesting shows that
had already played.

233
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:57,758
Yes. No.
You have to tell her before.

234
00:19:57,858 --> 00:19:59,699
He couldn't quite grasp
the idea that the...

235
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,597
charge nurse couldn't
make it be yesterday.

236
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:03,967
She couldn't turn back time.
Thank you, Einstein.

237
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:07,202
Now he, he was nuts.
He was a fruitcake, Jim.

238
00:20:07,302 --> 00:20:11,771
Okay, that's it, Jeffrey.
You're gonna get a shot.

239
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:16,612
I warned you.
- Right. Right, right, right.

240
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:18,745
I got a little carried away...

241
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:22,815
explaining the inner workings
of the institution to Jim.

242
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:25,688
Hmm? Hmm?

243
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:29,221
I don't really come
from outer space.

244
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:30,162
Oh. L.J. Washington.

245
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,993
He doesn't really come
from outer space.

246
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:35,641
Don't mock me, my friend.

247
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:39,835
Get outta my chair.

248
00:20:39,935 --> 00:20:43,037
It's a condition
of mental divergence.

249
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:46,572
I find myself on the planet Ogo.

250
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:49,411
Part of an intellectual elite...

251
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:55,015
preparing to subjugate
the barbarian hordes on Pluto.

252
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:57,484
But even though this is a totally...

253
00:20:57,584 --> 00:21:00,154
convincing reality
for me in every way,

254
00:21:00,254 --> 00:21:05,129
nevertheless, Ogo is actually
a construct of my psyche.

255
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:08,728
I am mentally divergent...

256
00:21:08,828 --> 00:21:12,866
in that I am escaping
certain unnamed realities...

257
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:15,468
that plague my life here.

258
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:19,754
When I stop going there,
I will be well.

259
00:21:21,162 --> 00:21:25,599
Are you also divergent, friend?

260
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:33,888
This is a place for crazy people.

261
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:37,260
I'm not crazy.

262
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,640
We don't use that term,
'crazy,' Mr. Cole.

263
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,363
You've got some real nuts here.

264
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:51,239
I know some things
that you don't know.

265
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:54,143
It's gonna be very difficult
for you to understand it.

266
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:56,478
Hey.
- Hey, hey.

267
00:21:56,578 --> 00:22:00,181
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

268
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:02,668
All right.

269
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,388
Look, have any of you heard...

270
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:12,424
of the Army
of the Twelve Monkeys?

271
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:14,662
They, they paint this.

272
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:17,466
They stencil this on the sides
of buildings everywhere.

273
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:20,370
Have you seen this?
- Mr. Cole?

274
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,934
Why don't you take
your time and try...

275
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:25,241
to explain this from the beginning?

276
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:27,711
Right, right.
It's 1990.

277
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:31,648
Okay, that makes sense.
They wouldn't've been active yet.

278
00:22:31,748 --> 00:22:35,829
Um...

279
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:48,698
Five billion people died
in 1996 and 1997.

280
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,243
Almost the entire population
of the world.

281
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:57,037
Only about one percent
of us survived.

282
00:22:57,137 --> 00:22:58,568
Are you going to save us?

283
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,107
How can I save you?
This already happened.

284
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:04,812
I can't save you.
Nobody can.

285
00:23:04,912 --> 00:23:07,424
I am simply trying to
gather information...

286
00:23:07,524 --> 00:23:09,618
to help the people in the present...

287
00:23:09,718 --> 00:23:11,554
trace the path of the virus.

288
00:23:11,654 --> 00:23:15,292
We're not in the
present now, Mr. Cole?

289
00:23:15,392 --> 00:23:16,392
No.

290
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:20,397
1990 is the past. This already
happened. That's what I'm trying...

291
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:23,333
Mr. Cole? Mr. Cole?

292
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:26,533
You believe 1996
is the present then, is that it?

293
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:30,580
No. 1996 is the past too.
Listen to me. What I...

294
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:37,613
What I... What I need to do
is make a telephone call.

295
00:23:37,713 --> 00:23:42,052
I can straighten this out
if I make a telephone call.

296
00:23:42,152 --> 00:23:43,150
Who would you call?

297
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,185
Who would straighten
everything out?

298
00:23:45,285 --> 00:23:47,560
The scientists.
They'll want to know...

299
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,756
that they sent me
to the wrong time.

300
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:54,895
I can leave a voice mail message
that they monitor from the present.

301
00:23:54,995 --> 00:23:59,735
Can I just make
one telephone call, please?

302
00:23:59,835 --> 00:24:01,835
Please?

303
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:08,794
What are you doin'
in the dog bowl?

304
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:09,613
Get outta there.

305
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:13,314
Who put those Doritos
in there anyway?

306
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:16,821
Yes? What?
Voice mail?

307
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:19,255
Look, I don't know...
Stop makin' that noise.

308
00:24:19,355 --> 00:24:21,590
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

309
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,793
Is this a joke?
I don't know any scientists.

310
00:24:25,893 --> 00:24:28,133
Duanne, get out...
James who?

311
00:24:30,751 --> 00:24:34,002
Wasn't who you expected?

312
00:24:34,102 --> 00:24:39,341
No. It was some lady.
She didn't know anything.

313
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:43,645
Well, maybe it was
the wrong number.

314
00:24:43,745 --> 00:24:48,484
No. That's why they chose me.
I remember things.

315
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:50,904
James, where did you grow up?

316
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:52,952
Dr. Railly.

317
00:24:53,052 --> 00:24:56,122
I have the strangest feeling
I've met you before.

318
00:24:56,222 --> 00:24:58,785
Wait. This is 1990.
I'm supposed to be...

319
00:24:58,885 --> 00:25:00,428
leaving messages in 1996.

320
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:03,197
It's not the right number yet.
That's the problem.

321
00:25:03,297 --> 00:25:06,981
We have a message for them.

322
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,220
No.

323
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:45,137
Won't work.
Can't open it.

324
00:25:45,237 --> 00:25:50,197
You think you can remove the grill,
but you can't. It's welded.

325
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:54,012
See? Told you.
All the doors are locked too.

326
00:25:54,112 --> 00:25:56,520
They're protecting the people
on the outside from us...

327
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,540
when the people on the outside
are as crazy as us.

328
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:24,412
Do you know what 'crazy' is?
Crazy is majority rules. Yeah.

329
00:26:24,512 --> 00:26:26,512
Take germs for example.

330
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,014
Germs?
- Uh-huh.

331
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:32,855
In the eighteenth century,
no such thing. Nada. Nothing.

332
00:26:32,955 --> 00:26:34,323
No one ever imagined
such a thing.

333
00:26:34,423 --> 00:26:35,291
No sane person anyway.

334
00:26:35,391 --> 00:26:39,506
Along comes this doctor.
Uh, uh...

335
00:26:40,514 --> 00:26:42,514
Semmelweis.

336
00:26:42,594 --> 00:26:44,594
Semmelweis.

337
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:46,669
Semmelweis comes along
and he's trying...

338
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:48,837
to convince people,
other doctors mainly,

339
00:26:48,937 --> 00:26:51,876
that there are these teeny, tiny,
invisible bad things called germs...

340
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:54,439
that get into your body
and make you sick.

341
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,144
He's trying to get doctors
to wash their hands.

342
00:26:57,244 --> 00:26:59,244
What is this guy?
Crazy?

343
00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:02,917
Teeny, tiny, invisible 'what do you
call 'em? Germs? Huh? What?'

344
00:27:03,017 --> 00:27:05,737
Now, cut to the twentieth century.

345
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,290
Last week as a matter of fact, right...

346
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,925
before I got dragged
into this hellhole.

347
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:13,620
I go in to order a burger
in this fast-food...

348
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,798
joint. The guy drops it on the floor.

349
00:27:15,898 --> 00:27:18,167
Jim, he picks it up,
wipes it off.

350
00:27:18,267 --> 00:27:20,367
He hands it to me
like it was all okay.

351
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:23,672
'What about the germs?' I say.
He says, 'I don't believe in germs.

352
00:27:23,772 --> 00:27:25,826
Germs are a plot they
made up so they...

353
00:27:25,926 --> 00:27:27,875
can sell you
disinfectants and soaps.'

354
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:32,058
Now, he's crazy, right? See?

355
00:27:35,102 --> 00:27:39,889
There's no right. There's no wrong.
There's only popular opinion.

356
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:42,522
You, you, you believe
in germs, right?

357
00:27:42,622 --> 00:27:45,462
I'm not crazy.

358
00:27:45,562 --> 00:27:50,711
Of course not. You wanna
escape, right? That's very sane.

359
00:27:52,286 --> 00:27:56,526
I can help you. You want me
to, don't ya? Get you out?

360
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:59,976
You know how to get outta here?

361
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:03,508
Yes, my son.

362
00:28:03,608 --> 00:28:04,608
Then why don't ya?

363
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:07,146
Why don't I try to escape?
That's what you were gonna ask.

364
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:10,986
Good question.
Very good question. Intelligent.

365
00:28:11,086 --> 00:28:13,642
Because I would be
crazy to escape.

366
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:15,256
I have sent out word.

367
00:28:15,356 --> 00:28:18,728
I am all taken care of.
- What does that mean?

368
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:21,794
I've managed to contact
certain underlings, evil spirits,

369
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:24,085
secretaries of
secretaries, and other...

370
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:26,601
assorted minions who
will contact my father.

371
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:29,640
And when my father finds out
I'm in this kind of place,

372
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,509
he'll have them transfer me
to one of those classy joints...

373
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:36,547
where they treat you properly,
like a person, a guest.

374
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:39,082
With sheets and towels
like a big hotel,

375
00:28:39,182 --> 00:28:44,661
with great drugs for all of us
nut-case, lunatic, maniac devils.

376
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,593
Sorry. Uh, sorry.

377
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:50,817
I got a little agitated.

378
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:52,725
The thought of escape
crossed my mind.

379
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:55,232
And suddenly...

380
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:58,567
Suddenly I felt like bending
the fucking bars back.

381
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,974
And ripping out the
goddamn window...

382
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,635
frames and eating
them. Yes, eating them.

383
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:06,008
And leaping, leaping, leaping.

384
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:08,945
Colonics for everyone.

385
00:29:09,045 --> 00:29:11,045
Ahh, all right.

386
00:29:11,143 --> 00:29:12,636
You dumb assholes,
I'm a mental patient.

387
00:29:12,736 --> 00:29:13,612
I'm supposed to act out.

388
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:15,280
Wait'll you morons
find out who I am.

389
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,817
My father's gonna be really upset.

390
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:19,587
And when my father gets upset,
the ground shakes.

391
00:29:19,687 --> 00:29:24,838
My father is God.
I worship my father.

392
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:30,767
These dramatic videotapes,

393
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:32,883
secretly obtained by animal rights...

394
00:29:32,983 --> 00:29:35,334
activists, have aroused
public indignation.

395
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:39,051
But many scientists
vehemently disagree.

396
00:29:43,831 --> 00:29:46,514
Torture experiments.

397
00:29:46,614 --> 00:29:50,331
We're all monkeys.
- They hurt you?

398
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,400
Not as bad as what
they're doing to the Easter Bunny.

399
00:29:58,946 --> 00:30:02,833
Look at them.
They're just askin' for it.

400
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:04,700
Animals inside the lab...

401
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,036
Maybe the human race
deserves to be wiped out.

402
00:30:08,136 --> 00:30:12,206
Wiping out the human race?

403
00:30:12,306 --> 00:30:15,409
It's a great idea.
It's great.

404
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,823
But more of a long-term
thing. First we...

405
00:30:17,923 --> 00:30:20,012
have to focus on more
immediate goals.

406
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:24,454
I didn't say a word
about you-know-what.

407
00:30:24,554 --> 00:30:29,134
What are you talking about?
- Your plan. Emancipation.

408
00:30:32,012 --> 00:30:35,364
What are you writing?
You a reporter?

409
00:30:35,464 --> 00:30:38,801
It's private.

410
00:30:38,901 --> 00:30:40,933
A lawsuit? You gonna sue 'em?
- It's private.

411
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:44,616
Yo, Jimbo.
Time for your meds.

412
00:30:46,293 --> 00:30:50,911
Take a chance. Live the moment.

413
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:54,384
Sunshine. Gorgeous beaches.

414
00:30:54,484 --> 00:30:57,320
The Florida Keys.

415
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,144
We'll return you...

416
00:30:58,244 --> 00:30:59,823
to the Marx Brothers
in Monkey Business.

417
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:04,824
Monkey business.

418
00:31:04,924 --> 00:31:06,924
Fetch.

419
00:31:11,352 --> 00:31:14,136
Get it?
Monkey. Monk key.

420
00:31:14,236 --> 00:31:16,437
Monk key.

421
00:31:16,537 --> 00:31:19,071
What?
- Shh.

422
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:19,755
If you see...

423
00:31:19,855 --> 00:31:21,611
a bearish future in
the decade ahead,

424
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:23,715
consider the changes
sweeping the world...

425
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,379
and the opportunities they offer.

426
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:29,015
'And the opportunities
they offer.' Ooh.

427
00:31:29,115 --> 00:31:31,853
They really dosed you. Jim.

428
00:31:31,953 --> 00:31:34,453
Major load.
Danger, Will Robinson, danger.

429
00:31:34,553 --> 00:31:37,961
You gotta get it together.
Focus, focus, focus.

430
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:41,093
Remember the plan.
I did my part.

431
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:43,864
What?
- Shh.

432
00:31:43,964 --> 00:31:46,369
Not 'what,' when.

433
00:31:46,469 --> 00:31:48,469
When?
- Yes. When.

434
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:51,171
Now. Now, Jim. Now.

435
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:53,874
Yes. Now.
Buy. Sell.

436
00:31:53,974 --> 00:31:57,212
Stocks. Bonds.
Purchase. Sell.

437
00:31:57,312 --> 00:32:00,150
Yes.
No more monkey business.

438
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,883
No... more...

439
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:05,653
monkey business.

440
00:32:05,753 --> 00:32:07,657
Yes, enhance your portfolio now.

441
00:32:07,757 --> 00:32:10,593
Five hundred dollars. I got
five hundred dollars. I'm insured.

442
00:32:10,693 --> 00:32:14,261
Yeah. Window of opportunity
is opening now.

443
00:32:14,361 --> 00:32:18,133
Now is the time for all good men
to seize the moment. The moment.

444
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:20,637
Now is the time for all good men
to seize the day.

445
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:21,737
Aha.

446
00:32:21,837 --> 00:32:23,769
Goddamn it, Jeffrey.
Quit playin' the fool.

447
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:26,107
MasterCard.
Visa.

448
00:32:26,207 --> 00:32:29,242
The key to happiness.

449
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:32,913
Jim, seize the moment.

450
00:32:33,013 --> 00:32:34,783
Jeffrey, come back here.

451
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:37,200
For God's sake.
- Jeffrey.

452
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:46,125
Go, Jim.

453
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:49,830
Ohh.

454
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:54,047
Get out. Out.
- Come here, Jeffrey.

455
00:33:05,232 --> 00:33:09,349
The future can be yours.
Last chance. Last chance.

456
00:33:09,449 --> 00:33:12,030
Last chance.
Last...

457
00:33:26,553 --> 00:33:29,804
Best place to go would be Florida.

458
00:33:29,904 --> 00:33:33,656
The Keys are lovely
this time of year.

459
00:33:34,962 --> 00:33:38,044
...it's the only way to travel.

460
00:33:38,144 --> 00:33:39,812
I was gonna bring along
the wife and kiddies,

461
00:33:39,912 --> 00:33:41,579
but the grocer couldn't
spare another barrel.

462
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,399
I was gonna bring my grandfather,
but there's no room for...

463
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,930
Two's not working today.

464
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,746
Use one.

465
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,264
Kathryn, this was in my box.

466
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:29,361
But I have a slight suspicion
it wasn't meant for me.

467
00:34:29,461 --> 00:34:33,381
'You are the most bootiful
woman I have ever seen.

468
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:37,037
You live in a bootiful world,
but you don't know it.

469
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:40,510
You have freedom, sunshine,
air you can breathe...'

470
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,176
James Cole, right?

471
00:34:43,276 --> 00:34:48,246
'I would do anything to stay her
but I must leave. Please help me.'

472
00:34:48,346 --> 00:34:50,951
Okay, okay, okay.
Poor man.

473
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:54,086
Hey, Kathryn?
James Cole is one of yours, right?

474
00:34:54,186 --> 00:34:56,823
He eloped.
Last seen, he was up on two.

475
00:34:56,923 --> 00:34:58,923
Shit.

476
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:07,099
We have to know exactly
what's there so we can fix it.

477
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:09,572
Doctor, we have a visitor.

478
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:13,239
Um, may I help you? Excuse me?

479
00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:16,145
May I help you?
Excuse me?

480
00:35:16,245 --> 00:35:19,779
Excuse me?

481
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:22,482
Jim? Jim?

482
00:35:22,582 --> 00:35:26,266
Hey, Jimbo.
What's up, man?

483
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:31,828
Hey, Jimbo.

484
00:35:31,928 --> 00:35:36,198
All right, it's okay.
Take it easy.

485
00:35:36,298 --> 00:35:38,865
It'll be all right.
- Take care. Take it easy.

486
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:42,372
Take it easy.
We'll work this out, okay?

487
00:35:42,472 --> 00:35:44,585
Send you back to your
room. A little...

488
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:46,742
milk and cookies,
you'll be all right.

489
00:35:46,842 --> 00:35:49,611
Just take it easy, okay?

490
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:54,133
Come on. Calm down.

491
00:35:59,573 --> 00:36:03,168
Take him down.
Take him the fuck down.

492
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:11,863
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.
Dr. Railly, help me please.

493
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:14,300
We're gonna give you
something to calm you, James.

494
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
No. No more drugs.

495
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,969
James, we have to do this.
You're very confused.

496
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:20,424
No drugs. Stop it.

497
00:36:30,404 --> 00:36:33,162
Kathryn, we've been
working together for...

498
00:36:33,262 --> 00:36:35,955
four years. I've never
seen you like this.

499
00:36:36,055 --> 00:36:40,194
So please stop being so defensive.
This isn't an inquisition.

500
00:36:40,294 --> 00:36:41,853
I didn't think I
was being defensive.

501
00:36:41,953 --> 00:36:43,599
I was trying to
explain exactly what...

502
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:46,569
He should've been in restraints.

503
00:36:46,669 --> 00:36:48,269
It was bad judgment on your part,

504
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:50,270
plain and simple.
Why not own up to it?

505
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,934
Okay, it was bad
judgment, but I have...

506
00:36:52,034 --> 00:36:53,276
the strangest feeling about him.

507
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,278
I've seen him someplace,
and I'm trying...

508
00:36:55,378 --> 00:36:56,909
Two policemen are in the hospital.

509
00:36:57,009 --> 00:37:00,282
Now we've got a security guard
with a skull fracture.

510
00:37:00,382 --> 00:37:03,685
I said it was bad judgment.
What else do you want me to say?

511
00:37:03,785 --> 00:37:06,284
You see that?
See what I mean?

512
00:37:06,384 --> 00:37:08,254
You're being defensive.
Isn't she being defensive?

513
00:37:08,354 --> 00:37:09,354
Dr. Fletcher?

514
00:37:09,454 --> 00:37:14,437
What?
- Ah, we have... another situation.

515
00:37:18,752 --> 00:37:21,307
He was fully restrained
and the door was locked?

516
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:22,768
Yes, sir. I did it myself.

517
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:26,506
And he was fully sedated?

518
00:37:26,606 --> 00:37:30,051
He was fully sedated.

519
00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:42,667
Then, are you trying
to tell me a fully...

520
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:45,126
sedated, fully restrained patient...

521
00:37:45,226 --> 00:37:48,862
somehow slipped out that vent,
replaced the grill behind him...

522
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:53,716
and is wriggling his way
through the ventilation system?

523
00:38:10,971 --> 00:38:13,322
Watch it.

524
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:17,138
You sure fucked up.

525
00:38:19,613 --> 00:38:24,175
Where are you?
- Ah, you can talk.

526
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:32,040
What'd you do, Bobby boy?

527
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,607
My name's not Bob.

528
00:38:35,707 --> 00:38:39,813
Not a prob, Bob.
Where'd they send you?

529
00:38:39,913 --> 00:38:42,752
Where are you?

530
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:45,688
Another cell.

531
00:38:45,788 --> 00:38:48,320
Maybe.

532
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,658
What do you mean 'maybe'?
What's that supposed to mean?

533
00:38:50,758 --> 00:38:53,461
Maybe means...

534
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:56,528
maybe I'm in the next cell.

535
00:38:56,628 --> 00:39:00,266
Another volunteer like you.

536
00:39:00,366 --> 00:39:03,705
Or maybe I'm in
the Central Office...

537
00:39:03,805 --> 00:39:07,210
spying on ya
for all those science bozos.

538
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,746
Or hey,

539
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:13,115
maybe I'm not even here.

540
00:39:13,215 --> 00:39:17,466
Maybe I'm just in your head.

541
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:23,289
No way to confirm anything.

542
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:27,392
Where'd they send ya?
- 1990.

543
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:32,998
'90. How was it?
Good drugs? Lots of pussy?

544
00:39:33,098 --> 00:39:36,770
Hey, Bob, you do the job?

545
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:40,142
You find out the big info?

546
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:42,910
Army of the Twelve Monkeys?

547
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:45,476
It was supposed to be 1996.

548
00:39:45,576 --> 00:39:49,514
Science ain't an exact science
with these clowns,

549
00:39:49,614 --> 00:39:52,252
but they're getting better.

550
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:56,788
You're lucky you didn't end up
in ancient Egypt.

551
00:39:56,888 --> 00:39:58,888
Shh. They're comin'.

552
00:40:00,714 --> 00:40:03,532
The Freedom for Animals
Association on Second Avenue...

553
00:40:03,632 --> 00:40:04,872
is the secret headquarters...

554
00:40:04,972 --> 00:40:06,435
of the Army of the
Twelve Monkeys.

555
00:40:06,535 --> 00:40:10,204
They are the ones
who are going to do it.

556
00:40:10,304 --> 00:40:13,264
I can't do any more.
I have to go now.

557
00:40:13,343 --> 00:40:16,261
Have a merry Christmas.

558
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:20,248
Well?
- What?

559
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:23,551
Did you or did you not
record that message?

560
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:27,889
It's a reconstruction
of a deteriorated recording.

561
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:29,839
Weak signal. We have to...

562
00:40:29,939 --> 00:40:32,592
put them together
one word at a time.

563
00:40:32,692 --> 00:40:34,659
We just finished rebuilding this.

564
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:38,432
Did you or did you not
make this call?

565
00:40:38,532 --> 00:40:41,547
I couldn't make any
call. You sent me...

566
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,970
to the wrong year. It was 1990.

567
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,639
1990?
- 1990?

568
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:48,027
You're certain of that?

569
00:40:48,127 --> 00:40:50,112
What'd you do with
your time, Cole?

570
00:40:50,212 --> 00:40:52,981
Did you waste it
on drugs? Women?

571
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:55,080
They forced me to take drugs.
- Forced you?

572
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,569
Why would someone
force you to take drugs?

573
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,228
I was in trouble.
I... got arrested.

574
00:41:05,328 --> 00:41:09,631
I... I did what you wanted.

575
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:12,365
I got a specimen, a spider.

576
00:41:12,465 --> 00:41:16,502
I didn't have anyplace
to put it, so I ate it.

577
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:20,342
But you sent me to the wrong year,
so it really doesn't matter.

578
00:41:20,442 --> 00:41:23,442
Did you see this
when you went back?

579
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:25,982
No, sir, I don't think so.

580
00:41:26,082 --> 00:41:30,616
What about these people?
Did you see any of these people?

581
00:41:30,716 --> 00:41:32,718
No. No.

582
00:41:32,818 --> 00:41:35,741
Oh, wait, wait.

583
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,961
Him? You saw that man?

584
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:43,696
Maybe in the... maybe in
the mental institution.

585
00:41:43,796 --> 00:41:47,670
You were
in a mental institution? Oh, God.

586
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:51,871
Cole, you were sent back to make
some very important observations.

587
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:53,876
You could've made a
real contribution.

588
00:41:53,976 --> 00:41:56,812
Helped us to reclaim the planet.

589
00:41:56,912 --> 00:41:59,282
As well as reducing your sentence.

590
00:41:59,382 --> 00:42:03,894
The question is, Cole,
do you want another chance?

591
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,078
Good.

592
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:32,860
Last connection going on.
- Stand clear.

593
00:42:39,005 --> 00:42:40,533
He was your choice.

594
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:43,325
Nothing we can do about that now.

595
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:19,528
No mistakes this time, Cole.

596
00:43:19,628 --> 00:43:22,796
Stay alert.
Keep your eyes open.

597
00:43:22,896 --> 00:43:24,535
Good thinking about the spider.

598
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,600
Try and do something
like that again.

599
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,536
Just relax now.
Don't fight it.

600
00:43:28,636 --> 00:43:31,737
We're sending you
to the third quarter of 1996.

601
00:43:31,837 --> 00:43:34,521
Right on the money.

602
00:44:10,096 --> 00:44:12,758
What? I don't understand.

603
00:44:13,867 --> 00:44:16,882
What? I don't understand.

604
00:44:16,982 --> 00:44:19,985
Where am I?

605
00:44:20,085 --> 00:44:24,190
I gotta find 'em.
I gotta find 'em.

606
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,459
Help. I don't know where I am.

607
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:29,898
You gotta help me find 'em.
- Jose?

608
00:44:29,998 --> 00:44:31,998
Jose.
- Cole.

609
00:44:32,035 --> 00:44:34,735
Cole, where are we?
Where are we?

610
00:44:34,835 --> 00:44:36,868
Jose.
- Help me, Cole.

611
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:39,049
Oh, God. Wait.

612
00:44:53,373 --> 00:44:59,160
'In a season of great pestilence,
there are omens and divinations.

613
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,495
And one of the four beasts
gave unto the seven angels...

614
00:45:01,595 --> 00:45:04,731
seven golden vials
full of the wrath of God,

615
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:09,334
who liveth forever and ever.'
Revelations.

616
00:45:09,434 --> 00:45:11,326
In the fourteenth century,
according to the...

617
00:45:11,426 --> 00:45:13,106
accounts of local
officials of that time,

618
00:45:13,206 --> 00:45:14,713
this man appeared suddenly in...

619
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:16,613
the village of Wyle
near Stonehenge...

620
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,713
in April of 1362.

621
00:45:18,776 --> 00:45:22,213
Using unfamiliar words
and speaking in a strange accent,

622
00:45:22,313 --> 00:45:23,989
the man made dire
prognostications...

623
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:25,019
about a pestilence...

624
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,959
which he said would
wipe out humanity...

625
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,959
in approximately 600 years.

626
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:32,878
Obviously, this
plague-doomsday scenario...

627
00:45:32,978 --> 00:45:34,329
is more compelling...

628
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:36,996
when reality supports it
with a virulent disease,

629
00:45:37,096 --> 00:45:39,833
whether it's the bubonic plague,
smallpox or AIDS.

630
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:41,788
Now we have
technological horrors,

631
00:45:41,888 --> 00:45:43,238
such as chemical warfare,

632
00:45:43,338 --> 00:45:45,371
which reared its ugly
head during the...

633
00:45:45,471 --> 00:45:47,609
deadly mustard gas
attacks of World War I.

634
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:49,160
During such an attack in...

635
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,378
the French trenches
in October of 1917,

636
00:45:51,478 --> 00:45:53,391
we have an account of
this soldier, who,

637
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:55,649
during an assault, was
wounded by shrapnel...

638
00:45:55,749 --> 00:45:58,952
and hospitalized,
apparently in a state of hysteria.

639
00:45:59,052 --> 00:46:01,991
Doctors found that he had lost
all comprehension of French,

640
00:46:02,091 --> 00:46:04,359
but that he spoke English fluently,

641
00:46:04,459 --> 00:46:07,661
albeit in a regional dialect
they didn't recognize.

642
00:46:07,761 --> 00:46:11,330
The man, though physically
unaffected by the gas,

643
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,735
was beside himself.

644
00:46:13,835 --> 00:46:16,570
He claimed that he had come
from the future...

645
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,703
that he was looking
for a pure germ...

646
00:46:18,803 --> 00:46:20,462
that would ultimately
wipe mankind...

647
00:46:20,562 --> 00:46:21,806
off the face of the Earth...

648
00:46:21,906 --> 00:46:26,715
starting in the year 1996.

649
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:30,917
Though injured, the young soldier
disappeared from the hospital,

650
00:46:31,017 --> 00:46:33,389
no doubt trying to carry on
his mission to warn others,

651
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:35,953
and substituting
for the agony of war...

652
00:46:36,053 --> 00:46:40,429
a self-inflicted agony
we call the 'Cassandra Complex.'

653
00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:41,758
Cassandra, in Greek legend,

654
00:46:41,858 --> 00:46:43,466
was condemned to
know the future...

655
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:46,368
but to be disbelieved
when she foretold it.

656
00:46:46,468 --> 00:46:49,895
Hence, the agony of
foreknowledge combined...

657
00:46:49,995 --> 00:46:53,435
with the impotence to
do anything about it.

658
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,785
I'm going right out
to get vaccinated.

659
00:47:06,885 --> 00:47:07,885
Hi.

660
00:47:07,985 --> 00:47:11,091
I think, Dr. Railly, you've
given the alarmists a bad name.

661
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:14,827
I have? - Mm-hmm. Surely there's
very real and convincing data...

662
00:47:14,927 --> 00:47:17,600
that the planet cannot survive
the excesses of the human race.

663
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,700
This is true.

664
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,936
Proliferation of atomic devices,
uncontrolled breeding habits,

665
00:47:23,036 --> 00:47:26,605
pollution of land, sea and air,
the rape of the environment.

666
00:47:26,705 --> 00:47:28,955
In this context, isn't it obvious that

667
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,547
Chicken Little represents
the sane vision,

668
00:47:31,647 --> 00:47:35,416
and that Homo sapiens' motto,
'Let's go shopping,'

669
00:47:35,516 --> 00:47:39,253
is the cry of the true lunatic?

670
00:47:39,353 --> 00:47:41,819
Kathryn, it's time.
- My name is Troy.

671
00:47:41,919 --> 00:47:46,879
Please, Dr. Railly. I wonder
if you're aware of my own studies.

672
00:47:52,919 --> 00:47:56,001
See you at work tomorrow.

673
00:47:56,101 --> 00:47:59,889
Give you a call tomorrow.

674
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:15,856
No. No. Get in the car.

675
00:48:15,956 --> 00:48:19,935
Get in the car.
I've got a gun. Get in the car.

676
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:26,499
All right, drive.

677
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:28,167
Take my purse. I've
got a lot of cash...

678
00:48:28,267 --> 00:48:29,471
and credit cards. Take my keys.

679
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:33,013
Start the car.

680
00:48:36,729 --> 00:48:39,664
No.

681
00:48:45,038 --> 00:48:48,474
Here, turn right.
Turn right here.

682
00:48:52,945 --> 00:48:55,195
Wh-Where are we going?

683
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,018
Philadelphia.

684
00:48:56,118 --> 00:48:58,031
That's more than a hundred miles.

685
00:48:58,131 --> 00:49:00,665
That's why I can't walk there.
- Just let me go.

686
00:49:00,765 --> 00:49:03,485
Just drive.
- You can take the car.

687
00:49:03,502 --> 00:49:06,841
I don't know how to drive.

688
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:08,863
I went underground
when I was eight...

689
00:49:08,963 --> 00:49:10,678
years old. I told you that before.

690
00:49:10,778 --> 00:49:13,682
At the next corner, turn right.

691
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:16,882
Cole. James Cole.

692
00:49:16,982 --> 00:49:20,687
You escaped from
a locked room six years ago.

693
00:49:20,787 --> 00:49:23,726
Six years for you.

694
00:49:23,826 --> 00:49:26,226
Turn around. Get goin'.
- Okay.

695
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:40,209
I can't believe that
this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.

696
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:43,212
Have you been following me?
- You said you would help me.

697
00:49:43,312 --> 00:49:46,480
I know this isn't what you meant,

698
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,748
but I don't have any money.

699
00:49:48,848 --> 00:49:49,918
I hurt my leg,

700
00:49:50,018 --> 00:49:52,978
and I've been sleeping
on the street.

701
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,589
I'm sure I smell bad.
Do you have any food in this car?

702
00:49:56,689 --> 00:50:00,124
You have been following me,
haven't you?

703
00:50:00,224 --> 00:50:02,530
No.

704
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:06,468
No, I saw this...

705
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:09,438
in a store window.

706
00:50:09,538 --> 00:50:12,441
I can read, remember?
- Uh-huh.

707
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:17,413
Yeah. Why do you want
to go to Philadelphia?

708
00:50:17,513 --> 00:50:20,470
I checked out the
Baltimore information.

709
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:21,648
It was nothing.

710
00:50:21,748 --> 00:50:26,622
It's in Philadelphia. That's where
they are, the ones who did it.

711
00:50:26,722 --> 00:50:29,659
The Twelve Monkeys.

712
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,560
Is that a radio?
- Yeah.

713
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,660
Can you... turn it on?

714
00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:41,101
This is a personal message to you.

715
00:50:41,201 --> 00:50:46,108
Are you at the end of your rope?
Are you dying to get away?

716
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:48,540
The Florida Keys
are waiting for you.

717
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,640
Ocean waves...

718
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,013
I've never seen the ocean.

719
00:50:52,113 --> 00:50:55,883
It's an advertisement, Mr. Cole.

720
00:50:55,983 --> 00:50:58,049
What is?

721
00:50:58,149 --> 00:51:01,287
It's an advertisement.
You do understand that?

722
00:51:01,387 --> 00:51:05,174
It's not really
a special message to you.

723
00:51:07,847 --> 00:51:09,847
Mr. Cole.

724
00:51:11,317 --> 00:51:14,837
You used to call me James.
- You prefer that?

725
00:51:15,922 --> 00:51:19,274
James, uh,
you don't really have a gun.

726
00:51:19,374 --> 00:51:23,054
Can you turn this up?
Can you make this louder?

727
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:47,683
Ah, I love the music
of the twentieth century.

728
00:51:49,288 --> 00:51:52,883
I love this air.
Love to breathe this air.

729
00:52:06,072 --> 00:52:08,687
WXBX news break.

730
00:52:08,787 --> 00:52:11,058
News as it happens.
Roger Pratt reporting.

731
00:52:11,158 --> 00:52:12,899
A story breaking with
us now is emergency...

732
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:14,495
crews are converging
on a cornfield...

733
00:52:14,595 --> 00:52:16,532
where playmates
of nine-year-old Ricky Neuman...

734
00:52:16,632 --> 00:52:19,366
say they saw him disappear
right before their eyes.

735
00:52:19,466 --> 00:52:22,000
Young Neuman apparently stepped
into an abandoned well shaft,

736
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,838
and is lodged somewhere
in the narrow 150-foot pipe.

737
00:52:24,938 --> 00:52:27,241
Possibly alive,
possibly seriously injured,

738
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:29,374
playmates claim
they heard him cry out faintly.

739
00:52:29,474 --> 00:52:32,848
Never cry wolf.
- What?

740
00:52:32,948 --> 00:52:36,413
My father said that to me.
He said, 'Never cry wolf.'

741
00:52:36,513 --> 00:52:38,310
'Cause then people
won't believe you...

742
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:39,686
if something really happens.

743
00:52:39,786 --> 00:52:44,322
If something really happens
like what, James?

744
00:52:44,422 --> 00:52:46,479
Something bad. Can
we have some more...

745
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:48,527
music? I don't wanna
hear this stuff.

746
00:52:48,627 --> 00:52:52,765
Can we hear more music?

747
00:52:52,865 --> 00:52:56,515
Oh, that's good.

748
00:53:17,476 --> 00:53:21,695
Hello, Dr. Railly? Yeah, this is
Wikke from Psyche Admitting.

749
00:53:21,795 --> 00:53:24,261
Do you remember James Cole?

750
00:53:24,361 --> 00:53:27,067
The paranoid who pulled
the Houdini back in '90?

751
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,167
Well, he's back and...

752
00:53:29,267 --> 00:53:31,181
Sorry about that.
He's looking for you.

753
00:53:31,281 --> 00:53:32,641
I thought you ought to know.

754
00:53:32,741 --> 00:53:36,043
All right, take care.
- It's like I told you.

755
00:53:36,143 --> 00:53:40,077
Me and my husband went ahead
and she never showed.

756
00:53:40,177 --> 00:53:42,337
That is totally unlike her.

757
00:53:42,381 --> 00:53:45,383
Do you know the make of her car?
- Um...

758
00:53:45,483 --> 00:53:48,963
Cherokee.
'94 Cherokee, silver.

759
00:53:51,243 --> 00:53:53,757
I have 'doed-it.'

760
00:53:53,857 --> 00:53:55,461
I have 'done doed-it'.
Ja.

761
00:53:55,561 --> 00:54:00,884
I, Professor Grossenfibber, have
invented the time tunnel. Oh, boy.

762
00:54:03,923 --> 00:54:08,383
Oh, excuse me, mister.

763
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:15,694
Excuse me, mister. Have a cigar.

764
00:54:22,575 --> 00:54:25,860
No.

765
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,575
Now my time machine
is ready for experiments.

766
00:54:34,553 --> 00:54:38,580
Ah, the woodpecker. Ja.
Yo-hoo, Woodpecker.

767
00:55:05,584 --> 00:55:09,020
You were in my dream just now.

768
00:55:10,289 --> 00:55:13,952
Your hair's different.
Different color.

769
00:55:15,728 --> 00:55:18,253
I'm sure it was you.

770
00:55:19,932 --> 00:55:22,833
What was the dream about?

771
00:55:24,603 --> 00:55:27,489
About an airport...

772
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:29,890
before everything happened.

773
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:33,524
It's the same dream I always have.

774
00:55:33,624 --> 00:55:36,565
When I was a kid.

775
00:55:36,665 --> 00:55:38,665
And I was in it?

776
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:41,164
What did I do?

777
00:55:41,264 --> 00:55:43,721
You were very upset.

778
00:55:46,525 --> 00:55:49,242
You're always very upset
in the dream.

779
00:55:49,342 --> 00:55:53,546
Just never knew it was you.
- It wasn't me before, James.

780
00:55:53,646 --> 00:55:59,319
It's become me now because of
what's happening.

781
00:55:59,419 --> 00:56:02,499
Could you please untie me?

782
00:56:05,878 --> 00:56:09,298
No, I think it was always you.

783
00:56:09,398 --> 00:56:12,064
Very strange.

784
00:56:12,164 --> 00:56:15,074
You're flushed, and
you were moaning.

785
00:56:15,174 --> 00:56:17,654
I think you're running a fever.

786
00:56:26,499 --> 00:56:28,592
What are you doing?

787
00:56:40,846 --> 00:56:44,119
In Fresno, California,
crews continue to...

788
00:56:44,219 --> 00:56:47,819
attempt to rescue
nine-year-old Ricky Neuman.

789
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:53,206
And closer to home,
in Baltimore, Kathryn Railly,

790
00:56:53,306 --> 00:56:55,145
prominent psychiatrist
and the author...

791
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,942
of a newly released
book on insanity,

792
00:56:57,042 --> 00:56:59,176
disappeared mysteriously
last night...

793
00:56:59,276 --> 00:57:01,180
after a lecture at the university.

794
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,061
Former mental
patient, James Cole,

795
00:57:03,161 --> 00:57:04,619
is wanted for questioning...

796
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:07,122
regarding Dr. Railly's
disappearance.

797
00:57:07,222 --> 00:57:09,354
Authorities warn that Cole
has a history of violence...

798
00:57:09,454 --> 00:57:14,254
and advise anyone spotting him
to notify authorities at once.

799
00:57:23,255 --> 00:57:25,640
Love this music.

800
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,373
We don't have this.
We don't have anything like this.

801
00:57:28,473 --> 00:57:32,212
What are all those?
- These?

802
00:57:32,312 --> 00:57:35,183
My notes. Clues.

803
00:57:35,283 --> 00:57:38,316
What kind of clues?
- It's about the secret army.

804
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:39,800
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

805
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,655
They're the ones that
spread the virus.

806
00:57:41,755 --> 00:57:42,722
That's why I'm here.

807
00:57:42,822 --> 00:57:44,755
I have to find them.
That's my mission.

808
00:57:44,855 --> 00:57:47,193
I just have to locate
them because they have...

809
00:57:47,293 --> 00:57:49,529
the virus in its pure
form before it mutates.

810
00:57:49,629 --> 00:57:52,596
When I locate them,
they'll send a scientist here.

811
00:57:52,696 --> 00:57:54,732
That scientist will study the virus.

812
00:57:54,832 --> 00:57:56,775
Then when he goes
back to the present,

813
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:58,870
he and the scientists
will make a cure.

814
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:01,005
...police officers
from three jurisdictions,

815
00:58:01,105 --> 00:58:04,541
including special
tactical unit personnel,

816
00:58:04,641 --> 00:58:06,661
have now been
mobilized to control...

817
00:58:06,761 --> 00:58:08,781
the growing thousands
of onlookers...

818
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:12,884
in Fresno, California...
- Does that disturb you?

819
00:58:12,984 --> 00:58:16,825
No. I thought it was about us.

820
00:58:16,925 --> 00:58:19,506
I thought maybe
they'd captured us...

821
00:58:19,606 --> 00:58:20,694
and arrested me.

822
00:58:20,794 --> 00:58:23,063
Just a joke.

823
00:58:23,163 --> 00:58:25,309
Hmm.

824
00:58:28,053 --> 00:58:31,569
I remember being very afraid
for that little boy.

825
00:58:31,669 --> 00:58:33,880
All alone, down that
well, not knowing...

826
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,639
if anybody's gonna get him out.

827
00:58:35,739 --> 00:58:39,148
The first time I was ever
really afraid when I was a kid.

828
00:58:39,248 --> 00:58:41,413
What do you mean,
when you were a kid?

829
00:58:41,513 --> 00:58:43,548
Never mind.

830
00:58:43,648 --> 00:58:47,568
Just a prank, a hoax.
That boy's hiding in a barn.

831
00:58:58,918 --> 00:59:01,837
'There are omens and divinations.

832
00:59:01,937 --> 00:59:05,571
One of the four beasts
gave unto the seven angels...

833
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:09,308
seven golden vials
full of the wrath of God,

834
00:59:09,408 --> 00:59:13,011
who liveth forever and ever.'

835
00:59:13,111 --> 00:59:15,194
You won't think I'm crazy...

836
00:59:15,294 --> 00:59:17,898
when people start
dying next month.

837
00:59:17,998 --> 00:59:21,678
First they'll think
it's just some weird fever.

838
00:59:24,343 --> 00:59:26,795
Then they'll find out.

839
00:59:26,895 --> 00:59:29,596
They'll catch on.

840
00:59:29,696 --> 00:59:31,431
Wait.

841
00:59:31,531 --> 00:59:34,731
Stop here. Stop the car.
Stop right here.

842
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:41,374
I was right.
They're here.

843
00:59:41,474 --> 00:59:45,110
You see? Twelve Monkeys.
Twelve Monkeys.

844
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:49,497
Do you believe me now?
Come on.

845
00:59:51,036 --> 00:59:53,286
Come on.

846
00:59:53,386 --> 00:59:55,520
They're here.
You see?

847
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:58,059
Twelve Monkeys.

848
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:00,168
Twelve Monkeys.
Come on.

849
01:00:02,614 --> 01:00:04,330
Twelve Monkeys.

850
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:06,998
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, here.

851
01:00:07,098 --> 01:00:09,403
Here. Do you see it?
Do you see?

852
01:00:09,503 --> 01:00:11,940
I see some red paint, some marks.

853
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,476
Marks? Marks? Do you think that...
- Oh, this is ridicu...

854
01:00:14,576 --> 01:00:16,641
Hey. Hey.
- What?

855
01:00:16,741 --> 01:00:22,213
Don't you do anything crazy...
or I'll hurt somebody.

856
01:00:22,313 --> 01:00:24,016
I am not gonna do
anything crazy, but...

857
01:00:24,116 --> 01:00:25,687
none of this is what you think it is.

858
01:00:25,787 --> 01:00:28,205
You can't hide from them, Bob.

859
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:32,936
I said,
you can't hide from them.

860
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,998
No, sir, ol' Bob.

861
01:00:37,098 --> 01:00:39,744
Don't even try.

862
01:00:42,788 --> 01:00:45,538
They hear everything.

863
01:00:45,638 --> 01:00:49,458
They got that tracking
device on ya.

864
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:54,912
They can find you anywhere,
anytime.

865
01:00:55,012 --> 01:00:57,683
It's in the tooth.

866
01:00:57,783 --> 01:01:00,250
Right, Bob?

867
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:04,708
But I fooled 'em, old buddy.

868
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,764
They don't have to spy on me.

869
01:01:09,864 --> 01:01:12,067
I'm doing what I'm
supposed to be doing.

870
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:15,036
You see?
Here it is again.

871
01:01:15,136 --> 01:01:18,338
Here, follow this paint trail.

872
01:01:18,438 --> 01:01:20,438
Here. It's here.
See?

873
01:01:20,504 --> 01:01:24,744
It's so awful. I...
- No, no, no. Come with me.

874
01:01:24,844 --> 01:01:27,724
Damn it.
- The paint trail goes here.

875
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:33,784
Let go. Let go of my arm.
James, we shouldn't be here.

876
01:01:33,884 --> 01:01:36,500
Goddamn it.

877
01:01:42,648 --> 01:01:45,845
Leave me alone.

878
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:51,802
Let's get outta here.
James, we shouldn't be here.

879
01:01:51,902 --> 01:01:54,950
Hey.

880
01:02:04,203 --> 01:02:06,852
Please, don't kill me.

881
01:02:06,952 --> 01:02:11,032
Don't kill me. Please.
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

882
01:02:16,782 --> 01:02:18,782
Stick around, bitch.

883
01:02:40,873 --> 01:02:43,501
Are you all right?

884
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:49,079
Is he alive?

885
01:02:50,415 --> 01:02:53,199
Come on.
We're runnin' out of time.

886
01:02:53,299 --> 01:02:57,172
You can't help him.
- Oh, Jesus. James, you killed him.

887
01:02:57,272 --> 01:03:00,074
All I see are dead people.
Come on.

888
01:03:00,174 --> 01:03:04,276
Come on.
- You never had a gun before.

889
01:03:04,376 --> 01:03:08,345
I have one now.
Come on. Come on.

890
01:03:08,445 --> 01:03:11,251
'...dragons in
their pleasant palaces.

891
01:03:11,351 --> 01:03:13,629
The seventh angel poured out...

892
01:03:13,729 --> 01:03:16,758
his vial into the air,
and there came...'

893
01:03:16,858 --> 01:03:19,390
You. You.

894
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,946
You're one of us.

895
01:03:37,329 --> 01:03:39,545
This is it.

896
01:03:39,645 --> 01:03:41,645
Come on.

897
01:03:53,812 --> 01:03:58,249
Um... can we help you?

898
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:05,113
It's just a tape.

899
01:04:08,126 --> 01:04:11,806
I'm looking for
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

900
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:17,085
We don't know anything about
any Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

901
01:04:17,185 --> 01:04:18,571
So you and your friend
just disappear.

902
01:04:18,671 --> 01:04:19,717
I just want some information.

903
01:04:19,817 --> 01:04:23,753
Didn't you hear me? I sa...
- Don't hurt her.

904
01:04:23,853 --> 01:04:25,897
Please, I'm a psychiatrist.

905
01:04:25,997 --> 01:04:28,893
J-Just do whatever
he tells you to do.

906
01:04:28,993 --> 01:04:31,799
He's disturbed.
He's dangerous.

907
01:04:31,899 --> 01:04:33,899
Please, just cooperate.

908
01:04:33,901 --> 01:04:35,735
What do you want, money?
We only got a few bucks.

909
01:04:35,835 --> 01:04:36,669
I told you what I want.

910
01:04:36,769 --> 01:04:38,769
Get down. Lock that door.
- James, don't...

911
01:04:38,869 --> 01:04:42,643
Lock it now.

912
01:04:42,743 --> 01:04:44,412
I told you fucking
Goines would get us...

913
01:04:44,512 --> 01:04:45,512
Shut up.

914
01:04:45,612 --> 01:04:47,612
Goines?

915
01:04:49,001 --> 01:04:52,185
Jeffrey Goines?

916
01:04:52,285 --> 01:04:54,508
Then Jeffrey becomes
this big star,

917
01:04:54,608 --> 01:04:57,091
and the media latch
onto him because...

918
01:04:57,191 --> 01:04:58,499
he's picketing his own father,

919
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:00,359
a famous Nobel
prize-winning virologist.

920
01:05:00,459 --> 01:05:04,799
You must've seen all that on TV.
- I don't watch TV.

921
01:05:04,899 --> 01:05:06,899
Is this him?

922
01:05:06,935 --> 01:05:09,432
Yeah, that's him. That's him.

923
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:12,820
What are you gonna do to us?

924
01:05:14,426 --> 01:05:17,610
Tell me more about Jeffrey.

925
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:20,047
Jeffrey started getting bored
with the shit we do.

926
01:05:20,147 --> 01:05:23,147
Picketing, leafleting,
letter-writing stuff.

927
01:05:23,247 --> 01:05:26,053
He said we were ineffectual,
liberal jerk-offs.

928
01:05:26,153 --> 01:05:30,823
He wanted to do guerrilla actions
in order to educate the public.

929
01:05:30,923 --> 01:05:31,923
Like this?

930
01:05:32,023 --> 01:05:34,025
Yeah. That's when he let 100
snakes loose in the Senate.

931
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:36,862
But we weren't
into that kind of stuff.

932
01:05:36,962 --> 01:05:39,359
It's counterproductive.
We told him.

933
01:05:39,459 --> 01:05:40,632
So he and 11 guys,

934
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:44,553
they split off and formed
this underground army.

935
01:05:46,191 --> 01:05:49,354
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
See?

936
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:54,048
They started planning
a 'Human Hunt.'

937
01:05:54,148 --> 01:05:56,584
They bought
stun guns, nets and bear traps.

938
01:05:56,684 --> 01:05:58,884
They were gonna go to Wall Street
and trap lawyers and bankers...

939
01:05:58,984 --> 01:06:01,653
They didn't do it, of course.
They didn't do any of it.

940
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:05,492
Like always, Mr. Big Shot
sold his friends out.

941
01:06:05,592 --> 01:06:07,793
What does that mean?

942
01:06:07,893 --> 01:06:09,184
He goes on TV and gives a news...

943
01:06:09,284 --> 01:06:10,697
conference. Tells
the whole world...

944
01:06:10,797 --> 01:06:12,796
he just realized his
daddy's experiments...

945
01:06:12,896 --> 01:06:14,038
are vital for humanity...

946
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:17,389
and that the use of animals
is absolutely necessary.

947
01:06:17,489 --> 01:06:19,583
And that from now on
he, Jeffrey Goines,

948
01:06:19,683 --> 01:06:21,991
is going to personally
supervise the labs...

949
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:26,411
to make sure the little animals
aren't going to suffer.

950
01:06:31,055 --> 01:06:33,080
What is this?

951
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:42,834
People like that aren't accessible,

952
01:06:42,934 --> 01:06:44,714
okay? You can't just
barge in on them.

953
01:06:44,814 --> 01:06:46,137
It's not how the world works.

954
01:06:46,237 --> 01:06:48,554
Be quiet and drive the car.
I know what I'm doing.

955
01:06:48,654 --> 01:06:51,457
No, you don't.
This car is stolen.

956
01:06:51,557 --> 01:06:55,490
And we are in big trouble.
Big trouble.

957
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:57,799
If you don't turn yourself
over, the police are...

958
01:06:57,899 --> 01:07:00,062
going to kill you. They're
going to shoot me too,

959
01:07:00,162 --> 01:07:01,903
'cause I'm going to be
the accessory to murder.

960
01:07:02,003 --> 01:07:02,867
You're all going to die.

961
01:07:02,967 --> 01:07:06,772
Nobody is going to die.

962
01:07:06,872 --> 01:07:10,243
You're not going to save the world.

963
01:07:10,343 --> 01:07:12,577
Okay? You're delusional.

964
01:07:12,677 --> 01:07:15,112
You've made all this up out of
bits and pieces in your head.

965
01:07:15,212 --> 01:07:16,212
No.

966
01:07:16,312 --> 01:07:19,916
Yes. Let me give you an example.

967
01:07:20,016 --> 01:07:22,873
You know Jeffrey
Goines. You were...

968
01:07:22,973 --> 01:07:25,613
both patients at County Hospital.

969
01:07:25,688 --> 01:07:27,824
Jeffrey Goines was a fruitcake.

970
01:07:27,924 --> 01:07:30,121
He told you then his father was a...

971
01:07:30,221 --> 01:07:32,731
famous scientist who
worked with viruses.

972
01:07:32,831 --> 01:07:33,931
You've incorporated that bit...

973
01:07:34,031 --> 01:07:35,465
of information to this
cockeyed fantasy.

974
01:07:35,565 --> 01:07:36,803
He didn't say his father was a...

975
01:07:36,903 --> 01:07:38,336
scientist. He said
his father was God.

976
01:07:38,436 --> 01:07:39,436
This is insane.

977
01:07:39,536 --> 01:07:41,437
...prominent
psychiatrist and author.

978
01:07:41,537 --> 01:07:43,867
Dr. Kathryn Railly,
has been abducted by...

979
01:07:43,967 --> 01:07:46,075
a dangerous mental
patient, James Cole.

980
01:07:46,175 --> 01:07:49,286
Cole was under Railly's
care six years...

981
01:07:49,386 --> 01:07:52,746
ago when he made a
dramatic escape from...

982
01:07:58,142 --> 01:08:02,428
What is the matter with your leg?
- I got shot.

983
01:08:02,528 --> 01:08:05,331
Shot. Who shot you?

984
01:08:05,431 --> 01:08:06,431
I don't know.

985
01:08:06,531 --> 01:08:09,411
It was some kind of
war. Never mind.

986
01:08:09,427 --> 01:08:11,771
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

987
01:08:11,871 --> 01:08:13,871
What are you doing?

988
01:08:15,726 --> 01:08:16,726
We don't need gas.

989
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,876
I thought you didn't
know how to drive.

990
01:08:18,976 --> 01:08:23,046
I said I was too young to drive.
I didn't say I was stupid.

991
01:08:23,146 --> 01:08:25,868
This can't go on. If
you have a bullet...

992
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:28,555
in your leg, I have
to take care of it.

993
01:08:28,655 --> 01:08:32,632
I'm a doctor.
I need some supplies.

994
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:55,946
Meanwhile, in Fresno, California,

995
01:08:56,046 --> 01:08:57,700
where mining engineers
continue their...

996
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,284
desperate attempt to sink a shaft...

997
01:08:59,384 --> 01:09:01,745
parallel to the one in
which nine-year-old

998
01:09:01,845 --> 01:09:03,689
Ricky Neuman is believed trapped.

999
01:09:03,789 --> 01:09:06,159
Authorities say there is
still a chance the boy might be...

1000
01:09:06,259 --> 01:09:08,892
You shouldn't put
your weight on it.

1001
01:09:08,992 --> 01:09:11,898
You need stitches and antibiotics.

1002
01:09:11,998 --> 01:09:14,878
Lucky for you it's near the surface.

1003
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:23,251
I love seeing the sun.

1004
01:09:25,896 --> 01:09:27,989
Ooh.
- Wait.

1005
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:32,062
Let me help you.

1006
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:39,874
You smell so good.

1007
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:43,639
You have to give yourself up.

1008
01:09:46,583 --> 01:09:50,019
Y-You know that, don't you?

1009
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:56,676
W-What are you doing? James?

1010
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:59,477
I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

1011
01:09:59,577 --> 01:10:03,365
James, stop it.
What are you doing?

1012
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:04,512
I'm sorry.

1013
01:10:04,612 --> 01:10:07,252
Let go of me.
- I have to do this.

1014
01:10:12,776 --> 01:10:14,776
They find him?
- Who?

1015
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:17,326
That kid. The one in the pipe.
- You believe that?

1016
01:10:17,426 --> 01:10:19,604
They're lowering a monkey
down there and a...

1017
01:10:19,704 --> 01:10:21,733
miniature infrared
camera strapped on him,

1018
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:24,636
and a roast beef sandwich
wrapped up in tin foil.

1019
01:10:24,736 --> 01:10:25,834
You're making it up.

1020
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:28,237
No, I shit you not.
Life is really weird.

1021
01:10:28,337 --> 01:10:31,294
A monkey
and a roast beef sandwich.

1022
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:43,690
W-W-Would that I
could enjoy this opulent dinner...

1023
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:48,358
and this most, uh, stimulatin'
and excitin' company...

1024
01:10:48,458 --> 01:10:52,365
for itself with no sense of purpose.

1025
01:10:52,465 --> 01:10:57,601
But, alas, I am burdened.

1026
01:10:57,701 --> 01:10:59,563
For with all this excess of public...

1027
01:10:59,663 --> 01:11:01,473
attention and
cacophony of praise...

1028
01:11:01,573 --> 01:11:05,878
there comes great responsibility.

1029
01:11:05,978 --> 01:11:10,350
I don't have to tell you all
that the dangers of science...

1030
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:13,049
are a timeworn threat.

1031
01:11:13,149 --> 01:11:15,388
From Prometheus stealin'
fire from the gods...

1032
01:11:15,488 --> 01:11:16,488
What friend?

1033
01:11:16,588 --> 01:11:17,588
I'm not expectin' anyone.

1034
01:11:17,688 --> 01:11:19,689
to the Cold War era of the
Dr. Strangelove terror.

1035
01:11:19,789 --> 01:11:24,427
But never before...
- This is ridiculous.

1036
01:11:24,527 --> 01:11:28,063
My father's giving
a major address.

1037
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:33,573
...to fear the power...
we have at hand.

1038
01:11:33,673 --> 01:11:36,671
Normally, if we caught
a guy sneakin' around...

1039
01:11:36,771 --> 01:11:39,444
like this with no I.D.,
we'd bust his ass.

1040
01:11:39,544 --> 01:11:41,544
Excuse my French.

1041
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,882
This one says he knows you.

1042
01:11:43,982 --> 01:11:47,584
Since you seem to have had
a few unusual associates,

1043
01:11:47,684 --> 01:11:52,644
we certainly would not want
to arrest one of your closest pals.

1044
01:12:07,224 --> 01:12:09,642
Never seen him before in my life.

1045
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:13,011
Feel free to torture this man,
or whatever it is you do.

1046
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:16,145
I'm going to listen to my father's
eloquent discourse on...

1047
01:12:16,245 --> 01:12:19,585
I'm here about some monkeys.

1048
01:12:19,685 --> 01:12:22,386
Monkeys?
- Monkeys. Yes.

1049
01:12:22,486 --> 01:12:25,407
Twelve of them.

1050
01:12:28,278 --> 01:12:30,278
Arnold.

1051
01:12:30,358 --> 01:12:32,895
You look like shit.
- You know this man?

1052
01:12:32,995 --> 01:12:36,735
I know this man.
Arnold... Pettibone. Mm-hmm.

1053
01:12:36,835 --> 01:12:40,037
Gee, Arnie. It's black tie.
I said drop by,

1054
01:12:40,137 --> 01:12:44,207
but it's Dad's big do...
V.I.P. s, senators, Secret Service.

1055
01:12:44,307 --> 01:12:47,775
You hungry, Arnie?

1056
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:49,828
Killer feast we're
putting on tonight.

1057
01:12:49,928 --> 01:12:51,880
Lots of dead lamb,
dead cow, dead pig.

1058
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:53,819
Shall we?

1059
01:12:53,919 --> 01:12:56,154
Hi. How are you?
Hello.

1060
01:12:56,254 --> 01:12:59,822
Very attractive.
'The Great Escape,' 1990.

1061
01:12:59,922 --> 01:13:03,026
Watch it. Huh?
County Hospital? Am I right?

1062
01:13:03,126 --> 01:13:05,191
I can't do anything
about what you're...

1063
01:13:05,291 --> 01:13:07,197
going to do. I can't
change anything.

1064
01:13:07,297 --> 01:13:09,852
I can't stop you. I just
want the information.

1065
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:11,204
We need to talk. C'mon.

1066
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:15,405
Hi, ladies. Nice to see you again.
Watch your step on the way down.

1067
01:13:15,505 --> 01:13:18,540
Who blabbed?
Bruhns? Weller?

1068
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,009
I just want access
to the pure virus.

1069
01:13:20,109 --> 01:13:21,109
Virus?

1070
01:13:21,209 --> 01:13:23,780
For the future. I need to know
where it is and exactly what it is.

1071
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,151
Ahh, I get it.
I see what you're up to.

1072
01:13:26,251 --> 01:13:28,486
It's your old plan, isn't it?
- What plan?

1073
01:13:28,586 --> 01:13:29,317
Your plan. Remember?

1074
01:13:29,417 --> 01:13:30,889
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1075
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:33,134
Yes, you do. We were
in the dayroom...

1076
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:34,455
watching television...

1077
01:13:34,555 --> 01:13:36,111
and you were upset
about the desecration...

1078
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:37,430
of the planet, which I understand.

1079
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:38,884
Then you said to me, 'Wouldn't it...

1080
01:13:38,984 --> 01:13:40,495
be great if there was
a germ or virus...

1081
01:13:40,595 --> 01:13:43,734
that would wipe out all of mankind
and leave the animals and trees?'

1082
01:13:43,834 --> 01:13:45,800
You're trying to confuse me.
- You were so funny.

1083
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,935
I told you my father was...

1084
01:13:47,035 --> 01:13:48,471
this famous virologist,
and you said,

1085
01:13:48,571 --> 01:13:50,441
'He could make a
germ, and we could...

1086
01:13:50,541 --> 01:13:52,310
steal it.' Coo-coo-ka-roo, you were.

1087
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:55,376
They mutate.
We live underground.

1088
01:13:55,476 --> 01:13:58,346
The world belongs to
the dogs and cats.

1089
01:13:58,446 --> 01:13:59,819
We live like worms.

1090
01:13:59,919 --> 01:14:02,159
I just need the information.

1091
01:14:02,253 --> 01:14:03,253
Take it easy.

1092
01:14:03,353 --> 01:14:05,923
You are a total nutcase.
Completely deranged.

1093
01:14:06,023 --> 01:14:10,559
Delusional, paranoid.
Your process is all fucked up.

1094
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:13,195
Your information tray
is jammed, man.

1095
01:14:13,295 --> 01:14:15,932
Do you know what it is,
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?

1096
01:14:16,032 --> 01:14:18,938
It's a collection of space-case
do-gooders saving rain forests.

1097
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:20,974
I have nothing to do
with those bozos.

1098
01:14:21,074 --> 01:14:22,975
I quit being the rich kid fall guy...

1099
01:14:23,075 --> 01:14:25,343
for a bunch of ineffective fanatics.

1100
01:14:25,443 --> 01:14:28,145
So much for your grand plot,
asshole.

1101
01:14:28,245 --> 01:14:30,581
Father's been warning
people about dangers of...

1102
01:14:30,681 --> 01:14:32,917
experimentation with
D.N.A. viruses for years.

1103
01:14:33,017 --> 01:14:34,817
You've processed that
information through...

1104
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:36,423
your addled, paranoid
infrastructure.

1105
01:14:36,523 --> 01:14:39,174
Lo and behold, a
nonprofit organization...

1106
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:41,990
becomes some sinister,
revolutionary cabal.

1107
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:44,193
This man is complete bat shit.

1108
01:14:44,293 --> 01:14:47,262
Ladies and gentlemen,
do you realize where he thinks...

1109
01:14:47,362 --> 01:14:49,784
he comes from?

1110
01:14:51,755 --> 01:14:54,640
Capt. Dan Miller, the man
in charge of the rescue operation,

1111
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,317
says he has consulted
with experts,

1112
01:14:57,417 --> 01:14:58,943
and they assure us...

1113
01:14:59,043 --> 01:15:01,241
If you ask me, the
monkey's gonna eat...

1114
01:15:01,341 --> 01:15:02,977
that goddamn sandwich himself.

1115
01:15:03,077 --> 01:15:05,485
Did a man just come running
through here?

1116
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:07,201
...saying his primary...

1117
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:09,888
responsibility was
to the missing boy.

1118
01:15:09,988 --> 01:15:12,335
Police say that the body
of a woman found...

1119
01:15:12,435 --> 01:15:14,456
strangled in the
Knutson State Park...

1120
01:15:14,556 --> 01:15:16,558
could be kidnapping victim...

1121
01:15:16,658 --> 01:15:19,080
Dr. Kathryn Railly.

1122
01:15:21,218 --> 01:15:24,300
Anybody see someone
come through here?

1123
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,000
...discovered less than
an hour ago by hikers.

1124
01:15:28,003 --> 01:15:29,685
But we have an
unconfirmed report...

1125
01:15:29,785 --> 01:15:30,505
that the victim,

1126
01:15:30,605 --> 01:15:32,934
a woman in her late
twenties or early...

1127
01:15:33,034 --> 01:15:34,947
thirties, was savagely mutilated.

1128
01:15:35,047 --> 01:15:38,282
Earlier in the day, police located
Railly's abandoned car.

1129
01:15:38,382 --> 01:15:40,882
It was found not far...

1130
01:15:40,982 --> 01:15:44,087
Any sign of him?

1131
01:15:44,187 --> 01:15:46,654
Nothing.

1132
01:15:46,754 --> 01:15:50,839
He can't just disappear.

1133
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:12,361
You bastard.

1134
01:16:14,838 --> 01:16:19,124
I could've died in there.
You son of a bitch.

1135
01:16:19,224 --> 01:16:21,324
What were you thinking of,

1136
01:16:21,424 --> 01:16:25,832
you twisted sack of shit?
- I'm sorry.

1137
01:16:25,932 --> 01:16:29,099
Sorry I locked you in the trunk.

1138
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:33,713
I'm sick of you.

1139
01:16:38,028 --> 01:16:41,043
What have you done?
Did you kill somebody?

1140
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:45,318
Yes. A million people.
Five billion people.

1141
01:16:45,418 --> 01:16:46,418
What?

1142
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:51,486
Jeffrey Goines said
it was my idea about the virus.

1143
01:16:51,586 --> 01:16:53,650
We were in the institution. It was...

1144
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:55,928
all... so fuzzy, and
the drugs and all.

1145
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,898
Do you think it was my idea?

1146
01:16:58,998 --> 01:17:02,030
Do you think maybe
I've wiped out the human race?

1147
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:05,071
Nobody is gonna wipe out
the human race.

1148
01:17:05,171 --> 01:17:08,136
Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.

1149
01:17:08,236 --> 01:17:11,543
You've created something
in your mind. A... Oh.

1150
01:17:11,643 --> 01:17:14,710
Mentally divergent?
- A... Whatever.

1151
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:17,683
A substitute reality...

1152
01:17:17,783 --> 01:17:21,485
because you don't want
to deal with anything.

1153
01:17:21,585 --> 01:17:25,458
I would love it if that was true.

1154
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:28,292
It can be dealt with,
but only if you want to.

1155
01:17:28,392 --> 01:17:32,529
I can help you.

1156
01:17:32,629 --> 01:17:35,515
They're after me. We
have to get outta here.

1157
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,699
Who is after you?

1158
01:17:36,799 --> 01:17:40,559
I think there were
some policemen at that party.

1159
01:17:40,604 --> 01:17:43,374
Party? You went to a par...

1160
01:17:43,474 --> 01:17:45,474
Never mind.

1161
01:17:45,478 --> 01:17:46,687
It's important you surrender...

1162
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,280
instead of their
catching you running.

1163
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:51,413
Wouldn't it be great if I was crazy?
The world would be okay.

1164
01:17:51,513 --> 01:17:51,962
Gimme the gun.

1165
01:17:52,062 --> 01:17:53,582
I wouldn't live underground.
I lost the gun.

1166
01:17:53,682 --> 01:17:55,818
I could live right here.

1167
01:17:55,918 --> 01:17:59,623
You got water, air, stars.

1168
01:17:59,723 --> 01:18:02,426
I'm gonna attract their attention...
- Debris.

1169
01:18:02,526 --> 01:18:05,465
so they know where we are.

1170
01:18:05,565 --> 01:18:08,096
Oh, I love this world.

1171
01:18:08,196 --> 01:18:09,486
They're gonna tell you
to put your hands...

1172
01:18:09,586 --> 01:18:10,502
on your head. Do what they say.

1173
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:12,735
I love the frogs, the spiders.

1174
01:18:12,835 --> 01:18:17,715
Remember, I'll be with you.
I'll help you. I won't let them...

1175
01:18:28,138 --> 01:18:29,992
Then I said something
about cooperating,

1176
01:18:30,092 --> 01:18:31,423
and he said he would do that.

1177
01:18:31,523 --> 01:18:35,158
So, I, um...
I got in the car.

1178
01:18:35,258 --> 01:18:39,531
Thanks. And when I...
I started honking the horn.

1179
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:43,767
Then when I got out, he was gone.
- I'll tell you somethin'.

1180
01:18:43,867 --> 01:18:45,869
You lucked out. For a
while, we thought...

1181
01:18:45,969 --> 01:18:47,970
you were a body found
downstate mutilated.

1182
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:51,830
He wouldn't do that.
- This the man he attacked?

1183
01:18:55,732 --> 01:18:57,948
I wanna be clear about this, okay?

1184
01:18:58,048 --> 01:19:00,453
This man and the other one
were severely beating us.

1185
01:19:00,553 --> 01:19:05,222
James Cole didn't start it.
In fact, he saved me.

1186
01:19:05,322 --> 01:19:08,025
Funny thing, Doctor.

1187
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:12,594
Maybe you can explain it to me,
you being a psychiatrist and all.

1188
01:19:12,694 --> 01:19:15,265
Why is it that kidnap
victims always try...

1189
01:19:15,365 --> 01:19:17,935
to tell us about the
guys that grabbed 'em?

1190
01:19:18,035 --> 01:19:20,915
And they try
to make us understand...

1191
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:24,106
how kind these bastards
really were.

1192
01:19:24,206 --> 01:19:28,526
It's a normal reaction
to a life-threatening situation.

1193
01:19:30,366 --> 01:19:32,847
He's sick. Okay?

1194
01:19:32,947 --> 01:19:35,152
He thinks he comes
from the future.

1195
01:19:35,252 --> 01:19:36,620
He's been living in...

1196
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,332
a meticulously
constructed fantasy world,

1197
01:19:38,432 --> 01:19:40,126
and that world is
starting to disintegrate.

1198
01:19:40,226 --> 01:19:43,611
He needs help.

1199
01:19:46,716 --> 01:19:48,716
Okay.

1200
01:19:48,768 --> 01:19:50,795
Exhausted but apparently...

1201
01:19:50,895 --> 01:19:53,538
unharmed by her
thirty-hour ordeal.

1202
01:19:53,638 --> 01:19:55,638
Dr. Railly returned
to Baltimore this...

1203
01:19:55,738 --> 01:19:57,841
morning without making
a public statement.

1204
01:19:57,941 --> 01:19:59,570
The author and psychiatrist...

1205
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,746
is currently in
seclusion at her home.

1206
01:20:01,846 --> 01:20:03,772
Meantime, police have
pieced together...

1207
01:20:03,872 --> 01:20:05,650
a scenario of the series of events...

1208
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:06,750
that began with...

1209
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:08,885
escaped mental
patient James Cole...

1210
01:20:08,985 --> 01:20:09,985
Sorry.

1211
01:20:10,085 --> 01:20:12,487
No, it's okay. I'm just... hyperalert.

1212
01:20:12,587 --> 01:20:14,757
I can't sleep.

1213
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:17,200
Did you take your
sedative? - I hate...

1214
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,827
those things. They mess
my head up. Uh-uh.

1215
01:20:19,927 --> 01:20:22,334
...where he went
on a rampage of violence.

1216
01:20:22,434 --> 01:20:23,292
With the kidnapping...

1217
01:20:23,392 --> 01:20:24,870
of the Baltimore
woman, James Cole...

1218
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:26,878
is now also wanted in
connection with...

1219
01:20:26,978 --> 01:20:28,740
the brutal slaying
of Rodney Wiggins,

1220
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,441
an ex-convict from Ardmore.

1221
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:33,609
His body was discovered
in an abandoned theater...

1222
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:35,567
not far from where Cole
left three animal...

1223
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:37,178
rights activists
bound and gagged...

1224
01:20:37,278 --> 01:20:39,916
in their Second
Avenue headquarters.

1225
01:20:40,016 --> 01:20:41,648
Do they really believe...

1226
01:20:41,748 --> 01:20:44,052
he's going to show
up here? Please.

1227
01:20:44,152 --> 01:20:45,873
And in Fresno, California,
the cornfield...

1228
01:20:45,973 --> 01:20:47,324
that was jammed with spectators...

1229
01:20:47,424 --> 01:20:49,592
He's dead, isn't he,
that little boy?

1230
01:20:49,692 --> 01:20:53,065
He's fine. It was just a prank
he and his friends pulled.

1231
01:20:53,165 --> 01:20:54,705
The dramatic attempt
to rescue Ricky

1232
01:20:54,805 --> 01:20:56,434
Neuman from an
abandoned mine shaft...

1233
01:20:56,534 --> 01:20:58,752
ended abruptly when
playmates confessed...

1234
01:20:58,852 --> 01:21:01,069
that Neuman's disappearance
was a prank...

1235
01:21:01,169 --> 01:21:06,289
and that, in fact, the missing child
was hiding in a nearby barn.

1236
01:21:27,417 --> 01:21:29,897
Congratulations, Cole.

1237
01:21:29,997 --> 01:21:32,270
Well done. Well done.
- Congratulations.

1238
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:35,139
During your interview,
while under the influence,

1239
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:37,941
you told us that you liked music.
- This isn't a prison.

1240
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:38,942
This is a hospital.

1241
01:21:39,042 --> 01:21:40,744
Until you recover your equilibrium.

1242
01:21:40,844 --> 01:21:43,412
You're still disoriented.
- It is a stressful thing.

1243
01:21:43,512 --> 01:21:44,512
Time travel.

1244
01:21:44,612 --> 01:21:46,182
You stood up very
well, considering.

1245
01:21:46,282 --> 01:21:47,686
You connected the
Army of the Twelve

1246
01:21:47,786 --> 01:21:49,554
Monkeys with a famous
virologist and his son.

1247
01:21:49,654 --> 01:21:50,585
Others will take over now.

1248
01:21:50,685 --> 01:21:51,956
We'll be back on
service in months.

1249
01:21:52,056 --> 01:21:53,297
We'll retake the planet.

1250
01:21:53,397 --> 01:21:55,928
This is it, James. What
you've been working for.

1251
01:21:56,028 --> 01:21:59,027
A full pardon.
- You'll be out of here in no time.

1252
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:01,379
Women will want to know you.

1253
01:22:01,479 --> 01:22:05,047
I don't want your women.
I want to get well.

1254
01:22:07,857 --> 01:22:10,655
And you will be well, James.

1255
01:22:11,828 --> 01:22:14,956
Soon.

1256
01:22:16,299 --> 01:22:20,219
You know, you people don't exist.
You're not real.

1257
01:22:20,285 --> 01:22:24,623
We can't travel back in time.
Whoop. Whoop. Uh-uh.

1258
01:22:24,723 --> 01:22:28,560
You're not here.
You can't trick me.

1259
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:32,081
You're in my... You're in my mind.

1260
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:36,968
I am insane.

1261
01:22:37,068 --> 01:22:39,521
And you are my insanity.

1262
01:22:49,666 --> 01:22:51,827
He not only used the word 'prank,'...

1263
01:22:51,927 --> 01:22:54,087
he said the boy was
hiding in a barn.

1264
01:22:54,187 --> 01:22:57,719
Kathryn, Kathryn.
He kidnapped you.

1265
01:22:57,819 --> 01:23:00,389
You saw him murder somebody,

1266
01:23:00,489 --> 01:23:05,229
and you knew there was a real
possibility he could kill you too.

1267
01:23:05,329 --> 01:23:07,699
You're under
tremendous emotional stress.

1268
01:23:07,799 --> 01:23:10,534
For God's sake, Owen,
listen to me.

1269
01:23:10,634 --> 01:23:13,269
He knew about the boy in Fresno,
and he says five billion people...

1270
01:23:13,369 --> 01:23:14,773
are gonna die.

1271
01:23:14,873 --> 01:23:17,074
No way he could
possibly know that.

1272
01:23:17,174 --> 01:23:18,909
Kathryn.

1273
01:23:19,009 --> 01:23:23,146
You're a rational person.
You're a trained psychiatrist.

1274
01:23:23,246 --> 01:23:26,247
You know the difference between
what's real and what's not.

1275
01:23:26,347 --> 01:23:29,254
What we say is the truth
is what everybody accepts. Right?

1276
01:23:29,354 --> 01:23:31,852
Psychiatry...
it's the latest religion.

1277
01:23:31,952 --> 01:23:36,912
We decide what's right and wrong.
We decide who's crazy or not.

1278
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:40,197
I'm in trouble here.

1279
01:23:40,297 --> 01:23:43,033
I'm losing my faith.

1280
01:23:43,133 --> 01:23:46,635
You sure fucked up, Bob.

1281
01:23:46,735 --> 01:23:49,359
But I can understand.
You don't want...

1282
01:23:49,459 --> 01:23:51,672
your mistakes pointed out to you.

1283
01:23:51,772 --> 01:23:54,978
I can relate to that, old Bob.

1284
01:23:55,078 --> 01:23:58,484
Hey, I know what you're thinkin'.

1285
01:23:58,584 --> 01:24:02,504
You're thinkin' I don't exist
except in your head.

1286
01:24:02,588 --> 01:24:04,889
I see that point of view.

1287
01:24:04,989 --> 01:24:09,501
But you could still talk
to me, couldn't ya?

1288
01:24:09,601 --> 01:24:10,795
I saw you...

1289
01:24:10,895 --> 01:24:14,632
in 1996, in the real world.

1290
01:24:14,732 --> 01:24:18,902
You pulled out your teeth.
- Why would I pull out my teeth?

1291
01:24:19,002 --> 01:24:20,527
That's a no-no.

1292
01:24:20,627 --> 01:24:23,937
And when did you
say you saw me?

1293
01:24:24,037 --> 01:24:26,844
In 1872?
- Leave me alone.

1294
01:24:26,944 --> 01:24:30,613
Yellin' won't get you
what you want.

1295
01:24:30,713 --> 01:24:34,636
You have to be smart
to get what you want.

1296
01:24:36,205 --> 01:24:38,219
And what do I want?

1297
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:41,125
You don't know what you want?

1298
01:24:41,225 --> 01:24:46,193
Sure you do, Bob.
You know what you want.

1299
01:24:46,293 --> 01:24:49,634
You tell me.
You tell me what I want.

1300
01:24:49,734 --> 01:24:54,168
To see the sky and the ocean.

1301
01:24:54,268 --> 01:24:56,771
To be topside.

1302
01:24:56,871 --> 01:24:59,244
Breathe the air.

1303
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:02,844
To be with... her.

1304
01:25:02,944 --> 01:25:08,551
Isn't that right?
Isn't that what you want?

1305
01:25:08,651 --> 01:25:10,651
Bob?

1306
01:25:25,054 --> 01:25:27,181
Hello.

1307
01:25:27,356 --> 01:25:30,039
Dr. Railly,
Jim Halperin, Philly P.D.

1308
01:25:30,139 --> 01:25:33,386
Sorry to call you so
early this mornin'.

1309
01:25:33,486 --> 01:25:35,566
You found him? Is he okay?

1310
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:38,017
No, no.
Au contraire, Doctor.

1311
01:25:38,117 --> 01:25:39,992
No sign of your good friend, the...

1312
01:25:40,092 --> 01:25:42,352
kidnapper. However,
the plot does thicken.

1313
01:25:42,452 --> 01:25:44,587
I've got a ballistics report
on my desk.

1314
01:25:44,687 --> 01:25:46,894
It says the bullet you
claim you removed...

1315
01:25:46,994 --> 01:25:49,359
from Mr. Cole's thigh
is, in fact, an antique.

1316
01:25:49,459 --> 01:25:51,539
And all indications are...

1317
01:25:51,626 --> 01:25:55,197
it was fired sometime prior
to the 1920s.

1318
01:25:55,297 --> 01:25:56,821
How 'bout I take
a spin down there?

1319
01:25:56,921 --> 01:25:57,501
This can't be.

1320
01:25:57,601 --> 01:25:59,505
Maybe you and I can grab
a bite to eat.

1321
01:25:59,605 --> 01:26:04,405
Maybe you could revise or amplify
your statement. Dr. Railly?

1322
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:32,986
No.

1323
01:26:37,293 --> 01:26:39,875
You can't trick us, you know.

1324
01:26:39,975 --> 01:26:43,382
It wouldn't work.
- No, sir.

1325
01:26:43,482 --> 01:26:47,651
You haven't become addicted,
have you, Cole,

1326
01:26:47,751 --> 01:26:49,751
to that dying world?

1327
01:26:49,755 --> 01:26:52,056
No, sir.

1328
01:26:52,156 --> 01:26:54,689
I just want to do my part
to get us back on top,

1329
01:26:54,789 --> 01:26:56,825
in charge of the planet.

1330
01:26:56,925 --> 01:27:00,394
And I have the experience.
I know the people involved.

1331
01:27:00,494 --> 01:27:03,498
He really is the most qualified.

1332
01:27:03,598 --> 01:27:05,633
But all that behavior.

1333
01:27:05,733 --> 01:27:08,303
You said we weren't real, Cole.

1334
01:27:08,403 --> 01:27:11,517
I don't think the
human mind is meant...

1335
01:27:11,617 --> 01:27:14,257
to exist in... t-two different...

1336
01:27:14,278 --> 01:27:17,779
uh, whatever you called it...
dimensions?

1337
01:27:17,879 --> 01:27:21,118
It's just too stressful.
You said that yourself.

1338
01:27:21,218 --> 01:27:23,655
It's very confusing. You don't know
what's real and what's not.

1339
01:27:23,755 --> 01:27:28,790
But you know what's real now.
- Yes, sir. I do.

1340
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:33,597
No, no. I don't know
anything about...

1341
01:27:33,697 --> 01:27:36,433
a monkey army, Doctor.

1342
01:27:36,533 --> 01:27:39,202
No, no.
Nothing whatsoever.

1343
01:27:39,302 --> 01:27:42,465
Good Lord, if my son
was ever involved...

1344
01:27:42,565 --> 01:27:44,565
in something like that...

1345
01:27:44,574 --> 01:27:47,912
Yeah? Well, I'm sorry.

1346
01:27:48,012 --> 01:27:51,917
I think it's
doubly inappropriate to discuss...

1347
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:56,186
security matters with you,
Doctor, uh, Railly.

1348
01:27:56,286 --> 01:27:59,889
But, uh, if it will ease your mind,

1349
01:27:59,989 --> 01:28:02,309
rest assured that neither my son...

1350
01:28:02,409 --> 01:28:04,796
nor any other
unauthorized person...

1351
01:28:04,896 --> 01:28:07,750
has access to
potentially dangerous...

1352
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,863
organisms in my laboratory.

1353
01:28:09,963 --> 01:28:11,913
Is that clear to you now?

1354
01:28:12,013 --> 01:28:14,813
Thank you so much
for your concern.

1355
01:28:18,661 --> 01:28:21,528
Women psychiatrists.

1356
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:27,384
I attended a lecture of hers once.

1357
01:28:27,484 --> 01:28:31,019
'Apocalyptic Visions.'

1358
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:34,324
Yes. She was suddenly struck...

1359
01:28:34,424 --> 01:28:38,369
by the most preposterous notion
about Jeffrey.

1360
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:43,368
Has she succumbed to her own...

1361
01:28:43,468 --> 01:28:47,286
'theoretical' Cassandra disease?

1362
01:28:49,558 --> 01:28:54,041
Maybe we ought to review
our security procedures.

1363
01:28:54,141 --> 01:28:57,550
Yeah. Perhaps upgrade 'em,
you know?

1364
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:59,931
Beef 'em up, hmm?

1365
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:07,089
Let's consider again
our current information.

1366
01:29:07,189 --> 01:29:09,192
If the symptoms were
first detected...

1367
01:29:09,292 --> 01:29:10,292
in Philadelphia...

1368
01:29:10,392 --> 01:29:14,152
on December 27, 1996,
that makes us know that...

1369
01:29:14,197 --> 01:29:17,732
It was released in Philadelphia,
probably on December 13, 1996.

1370
01:29:17,832 --> 01:29:21,802
And was seen sequentially
after that in...

1371
01:29:21,902 --> 01:29:23,741
San Francisco, New Orleans.

1372
01:29:23,841 --> 01:29:26,306
Rio de Janeiro, uh.

1373
01:29:26,406 --> 01:29:29,044
Rome, Kinshasa.

1374
01:29:29,144 --> 01:29:31,464
Karachi, Bangkok,
then Peking.

1375
01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:37,070
That was very well done, Cole.

1376
01:29:43,479 --> 01:29:45,479
Hello.

1377
01:29:45,531 --> 01:29:49,963
Is somebody in there? If you're
in there, I have to talk to you.

1378
01:29:50,063 --> 01:29:52,870
It's the kidnap woman.
- Hello?

1379
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:55,171
The one who was with the guy
who tied us up.

1380
01:29:55,271 --> 01:29:55,958
I have to talk.

1381
01:29:56,058 --> 01:29:57,974
Turn off the lights.
Turn off the light.

1382
01:29:58,074 --> 01:29:59,074
What's she doin'?

1383
01:29:59,174 --> 01:30:01,142
She's drawing attention
to us, that's what.

1384
01:30:01,242 --> 01:30:03,436
I don't know what
you're up to this time,

1385
01:30:03,536 --> 01:30:05,949
Goines, but you're gonna
get us in deep shit.

1386
01:30:06,049 --> 01:30:09,169
Walkies ready? Batteries charged?
- Mmm.

1387
01:30:09,251 --> 01:30:12,686
I saw you.
I saw somebody in there.

1388
01:30:12,786 --> 01:30:15,160
Come on.
Secret experiments.

1389
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:17,426
That's what they do.

1390
01:30:17,526 --> 01:30:20,899
Secret weird stuff.

1391
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:23,869
Not just on animals.
- I know you.

1392
01:30:23,969 --> 01:30:27,339
Do 'em on people too, down at...
- Have you seen James Cole?

1393
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:29,808
The man who...
- They're watching you.

1394
01:30:29,908 --> 01:30:31,844
Takin' pictures.
- The police.

1395
01:30:31,944 --> 01:30:34,008
I know. Look.

1396
01:30:34,108 --> 01:30:38,545
I have to contact James.

1397
01:30:38,645 --> 01:30:42,386
It's very, very important that he's
really careful when he reaches me.

1398
01:30:42,486 --> 01:30:46,223
Do you understand that? Good.
- Yeah. Yeah. Who's James?

1399
01:30:46,323 --> 01:30:47,427
He was with me.

1400
01:30:47,527 --> 01:30:50,324
He spoke to you...
several weeks ago.

1401
01:30:50,424 --> 01:30:53,439
He said that you were
from the future...

1402
01:30:53,539 --> 01:30:56,019
and that you were watching him.

1403
01:31:01,557 --> 01:31:03,475
Bolt cutters.
Bolt cutters.

1404
01:31:03,575 --> 01:31:06,877
Did you get bolt cutters?
- One dozen. They're in the van.

1405
01:31:06,977 --> 01:31:08,635
Got the plans for
the security system?

1406
01:31:08,735 --> 01:31:09,179
Right here.

1407
01:31:09,279 --> 01:31:11,880
Committed to memory.
- Hey. Hey.

1408
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:13,820
You know what she's
doin' out there?

1409
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:14,920
What's it say?

1410
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:17,034
I don't know. I can't see it.

1411
01:31:17,134 --> 01:31:21,710
Forget about my psychiatrist and
concentrate on the task at hand.

1412
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:23,824
Your psychiatrist?

1413
01:31:23,924 --> 01:31:28,429
Did you just say your psychiatrist?
- Ex-psychiatrist.

1414
01:31:28,529 --> 01:31:31,556
This woman was your
psychiatrist, and...

1415
01:31:31,656 --> 01:31:34,696
now she's spray-painting
our building?

1416
01:31:40,262 --> 01:31:42,355
What's it say?

1417
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:47,167
Kathryn.

1418
01:31:47,185 --> 01:31:49,185
James?

1419
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:52,940
James.

1420
01:31:53,809 --> 01:31:56,025
James.
- What? What?

1421
01:31:56,125 --> 01:31:58,278
There's a policeman over there.
Pretend you don't know me.

1422
01:31:58,378 --> 01:31:59,430
No. I want to turn myself in.

1423
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:02,496
Where is he? Where is he?
- James. Down.

1424
01:32:02,596 --> 01:32:03,596
Come on.

1425
01:32:03,696 --> 01:32:06,235
No, no. It's okay.
I'm not crazy anymore.

1426
01:32:06,335 --> 01:32:10,405
I mean, I am. I'm mentally
divergent. I know that now.

1427
01:32:10,505 --> 01:32:13,473
I want you to help me.
I want to get better.

1428
01:32:13,573 --> 01:32:15,573
James.

1429
01:32:17,366 --> 01:32:19,366
Let's get outta here.

1430
01:32:19,418 --> 01:32:21,418
He's goin'.
He's goin'.

1431
01:32:33,015 --> 01:32:36,775
I've seen that before.
- No, James, you haven't.

1432
01:32:39,188 --> 01:32:42,372
A guy in a Ford is chasing her
and some other guy I can't see.

1433
01:32:42,472 --> 01:32:45,743
No problem. It's probably
just another kidnapping...

1434
01:32:45,843 --> 01:32:48,010
featuring Jeffrey's shrink.

1435
01:32:48,110 --> 01:32:51,213
Pardon me.
Make that ex-shrink.

1436
01:32:51,313 --> 01:32:53,381
This is your leader?

1437
01:32:53,481 --> 01:32:55,481
A certifiable lunatic...

1438
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:57,710
who told his former
psychiatrist all his plans...

1439
01:32:57,810 --> 01:32:59,987
for God knows what whacko
irresponsible schemes?

1440
01:33:00,087 --> 01:33:02,156
God knows what she's written
on that wall.

1441
01:33:02,256 --> 01:33:05,197
Who cares what psychiatrists
write on walls?

1442
01:33:05,297 --> 01:33:06,527
You think I told her about...

1443
01:33:06,627 --> 01:33:08,166
the Army of the
Twelve Monkeys, huh?

1444
01:33:08,266 --> 01:33:11,203
Impossible. Do you know why?
Do you know why?

1445
01:33:11,303 --> 01:33:14,032
Because, you pathetically
ineffectual and...

1446
01:33:14,132 --> 01:33:16,608
pusillanimous pretend
friend to animals.

1447
01:33:16,708 --> 01:33:18,386
I'll tell you why.
Because when I had...

1448
01:33:18,486 --> 01:33:20,078
anything to do with
her six years ago,

1449
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:22,378
there was no such thing,
I hadn't thought of it yet.

1450
01:33:22,478 --> 01:33:25,726
Then how come she
knows what's goin' on?

1451
01:33:25,826 --> 01:33:27,826
Here's my theory on that.

1452
01:33:27,912 --> 01:33:30,454
When I was institutionalized,
my brain was studied...

1453
01:33:30,554 --> 01:33:32,656
inexhaustibly in the
guise of mental health.

1454
01:33:32,756 --> 01:33:37,076
I was interrogated, x-rayed.
I was examined thoroughly.

1455
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:40,482
They took everything about
me and put it into a...

1456
01:33:40,582 --> 01:33:42,963
computer where they
created a model of my mind.

1457
01:33:43,063 --> 01:33:45,336
Yes. Using that model,

1458
01:33:45,436 --> 01:33:47,748
they managed to generate
every thought I...

1459
01:33:47,848 --> 01:33:50,106
could possibly have in
the next ten years,

1460
01:33:50,206 --> 01:33:54,377
which they then filtered through
a probability matrix of some kind...

1461
01:33:54,477 --> 01:33:58,046
to determine everything
I was gonna do in that period.

1462
01:33:58,146 --> 01:34:00,832
So you see, she knew
I was gonna lead the

1463
01:34:00,932 --> 01:34:03,684
Army of the Twelve
Monkeys into history...

1464
01:34:03,784 --> 01:34:05,690
before it even occurred to me.

1465
01:34:05,790 --> 01:34:07,653
She knows everything
I'm ever gonna do...

1466
01:34:07,753 --> 01:34:08,823
before I know it myself.

1467
01:34:08,923 --> 01:34:10,923
How's that?

1468
01:34:12,681 --> 01:34:15,797
Kweskin, you finish here.
I'll meet you there.

1469
01:34:15,897 --> 01:34:17,693
And if you forget one
thing, I will have...

1470
01:34:17,793 --> 01:34:19,332
you shaved, sterilized
and destroyed.

1471
01:34:19,432 --> 01:34:21,432
Jeff?
- What?

1472
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:24,005
You're a great man.

1473
01:34:24,105 --> 01:34:26,584
Ahh, fuck the bozos.

1474
01:34:27,863 --> 01:34:31,547
He's seriously crazy.

1475
01:34:31,647 --> 01:34:33,658
You know that.

1476
01:34:35,284 --> 01:34:38,102
On the lookout for...

1477
01:34:38,202 --> 01:34:41,349
The name is Cole.

1478
01:35:02,577 --> 01:35:04,427
There. Over there.

1479
01:35:04,527 --> 01:35:06,980
Okay. Come on.

1480
01:35:18,025 --> 01:35:20,444
I need a room.
- Thirty-five bucks an hour.

1481
01:35:20,544 --> 01:35:21,544
An hour?

1482
01:35:21,644 --> 01:35:26,296
You want quarter hours?
Go someplace else.

1483
01:35:34,542 --> 01:35:37,225
Uh, here's...

1484
01:35:37,325 --> 01:35:40,205
twenty-five, six, seven for an hour.

1485
01:35:40,263 --> 01:35:45,515
Deal?
- Hey. Turn it off.

1486
01:35:46,954 --> 01:35:49,907
One hour, honey babe.
Number sixty-four.

1487
01:35:50,007 --> 01:35:52,944
Sixth floor.
Up the stairs, end of the hall.

1488
01:35:53,044 --> 01:35:55,541
Elevator's busted.

1489
01:35:55,641 --> 01:35:57,641
She's not honey babe.

1490
01:35:57,648 --> 01:36:01,282
She's a doctor.
My psychiatrist.

1491
01:36:01,382 --> 01:36:03,382
Understand?

1492
01:36:05,239 --> 01:36:08,174
Whatever gets it up for you, Jack.

1493
01:36:16,617 --> 01:36:19,469
Tommy, this is Charlie
over at the Globe.

1494
01:36:19,569 --> 01:36:22,771
You know if Wallace
has a new girl?

1495
01:36:22,871 --> 01:36:27,211
Sort of a rookie type?
A little weird? Does fantasy acts?

1496
01:36:27,311 --> 01:36:31,047
Okay, you were standing there
looking up at the moon.

1497
01:36:31,147 --> 01:36:35,227
You were splashing
through the water, and then what?

1498
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:38,085
I thought I was in prison again.

1499
01:36:38,185 --> 01:36:40,720
Just like that,
you were in prison?

1500
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:42,923
No, not really.

1501
01:36:43,023 --> 01:36:46,025
Like you said.
It was all in my mind.

1502
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:49,364
You disappeared.

1503
01:36:49,464 --> 01:36:52,898
One minute you were there,
the next minute you were gone.

1504
01:36:52,998 --> 01:36:55,338
Did you run through
the woods, or...

1505
01:36:55,438 --> 01:36:59,291
I don't know.
I don't remember.

1506
01:37:00,862 --> 01:37:01,991
The boy in the well.

1507
01:37:02,091 --> 01:37:04,282
How did you know that
was just a hoax?

1508
01:37:04,382 --> 01:37:08,786
It was?
I d-didn't know.

1509
01:37:08,886 --> 01:37:10,585
You said he was hiding
in the barn.

1510
01:37:10,685 --> 01:37:13,624
I think I maybe saw a TV show
about that when I was a kid,

1511
01:37:13,724 --> 01:37:15,221
where a boy...

1512
01:37:15,321 --> 01:37:17,289
It wasn't a TV show.
It was real.

1513
01:37:17,389 --> 01:37:20,528
M-Maybe this boy saw
the same TV show that I did,

1514
01:37:20,628 --> 01:37:23,095
and he c-copied it.

1515
01:37:23,195 --> 01:37:26,300
Look, you were right.
I, I am mentally ill.

1516
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,806
I imagined all these things,
these people.

1517
01:37:28,906 --> 01:37:31,640
Ooh.
- I know they're not real.

1518
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:34,144
I can trick them. I, I...

1519
01:37:34,244 --> 01:37:36,613
I can make them do what I want.
I worked on 'em a little bit.

1520
01:37:36,713 --> 01:37:38,914
I got back here to get better.
- Ah.

1521
01:37:39,014 --> 01:37:43,232
I can stay here.
- What does this mean to you?

1522
01:37:51,612 --> 01:37:56,798
I think I had a dream
like... about this.

1523
01:37:56,898 --> 01:37:58,826
You had a bullet from
World War I in...

1524
01:37:58,926 --> 01:38:00,804
your leg, James. How
did it get there?

1525
01:38:00,904 --> 01:38:03,037
I don't know. Look, you sa...
You said I had delusions.

1526
01:38:03,137 --> 01:38:07,243
That I created this world.
You said you could explain.

1527
01:38:07,343 --> 01:38:08,343
I can't.

1528
01:38:08,443 --> 01:38:11,247
I'm trying to, and...

1529
01:38:11,347 --> 01:38:13,332
I, I can't believe that everything...

1530
01:38:13,432 --> 01:38:15,252
we say or do has
already happened.

1531
01:38:15,352 --> 01:38:18,452
We can't change
what's gonna happen.

1532
01:38:18,552 --> 01:38:22,426
And if five billion people
are gonna die, it's...

1533
01:38:22,526 --> 01:38:26,708
I want the future to be unknown.

1534
01:38:28,182 --> 01:38:31,765
I want to become
a whole person again.

1535
01:38:31,865 --> 01:38:35,272
I want this to be the present.

1536
01:38:35,372 --> 01:38:38,776
I want to stay here...
this time...

1537
01:38:38,876 --> 01:38:40,876
with you.

1538
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:09,705
James,

1539
01:39:09,805 --> 01:39:14,577
do you remember six years ago
you had a phone number?

1540
01:39:14,677 --> 01:39:17,379
It was the wrong number then.
- A woman answered.

1541
01:39:17,479 --> 01:39:21,751
It was the wrong number in 1990.
It should be the right number now.

1542
01:39:21,851 --> 01:39:23,917
Do you remember it?

1543
01:39:24,017 --> 01:39:26,070
The number? Do you...

1544
01:39:30,244 --> 01:39:34,328
This is my territory, bitch.

1545
01:39:34,428 --> 01:39:37,359
Is this real, or is this
one of my delusions?

1546
01:39:37,459 --> 01:39:38,999
This is definitely real.

1547
01:39:39,099 --> 01:39:41,099
Uh, excuse me.

1548
01:39:41,138 --> 01:39:44,909
I, I think we've got a little
misunderstanding here.

1549
01:39:45,009 --> 01:39:46,009
Oh?

1550
01:39:46,109 --> 01:39:49,074
Yeah. We...
- Gee, really?

1551
01:39:49,174 --> 01:39:51,913
Now, you just sit tight.

1552
01:39:52,013 --> 01:39:55,453
You listen to me,
little Miss Understanding.

1553
01:39:55,485 --> 01:39:57,070
You think you can
go around me and...

1554
01:39:57,170 --> 01:39:58,754
peddle your ass in
this part of town?

1555
01:39:58,854 --> 01:40:01,078
You bet your life we
got what I would...

1556
01:40:01,178 --> 01:40:03,288
call a major fuckin'
misunderstanding.

1557
01:40:03,388 --> 01:40:05,845
Hey.

1558
01:40:06,681 --> 01:40:10,433
James, no. Don't.

1559
01:40:10,533 --> 01:40:13,911
Uh, put him in the closet.
Take his money first.

1560
01:40:14,011 --> 01:40:15,603
You want me to rob him?

1561
01:40:15,703 --> 01:40:18,738
We need cash, James.
- No, no.

1562
01:40:18,838 --> 01:40:22,212
Call the cops.
Call the cops.

1563
01:40:22,312 --> 01:40:25,046
What's goin' on?

1564
01:40:25,146 --> 01:40:27,483
I've got friends, man.

1565
01:40:27,583 --> 01:40:29,987
Don't fuckin' kill me.
- James. James.

1566
01:40:30,087 --> 01:40:32,489
No, James. No.

1567
01:40:32,589 --> 01:40:34,423
No, James.

1568
01:40:34,523 --> 01:40:36,257
No. Open the door.

1569
01:40:36,357 --> 01:40:39,060
What the fuck are you doin'?

1570
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:42,498
Please don't hurt him.
Open the door.

1571
01:40:42,598 --> 01:40:45,609
James, come on.

1572
01:40:51,926 --> 01:40:53,926
Just in case...

1573
01:40:53,978 --> 01:40:57,943
Just in case I'm not crazy.
This is how they find us.

1574
01:40:58,043 --> 01:41:00,985
By our teeth.

1575
01:41:01,085 --> 01:41:04,752
I don't want them
to find me... ever.

1576
01:41:04,852 --> 01:41:07,257
I don't want to go back.

1577
01:41:07,357 --> 01:41:10,877
...calling in a domestic incident.
- Get out.

1578
01:41:14,415 --> 01:41:18,112
Get back.
You'd better load.

1579
01:41:19,754 --> 01:41:24,623
Police. Throw your weapons out
and come on out.

1580
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:32,547
Hey. Is that the cops?

1581
01:41:32,647 --> 01:41:35,367
Hey, I'm the innocent victim here.

1582
01:41:35,416 --> 01:41:38,195
I was attacked by
a coked-up whore...

1583
01:41:38,295 --> 01:41:40,775
and a, a fuckin' crazy dentist.

1584
01:41:53,554 --> 01:41:55,554
Try to blend in.

1585
01:41:55,572 --> 01:41:58,923
Oh, Jesus.
Come on.

1586
01:42:00,461 --> 01:42:03,678
There's gotta be a phone
around here somewhere.

1587
01:42:03,778 --> 01:42:06,082
There.
O-Over there. Look.

1588
01:42:06,182 --> 01:42:09,019
I'm gonna try that number, okay?
- Okay.

1589
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:12,038
Let's hope it's nothing.
- Okay.

1590
01:42:37,364 --> 01:42:40,913
James. James.
It's okay.

1591
01:42:41,013 --> 01:42:43,887
We're insane. We're crazy.
It's a carpet cleaning company.

1592
01:42:43,987 --> 01:42:47,053
A carpet cleaning company?
- Yeah. No superiors.

1593
01:42:47,153 --> 01:42:49,655
No scientists.
No men from the future.

1594
01:42:49,755 --> 01:42:51,580
It's just a carpet
cleaning company.

1595
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:52,724
They have voice mail.

1596
01:42:52,824 --> 01:42:54,145
You leave a message telling...

1597
01:42:54,245 --> 01:42:55,794
where you want your
carpet cleaned.

1598
01:42:55,894 --> 01:42:58,499
You left them a message?
- Yeah. I couldn't resist.

1599
01:42:58,599 --> 01:43:01,131
Wait 'til they hear this
nutty woman telling...

1600
01:43:01,231 --> 01:43:03,873
them to watch for the Army
of the Twelve Monkeys.

1601
01:43:03,973 --> 01:43:07,811
I said, 'The Freedom for Animals
Association on Second Avenue...

1602
01:43:07,911 --> 01:43:09,677
...is the secret headquarters...

1603
01:43:09,777 --> 01:43:11,714
of the Army of the
Twelve Monkeys.'

1604
01:43:11,814 --> 01:43:14,313
They're the ones
who are gonna do it.

1605
01:43:14,413 --> 01:43:17,287
I can't do anything more now.
I have to go.

1606
01:43:17,387 --> 01:43:19,839
Have a merry Christmas.'

1607
01:43:24,445 --> 01:43:27,107
You couldn't have heard me.
I...

1608
01:43:31,418 --> 01:43:35,001
They got your message, Kathryn.

1609
01:43:35,101 --> 01:43:37,941
They played it for me.

1610
01:43:38,041 --> 01:43:43,076
It was a bad recording,
distorted.

1611
01:43:43,176 --> 01:43:46,098
I didn't recognize your voice.

1612
01:44:08,656 --> 01:44:13,409
For the perfect Christmas gift...
- Mmm, and this.

1613
01:44:13,509 --> 01:44:17,555
Is everything okay?
You want anything?

1614
01:44:20,801 --> 01:44:22,719
Shall I
put this on your account, ma'am?

1615
01:44:22,819 --> 01:44:26,420
No. That'll be cash.

1616
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:28,520
Uh...

1617
01:44:29,643 --> 01:44:33,238
Can you tell me what floor
the wigs are on?

1618
01:44:41,021 --> 01:44:45,442
You turned the thing
into a fucking computer.

1619
01:44:45,542 --> 01:44:47,708
And Fale believed it.
- You know Fale.

1620
01:44:47,808 --> 01:44:51,980
If you guys get nailed,
which I'm pretty sure you will.

1621
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:56,582
I've never seen you before
in my fuckin' life.

1622
01:44:56,682 --> 01:44:59,252
Aha.
- Yeah.

1623
01:44:59,352 --> 01:45:01,657
C'mon, c'mon.

1624
01:45:01,757 --> 01:45:04,142
Bring 'im through.
C'mon.

1625
01:45:05,846 --> 01:45:07,846
Okay, drive.

1626
01:45:12,619 --> 01:45:17,024
What's the harm in openin'
the bag? His eyes are taped, right?

1627
01:45:17,124 --> 01:45:19,124
Right?

1628
01:45:21,495 --> 01:45:23,495
Okay. Okay.

1629
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,200
Hello. Hello.

1630
01:45:29,636 --> 01:45:32,718
Wanna hear the monkey speak?
- Yeah.

1631
01:45:32,818 --> 01:45:36,625
Ahh. Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, I know that's you.

1632
01:45:36,725 --> 01:45:39,028
I recognize your voice.
- No, you don't.

1633
01:45:39,128 --> 01:45:42,728
I also know all about
your warped little plan.

1634
01:45:42,796 --> 01:45:47,232
That lady, your psychiatrist?
She told me. I didn't believe her.

1635
01:45:47,332 --> 01:45:50,673
It just seemed too crazy,
even for you.

1636
01:45:50,773 --> 01:45:53,267
But just in case, I
took steps to make...

1637
01:45:53,367 --> 01:45:55,612
sure you couldn't
go through with it.

1638
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:58,981
I don't have the code anymore,
Jeffrey.

1639
01:45:59,081 --> 01:46:01,214
I don't have access to the virus.

1640
01:46:01,314 --> 01:46:03,416
I took myself...

1641
01:46:03,516 --> 01:46:07,520
out of the loop.
- Too late. Too late.

1642
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:11,123
We've got plans for you, Dad.

1643
01:46:11,223 --> 01:46:14,183
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
Agh. Agh. Agh.

1644
01:46:17,584 --> 01:46:22,033
I never let myself believe it.
Now I know it's true.

1645
01:46:22,133 --> 01:46:24,007
Jeffrey?
- Hmm?

1646
01:46:24,107 --> 01:46:26,651
You're completely insane.

1647
01:46:30,831 --> 01:46:33,527
No, I'm not.

1648
01:46:36,904 --> 01:46:39,382
There's a cross section of one...

1649
01:46:39,482 --> 01:46:42,522
of the old trees
that's been cut down.

1650
01:46:49,650 --> 01:46:52,380
Here I was born.

1651
01:46:53,353 --> 01:46:56,104
And there I died.

1652
01:46:56,204 --> 01:46:59,008
It was only a moment for you.

1653
01:46:59,108 --> 01:47:01,857
Y-You took no notice.

1654
01:47:05,399 --> 01:47:08,183
I think I've seen this movie before.
- Shh.

1655
01:47:08,283 --> 01:47:12,087
When I was a kid, I saw it on TV.
- Don't talk.

1656
01:47:12,187 --> 01:47:15,058
I did see it before.
- Tall trees.

1657
01:47:15,158 --> 01:47:17,027
Have you been here before?

1658
01:47:17,127 --> 01:47:18,691
Yes.
- When?

1659
01:47:18,791 --> 01:47:23,700
I don't... recognize this.
- When were you born?

1660
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:25,800
Long ago.
- Where?

1661
01:47:25,802 --> 01:47:27,468
What's the matter?

1662
01:47:27,568 --> 01:47:29,804
Tell me. Madeleine, tell me.
- No.

1663
01:47:29,904 --> 01:47:33,107
It's just like
what's happening with us.

1664
01:47:33,207 --> 01:47:36,343
Like the past.

1665
01:47:36,443 --> 01:47:40,114
The movie never changes.
It can't change.

1666
01:47:40,214 --> 01:47:43,586
But every time you see it, it seems
different because you're different.

1667
01:47:43,686 --> 01:47:47,889
You see different things.
- Please don't ask me.

1668
01:47:47,989 --> 01:47:50,725
If you can't change anything
because it's already happened,

1669
01:47:50,825 --> 01:47:53,027
you may as well smell the flowers.

1670
01:47:53,127 --> 01:47:54,761
What flowers?

1671
01:47:54,861 --> 01:47:58,364
That's an expression.
- Shh.

1672
01:47:58,464 --> 01:48:02,218
Promise me
you won't ask me again. Please?

1673
01:48:03,891 --> 01:48:05,950
Kathryn,

1674
01:48:11,565 --> 01:48:14,125
why are you doing this?

1675
01:48:15,903 --> 01:48:17,903
I want to know why.

1676
01:48:17,921 --> 01:48:20,723
What if I'm wrong?
What if you're wrong?

1677
01:48:20,823 --> 01:48:22,888
What if I am crazy?

1678
01:48:22,988 --> 01:48:26,828
In a few weeks,
it will have started or it won't.

1679
01:48:26,828 --> 01:48:30,295
If there's still...

1680
01:48:30,395 --> 01:48:35,137
football games, traffic jams,
TV shows and armed robberies,

1681
01:48:35,237 --> 01:48:39,271
we're going to be so glad that we'll
be thrilled to see the police.

1682
01:48:39,371 --> 01:48:41,244
I'm responsible for you now.

1683
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:43,310
The Chinese say once you've
saved a person's life,

1684
01:48:43,410 --> 01:48:44,410
Shh.

1685
01:48:44,510 --> 01:48:47,015
you're responsible for it
forever, so I'm committed.

1686
01:48:47,115 --> 01:48:48,115
Do you have a plan?

1687
01:48:48,215 --> 01:48:50,249
I have to know.

1688
01:48:50,349 --> 01:48:54,285
There's so little that I know.

1689
01:48:54,385 --> 01:48:57,265
You said you'd never
seen the ocean.

1690
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:00,696
Hurry up. Come on.

1691
01:49:00,796 --> 01:49:04,376
What?

1692
01:49:11,358 --> 01:49:16,246
Jeffrey? You know I can't see.

1693
01:49:16,346 --> 01:49:19,356
Where are we?
Jeffrey? Please.

1694
01:49:36,283 --> 01:49:38,308
Kathryn?

1695
01:49:45,959 --> 01:49:48,999
We have 9:30 reservations
for Key West.

1696
01:50:01,908 --> 01:50:06,127
I, uh...
just didn't recognize you.

1697
01:50:06,227 --> 01:50:10,843
Well, you look pretty different
yourself.

1698
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:15,801
It was always you.

1699
01:50:15,901 --> 01:50:19,689
In my dream.
It was al...

1700
01:50:21,795 --> 01:50:24,628
It was always you.

1701
01:50:26,933 --> 01:50:29,251
I remember you like this.

1702
01:50:29,351 --> 01:50:31,153
You do?

1703
01:50:31,253 --> 01:50:35,072
I felt I've known you before.

1704
01:50:37,044 --> 01:50:40,309
I feel I've always known you.

1705
01:50:51,091 --> 01:50:54,185
I'm so scared.

1706
01:51:26,693 --> 01:51:28,707
What time's your flight?

1707
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:31,146
9:30.
- Might be tight.

1708
01:51:31,246 --> 01:51:34,814
Tight? No.
My watch says 7:30.

1709
01:51:34,914 --> 01:51:38,450
On your normal mornin', okay.
Plenty of time.

1710
01:51:38,550 --> 01:51:40,510
But today you gotta
take into account...

1711
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:42,520
your Army of the
Twelve Monkeys factor.

1712
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:45,393
What? What'd you say?

1713
01:51:45,493 --> 01:51:47,604
Twelve Monkeys. In case you folks...

1714
01:51:47,704 --> 01:51:49,995
didn't turn on your
radio this mornin'.

1715
01:51:50,095 --> 01:51:53,666
Bunch of weirdos let all
of the animals out of the zoo.

1716
01:51:53,766 --> 01:51:55,511
They locked up this
big-shot scientist...

1717
01:51:55,611 --> 01:51:56,437
in one of the cages.

1718
01:51:56,537 --> 01:51:59,139
Scientist's own kid
one of the ones did it.

1719
01:51:59,239 --> 01:52:02,910
They've got animals
all over the place.

1720
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:05,848
Bunch of zebras closed down
the thruway 'bout an hour ago.

1721
01:52:05,948 --> 01:52:08,250
And they got some thing
called an emu.

1722
01:52:08,350 --> 01:52:12,419
It's got traffic blocked
for miles on 676.

1723
01:52:12,519 --> 01:52:14,273
...what they think
they're accomplishing...

1724
01:52:14,373 --> 01:52:15,791
by releasing an animal like this...

1725
01:52:15,891 --> 01:52:17,991
into a city like this one.
- Oh.

1726
01:52:18,091 --> 01:52:20,730
That's what they were
up to, freeing animals.

1727
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:21,830
On the walls.

1728
01:52:21,930 --> 01:52:23,897
It said, 'We did it.'
They meant the animals.

1729
01:52:23,997 --> 01:52:24,997
The animals, yeah.

1730
01:52:25,097 --> 01:52:28,870
If I could interrupt
for a moment, Mr. Ginger...

1731
01:52:28,970 --> 01:52:33,290
There is going to be
a press conference from City Hall.

1732
01:52:33,307 --> 01:52:36,820
I think it's gonna be all right.

1733
01:52:40,066 --> 01:52:42,087
Tell your people if
they spot either one...

1734
01:52:42,187 --> 01:52:44,015
of them, not to try
and apprehend them.

1735
01:52:44,115 --> 01:52:47,461
They should notify us.
We have people all...

1736
01:52:47,561 --> 01:52:50,841
over the airport.
We'll take care of 'em.

1737
01:52:52,479 --> 01:52:55,778
Skycap to gate 47, please.

1738
01:53:02,889 --> 01:53:04,393
...for Chicago...

1739
01:53:04,493 --> 01:53:07,826
is now ready for
boarding at gate 17.

1740
01:53:09,729 --> 01:53:13,548
Flight 623 to Minneapolis
is now boarding at gate...

1741
01:53:13,648 --> 01:53:17,408
I know this place.
- Airports all look the same.

1742
01:53:17,417 --> 01:53:20,373
This is my dream.

1743
01:53:23,009 --> 01:53:26,091
Your mustache.

1744
01:53:26,191 --> 01:53:29,397
It's not just my dream.

1745
01:53:29,497 --> 01:53:31,935
I was actually here.
I remember now.

1746
01:53:32,035 --> 01:53:35,247
I... About a week or
two before the...

1747
01:53:35,347 --> 01:53:37,873
before everyone started dying.

1748
01:53:37,973 --> 01:53:40,343
Oh. Uh, careful.

1749
01:53:40,443 --> 01:53:42,941
They might be looking for us.

1750
01:53:43,041 --> 01:53:47,748
I was here... as a kid.
- Use this.

1751
01:53:47,848 --> 01:53:50,118
I think you were here then too.
- James.

1752
01:53:50,218 --> 01:53:51,441
If they identify us,

1753
01:53:51,541 --> 01:53:53,719
they're going to
send us someplace,

1754
01:53:53,819 --> 01:53:57,024
but it won't be Key West.

1755
01:53:57,124 --> 01:53:59,726
Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1756
01:53:59,826 --> 01:54:02,130
I'll go fix this.
- Okay.

1757
01:54:02,230 --> 01:54:03,571
I'm gonna get the tickets.

1758
01:54:03,671 --> 01:54:05,601
I'll meet you in
the newspaper stand.

1759
01:54:05,701 --> 01:54:08,381
Okay.
- Okay.

1760
01:54:13,159 --> 01:54:16,978
This is a general
information announcement.

1761
01:54:17,078 --> 01:54:19,613
Judy Simmons. I have
reservations for Key West.

1762
01:54:19,713 --> 01:54:20,713
Okay.

1763
01:54:20,813 --> 01:54:24,951
Flight 623 to Minneapolis...

1764
01:54:25,051 --> 01:54:28,166
is now boarding at gate 44.

1765
01:54:31,311 --> 01:54:35,259
I don't see a lot of this. It's cash.
- It's a long story.

1766
01:54:35,359 --> 01:54:37,632
We'll begin boarding
in about 20 minutes.

1767
01:54:37,732 --> 01:54:40,552
You have a nice
flight, Miss Simmons.

1768
01:54:40,652 --> 01:54:42,652
Thank you.

1769
01:54:44,758 --> 01:54:47,727
Hello. How are you today?

1770
01:54:49,429 --> 01:54:51,814
I don't know whether
you're there or not.

1771
01:54:51,914 --> 01:54:53,912
Maybe you just clean carpets.

1772
01:54:54,012 --> 01:54:55,210
If you do, you're lucky.

1773
01:54:55,310 --> 01:54:57,184
You're gonna live
a long, happy life.

1774
01:54:57,284 --> 01:54:59,487
But if you other guys are out there,
if you're picking this up,

1775
01:54:59,587 --> 01:55:01,890
forget about
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

1776
01:55:01,990 --> 01:55:05,023
They didn't do it. It was a mistake.
Someone else did it.

1777
01:55:05,123 --> 01:55:08,393
The Army of the Twelve
Monkeys is just a...

1778
01:55:08,493 --> 01:55:11,933
bunch of dumb kids
playin' revolutionaries.

1779
01:55:12,552 --> 01:55:17,035
Listen. I've done my job.
I did what you wanted.

1780
01:55:17,135 --> 01:55:19,542
Good luck.
I'm not coming back.

1781
01:55:19,642 --> 01:55:23,046
Whoo-ee.
San Francisco, New Orleans.

1782
01:55:23,146 --> 01:55:26,144
Rio de Janeiro, Rome.

1783
01:55:26,244 --> 01:55:29,483
Kinshasa, Karachi,
Bangkok and Peking.

1784
01:55:29,583 --> 01:55:32,854
This is some trip you're taking, sir.
Is this all in one week?

1785
01:55:32,954 --> 01:55:35,339
Business.
- Hmm.

1786
01:55:36,176 --> 01:55:38,542
Have a good one, sir.

1787
01:55:41,881 --> 01:55:46,784
Any luggage found unattended
will be removed and destroyed.

1788
01:55:52,692 --> 01:55:56,173
Got yourself a prob, Bob?

1789
01:55:56,273 --> 01:55:58,273
Leave me alone.

1790
01:55:58,314 --> 01:56:01,817
I made a report. I
didn't have to do that.

1791
01:56:01,917 --> 01:56:03,051
Point of fact.

1792
01:56:03,151 --> 01:56:05,718
You don't belong here.

1793
01:56:05,818 --> 01:56:08,989
It's not permitted to let you stay.

1794
01:56:09,089 --> 01:56:11,359
This is the present.

1795
01:56:11,459 --> 01:56:14,363
This is not the past.
This is not the future.

1796
01:56:14,463 --> 01:56:18,997
This is right now.
I'm not leaving'. Get that?

1797
01:56:19,097 --> 01:56:21,734
You can't stop me.

1798
01:56:21,834 --> 01:56:25,754
Anything you say, Chief.
It's none of my business.

1799
01:56:30,497 --> 01:56:33,227
Passengers for flight...

1800
01:56:34,868 --> 01:56:37,686
Hey, Cole.
- Leave me alone.

1801
01:56:37,786 --> 01:56:41,537
Calm down, Cole. It's me.
Cole, it's me.

1802
01:56:42,976 --> 01:56:47,330
Jose?
- Yeah, right. Jose.

1803
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:50,963
Why'd you pull out the tooth?
That was nuts.

1804
01:56:51,063 --> 01:56:54,032
Here, take this.
- What? What for? Are you crazy?

1805
01:56:54,132 --> 01:56:59,272
Me? Are you kidding?
You're the one. You're a hero, man.

1806
01:56:59,372 --> 01:57:00,823
They gave you a
pardon. What do you do?

1807
01:57:00,923 --> 01:57:02,374
You come back and
fuck with your teeth.

1808
01:57:02,474 --> 01:57:05,834
How did you find me?
- The phone call, man.

1809
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:08,149
They did their
reconstruction thing on it.

1810
01:57:08,249 --> 01:57:12,419
The phone?
The phone call I just made?

1811
01:57:12,519 --> 01:57:14,890
Five minutes ago.
- Yeah, five minutes ago.

1812
01:57:14,990 --> 01:57:17,590
Thirty years ago.
They just put it together.

1813
01:57:17,690 --> 01:57:19,893
'Uh, hey, this is Cole, James.

1814
01:57:19,993 --> 01:57:21,452
I don't know whether you're there...

1815
01:57:21,552 --> 01:57:23,095
or not. Maybe you
just clean carpets.'

1816
01:57:23,195 --> 01:57:25,550
Where'd you get that from? 'Forget...

1817
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:28,070
about the Army of
the Twelve Monkeys.'

1818
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:30,972
Man, if only they could've
got your message earlier.

1819
01:57:31,072 --> 01:57:34,861
Take it. You could still be
a hero if you cooperate.

1820
01:57:34,961 --> 01:57:38,021
Come on, James.
It's okay.

1821
01:57:49,776 --> 01:57:54,130
Here's your change. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1822
01:57:54,230 --> 01:57:57,274
Sorry.
- No problem.

1823
01:58:00,887 --> 01:58:03,305
Hi.
- Hi.

1824
01:58:03,405 --> 01:58:07,872
Flight 784 for San Francisco
is ready for boarding at gate 38.

1825
01:58:07,972 --> 01:58:12,146
Flight 784 for San Francisco
is ready for boarding...

1826
01:58:12,246 --> 01:58:14,549
Oh, my God.

1827
01:58:14,649 --> 01:58:16,577
I got orders. You know
what I'm supposed...

1828
01:58:16,677 --> 01:58:18,650
to do if you don't go
along? Shoot the lady.

1829
01:58:18,750 --> 01:58:19,750
What?

1830
01:58:19,850 --> 01:58:21,787
You got that? They said,
'If Cole don't obey...'

1831
01:58:21,887 --> 01:58:26,228
I'll break your fuckin'...
You hear me?

1832
01:58:26,328 --> 01:58:29,577
Volunteers now
boarding at gate 37.

1833
01:58:31,284 --> 01:58:33,669
You see?
I had no choice.

1834
01:58:33,769 --> 01:58:38,247
These are my orders, man.
Just take it. Take it.

1835
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:45,544
This part isn't about
the virus at all, is it?

1836
01:58:45,644 --> 01:58:49,552
It's about followin' orders.
About doin' what you're told.

1837
01:58:49,652 --> 01:58:52,887
Hey, man. You got a pardon.
What do you want?

1838
01:58:52,987 --> 01:58:56,625
Who am I supposed to shoot?
Who am I supposed to shoot?

1839
01:58:56,725 --> 01:58:57,725
James. James.

1840
01:58:57,825 --> 01:58:59,965
Dr. Goines's assistant. He's an...

1841
01:59:00,065 --> 01:59:02,462
apocalypse nut. I
think he's involved.

1842
01:59:02,562 --> 01:59:04,799
The next flight to San Francisco
leaves from gate 38.

1843
01:59:04,899 --> 01:59:06,864
If he's there,
I'm sure he's part of it.

1844
01:59:06,964 --> 01:59:12,619
...please go to gate 13.

1845
01:59:16,496 --> 01:59:20,580
Mr. Holtz, you wanna have
a look at this, please?

1846
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:23,085
Excuse me, sir.
Would you mind...

1847
01:59:23,185 --> 01:59:24,921
letting me have a look at
the contents of your bag?

1848
01:59:25,021 --> 01:59:26,021
Me?

1849
01:59:26,121 --> 01:59:28,186
We don't have time for this.

1850
01:59:28,286 --> 01:59:30,765
Excuse me.

1851
01:59:34,747 --> 01:59:37,762
Biological samples.

1852
01:59:37,862 --> 01:59:40,899
I have the papers right here.
- Yeah.

1853
01:59:40,999 --> 01:59:44,705
I'm gonna have to ask you
to open this up, sir.

1854
01:59:44,805 --> 01:59:46,805
Open it?

1855
01:59:46,905 --> 01:59:49,143
Why, yes, of course.

1856
01:59:49,243 --> 01:59:51,811
What could be better?
Look over here.

1857
01:59:51,911 --> 01:59:53,816
Look at the planes.
Hurry up.

1858
01:59:53,916 --> 01:59:54,916
Excuse me.

1859
01:59:55,016 --> 01:59:57,151
Ma'am, you have to get in the line.

1860
01:59:57,251 --> 02:00:01,624
See? Biological.
Check the papers.

1861
02:00:01,724 --> 02:00:04,939
It's all proper.
I have a permit.

1862
02:00:10,183 --> 02:00:13,800
It's empty.
- Well, yes, to be sure.

1863
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:18,504
It looks empty;
but I assure you, it's not.

1864
02:00:18,604 --> 02:00:19,604
You don't understand.

1865
02:00:19,704 --> 02:00:21,977
No, I don't have to understand.
You have to get in line.

1866
02:00:22,077 --> 02:00:23,578
This is very important.
There's a man.

1867
02:00:23,678 --> 02:00:24,812
He's carrying a deadly virus.

1868
02:00:24,912 --> 02:00:29,835
There, you see?
Also invisible to the naked eye.

1869
02:00:31,804 --> 02:00:36,591
It doesn't...
even have an odor.

1870
02:00:36,691 --> 02:00:40,157
That's not necessary, sir.
There you go.

1871
02:00:40,257 --> 02:00:44,257
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a good flight.

1872
02:00:44,484 --> 02:00:46,484
Yeah.

1873
02:00:51,724 --> 02:00:55,172
Who are you calling a moron?
- I am calling you a fucking moron.

1874
02:00:55,272 --> 02:00:58,392
Fucking moron?
- Get your hands off her.

1875
02:00:58,598 --> 02:01:00,598
Hold it.

1876
02:01:00,650 --> 02:01:03,568
Wait a moment.

1877
02:01:10,209 --> 02:01:13,725
Fuckin' moron? You're not
gettin' through. Now get in the line.

1878
02:01:13,825 --> 02:01:15,974
I said stop.

1879
02:01:18,318 --> 02:01:21,400
There he is. That man.
He's carrying a deadly virus.

1880
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:24,388
Stop him.
Somebody, please stop him.

1881
02:01:25,124 --> 02:01:27,718
Police Offi...

1882
02:01:33,032 --> 02:01:36,399
He's got a gun.

1883
02:01:43,276 --> 02:01:45,938
Watch it.

1884
02:01:51,284 --> 02:01:54,102
No.

1885
02:01:54,202 --> 02:01:57,588
Freeze.

1886
02:04:15,027 --> 02:04:17,027
Excuse me.

1887
02:04:17,045 --> 02:04:21,979
It's obscene,
all the violence, all the lunacy.

1888
02:04:22,079 --> 02:04:25,386
Shootings even at airports now.

1889
02:04:25,486 --> 02:04:29,121
You might say that we're
the next endangered species.

1890
02:04:29,221 --> 02:04:32,094
Human beings.

1891
02:04:32,194 --> 02:04:36,308
I think you're right, ma'am.

1892
02:04:37,617 --> 02:04:40,737
I think you've hit
the nail on the head.

1893
02:04:42,788 --> 02:04:45,348
Jones is my name.

1894
02:04:49,929 --> 02:04:52,420
I'm in insurance.
