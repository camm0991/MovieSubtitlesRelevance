00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,024
Corpsman !

3
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,906
Corpsman !

4
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,368
Corpsman !

5
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,838
For God's sakes!
Corpsman !

6
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,010
Corpsman !

7
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,066
Corpsman !

8
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,114
What's wrong?

9
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,592
Every jackass thinks
he knows what war is.

10
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,513
Especially those who
have never been in one.

11
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:22,099
We Iike things nice and simpIe:

12
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,145
Good and evil, heroes and villains.

13
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:29,232
There's always plenty of both.

14
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:34,904
Most of the time, they are not
who we think they are.

15
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,841
Where is he?

16
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,177
Where is he?

17
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:03,140
Where, where is he?

18
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,186
Mr. Bradley?

19
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,190
Mr. B? You okay?

20
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,026
-Where is he?
-Where is who?

21
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:17,154
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where, where is he?

22
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,657
All right. Just stay right here, okay?

23
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:23,327
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.

24
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,956
Where is he?

25
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:33,838
Most guys I knew would never talk
about what happened over there.

26
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,300
Probably because they're still
trying to forget about it.

27
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:42,513
They certainly didn't
think of themselves as heroes.

28
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,852
They died without glory.

29
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,563
Nobody has taken their pictures.

30
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,065
Only their buddies knew what they did.

31
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:56,527
I'd tell their folks they died
for their country.

32
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,447
I'm not sure that was it.

33
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,199
Now, there were
plenty other photos taken that day. . .

34
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,577
. . . but none anybody wanted to see.

35
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,247
What we see and do in war. . .

36
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:12,627
. . .the cruelty, is unbelievable.

37
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,130
But somehow we gotta make
some sense of it.

38
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,717
To do that, we need
an easy-to-understand truth. . .

39
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,219
. . .and damn few words.

40
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,890
Film's ruined.

41
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,936
I don't know. This one looks all right.

42
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,275
And if you can get a picture....

43
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:44,617
Now, the right picture can win
or lose a war.

44
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,411
You're gonna want to see this.

45
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,372
Look at Vietnam.

46
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,832
The picture of that
South Vietnamese officer. . .

47
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,419
. . . blowing that fella's brains
out of the side of his head.

48
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,756
That was it.

49
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,258
The war was lost.

50
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,262
We just hung around
trying to pretend it wasn't.

51
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:11,852
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.

52
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,691
Thanks. Appreciate it.

53
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,704
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.

54
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,081
Country was bankrupt.

55
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,752
People were becoming cynical
and tired of war.

56
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,310
-Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon !
-Where?

57
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,314
Right there. Planting that flag,
that's your brother.

58
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,692
Ma, all you can see is his behind.

59
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,863
And that's his. I powdered
and diapered it, I know my son.

60
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,615
That's him. Go get your father.

61
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,910
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's
keister in the paper.

62
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,080
You watch your mouth, young man.

63
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,345
Thank you.

64
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:35,603
One photo, almost all on its own,
turned that around.

65
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,522
It's on the front page
of every major paper.

66
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:43,235
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded
with requests for prints.

67
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,448
I think we might have found it.

68
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,750
Corpsman!

69
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,585
Corpsman!

70
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:46,966
Corpsman !

71
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,926
-I gotta go get him.
-Oh, no, you don't.

72
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,427
Iggy, I gotta go.

73
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:54,515
I have a whole different theory. He wants
medical attention, he'll come to us.

74
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:58,477
Hey, shut up and crawl over here,
you lazy son of a bitch !

75
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,479
-As soon as that flare goes out.
-Crap.

76
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,606
-Okay, well, I'll go with you.
-No.

77
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,442
-You're gonna leave me here?
-I'll be right back, just--

78
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,987
Shoot some people. I gotta go.

79
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,042
Oh, God.

80
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,794
Okay, it's okay.

81
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,629
Don't touch them.

82
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,465
Get your hands out, let me do that.
Don't look.

83
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,384
Keep your head back, your eyes on me.

84
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,846
Look at me. I'll get it.
I'll take care of it.

85
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,057
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.

86
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,768
And we'll get you down
to the bottom, all right?

87
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,771
You're gonna be fine.

88
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,773
It's okay.

89
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,276
I'll do that. I'll do that.

90
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,946
Put some pressure on that. Put your
hands on top and put pressure on it.

91
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,032
Keep your head back. Keep breathing.

92
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,410
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at--

93
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,917
Doc.

94
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,962
Help me.

95
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,509
Help me.

96
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,201
How does that feel?

97
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,537
-It feels good.
-It does? All right.

98
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,207
-Good.
-All right.

99
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,918
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
I'll be right back.

100
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,128
I'm all right.

101
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,547
Go and help someone who's hurt.

102
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,134
All right. Hold on there.

103
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,690
-Where did he go?
-Who?

104
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,360
-The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
-You jumped in the wrong hole.

105
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,572
I didn't jump in the wrong hole! He
was right here, now where the hell is he?

106
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,575
Iggy!

107
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,619
Iggy!

108
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,038
Shut up. You want every Jap
shooting at us?

109
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,999
Iggy!

110
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,354
Holy shit.

111
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,607
They expect us to climb this?

112
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,780
Or something just like it.

113
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,123
So where you think they're sending us?

114
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,501
I think it's the desert, Franklin.

115
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,628
Well, that makes no sense at all.

116
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,630
Well, it's just military psychology.

117
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,217
They always train you for the desert
on a volcano.

118
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,930
Now you're just having fun with me.

119
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,517
Harlon, take your men right.
Watch for Bedouins.

120
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,979
-What's a Bedouin?
-It's a guy with a camel.

121
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:33,817
Well, jeez Louise,
maybe we are going to the desert.

122
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:39,239
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what
if the bullet comes from the left?

123
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:44,036
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?

124
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,997
That makes as much sense
as you showering with your shoes on.

125
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,333
You don't even know
why you do it, do you?

126
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,668
Because I don't tell you
mean I don't know?

127
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,129
You do it because Mike does it.

128
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,465
I'll ask him.

129
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,843
-So you cut hair back home?
-Some.

130
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,262
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?

131
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,432
No, I just studied it a little.

132
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,812
-But not in barber school?
-Nope.

133
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,690
Let me guess, Hayes is winning.

134
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,693
Chief, I had very little to do
with Sitting Bull's death. . .

135
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,029
. . .so maybe you could stop
taking it out on me.

136
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,700
Different tribe. The Pimas fought
on the side of the white man.

137
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,744
-See, now that's smart.
-That is smart.

138
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:29,373
Yeah. Worked real good for us.

139
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,958
Good luck, fellas.

140
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,960
Hey, good night, Lindberg.

141
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,131
Dead bodies. He cuts hair
on dead bodies.

142
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,883
Even I knew that.

143
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:44,721
-Who's in?
-Oh, I'm in.

144
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,434
It must be a lot easier with them
not moving around and all.

145
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,185
There's that.

146
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,521
You know what I been thinking?

147
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,441
Well, they been telling us
we need to buddy up. . .

148
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,068
. . .and I think we'd make
pretty good buddies.

149
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,736
And how do you figure that?

150
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,657
Well, you know, in that we
have a lot in common.

151
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,994
So why do you cut dead people's
hair, anyway?

152
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,746
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.

153
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,293
You tell a lot of people that?

154
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,754
You actually chose the Marines
because they got the best uniform?

155
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:22,342
No sense being a hero
if you don't look like one.

156
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,180
Jacks.

157
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,348
Queens.

158
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,767
Shit.

159
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,062
Do anything on that reservation
but play cards, chief?

160
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:37,816
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch
of leathernecks!

161
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:42,654
We going over the side tomorrow
which means we ain't long for this rock.

162
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,156
-All right!
-About time.

163
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,159
Any man who doesn't
have his masturbation papers in order. . .

164
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,745
. . .get them signed by tomorrow
or he ain't going.

165
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,164
-I got mine already.
-Oh, yeah. I'm square.

166
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,500
Wait. Why am I just hearing about this?

167
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,835
I don't have to repeat everything
twice for you.

168
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,380
No, I didn't hear nothing
about no masturbating papers.

169
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,591
Heard they were running short.

170
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,720
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.

171
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:11,099
All right, get over to the officer in charge
of records. Maybe he's got more.

172
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,269
-Leave your smokes. I'll play for you.
-Thanks, Mike.

173
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,189
Listen, he calls you an idiot,
you take it like a man, okay?

174
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,399
Just do not leave without signing them.

175
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,818
-I appreciate it, sergeant.
-You got it.

176
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,161
What the hell happened
to your hair, Rene?

177
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,372
Look like a goddamn corpse.

178
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,922
Three points of contact on that rope
at all times.

179
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,634
Next four. Over the side.

180
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,095
Let's go. Keep moving.

181
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,138
Next four, over the side.

182
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,600
Keep your eye on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.

183
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,852
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.

184
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,273
Keep three points of contact
on the rope at all times.

185
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,528
You see? No big thing.

186
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,031
Just one step at a time and keep
your hands on the vertical rope.

187
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,866
Once you're in the boat, move away.

188
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,661
Make sure you keep three points
of contact on the rope.

189
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,582
-I got him !
-All right, get that man out of the water.

190
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,375
Give me a hand.

191
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:23,463
-Don't worry about him, Doc.
-All right, quit skylarking ! Keep moving.

192
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,049
He'll be fine.

193
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,802
Our target, Island X. . .

194
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:33,640
. . . is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab
of rock called Iwo Jima.

195
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,893
It means Sulfur Island,
which accounts for the smell.

196
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,897
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop,
you ask me.

197
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,611
After 20 straight days of bombing
you won't find a blade of grass. . .

198
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,905
. . .or a twig on it. It wasn't that pretty
to start with.

199
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,282
Captain?

200
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,660
Iwo's just five and a half miles long,
two and a half wide.

201
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,289
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.

202
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,708
On the maps in front of you
the island is white.

203
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,917
Not much of it.

204
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,671
The black dots represent
known enemy emplacements.

205
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,717
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-
purpose guns, covered artillery.

206
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,927
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns. . .

207
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,723
. . . machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes,
and earth-covered structures.

208
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,434
I don't see any barracks
or any other structures.

209
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,102
That's right.

210
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,896
And we still don't know why.

211
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,940
Now, this isn't just any island to them.

212
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:28,528
This isn't Tarawa, Guam,
Tinian, or Saipan.

213
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,948
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.

214
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,951
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders
in eight square miles.

215
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,537
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.

216
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,247
It's up to us to convince them.

217
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,834
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.

218
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,088
The 8th Ammo Company
will land here to resupply.

219
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,966
The Suribachi's guns are the problem.
They can hit any point on the island.

220
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,553
We're sitting ducks until
we take them out. That's our job.

221
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,974
We cut across the island at the base,
slit its throat, lop off its head.

222
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:02,562
And we take that mountain. We take
that mountain, we take their big guns.

223
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,773
We take their eyes.

224
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,288
Okay, l'm heading in.
Follow me.

225
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,541
Let's put a good show on
for the Marines.

226
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,751
Close it up. Take it right down
to the deck.

227
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,144
Yeah, boys!

228
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,442
Man overboard portside!

229
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,076
See him?

230
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,039
-Throw me a line!
-He's right there.

231
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,209
-Where is he?
-Watch out, watch out, watch out.

232
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,628
Hawaii's that way!

233
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:15,635
Just keep paddling, Mac,
we'll catch you on the way back!

234
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,805
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!

235
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,641
They're not gonna stop.

236
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,226
What?

237
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:27,063
None of them are. They can't.

238
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,072
So much for "no man left behind."

239
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,998
-Sir.
-Come on in.

240
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,627
Look, I've had to make a few
other changes. I'm promoting you. . .

241
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,754
. . .to platoon sergeant.

242
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,674
-Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
-You bet.

243
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,886
Trouble is, I already told my men
I'd see them through this.

244
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,265
That your James Cagney impersonation?
Because I've heard better.

245
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,643
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.

246
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,147
This isn't your first time.
You don't need to prove anything.

247
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,857
No, sir.

248
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:16,112
You're not the best sergeant, you're just
the best one that's still walking.

249
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,114
-Block's a good man.
-Yes, sir, he is.

250
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,700
The men know him, he can step right in.

251
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,205
You know, I have actually
thought this through.

252
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,124
Platoon sergeant puts you further away
from the bullets.

253
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,086
I already gave them my word, sir.

254
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,004
I told them I'd bring them all home.

255
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,258
Which means I already lied
to half of them. Can't lie to the rest.

256
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:40,887
How are your men?

257
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,889
They'll do fine.

258
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,724
Except maybe Gagnon.

259
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,936
Our own Tyrone Power?

260
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,146
Yes, sir. He's a good man, just. . .

261
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:53,149
. . . might be better use further back
from the lines.

262
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,153
I'll use him as a runner.

263
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,739
All right. Thank you, sir.

264
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,575
Now get out of here.

265
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,167
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.

266
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,754
Hey, you do that again
I'll take your head off!

267
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,172
Fucking dominoes.

268
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,760
Iggy, have you ever heard news
you considered to be bad?

269
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,263
The first ones off the ship, Doc.

270
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,849
We don't go over the side of the ship.

271
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,268
We hop on a tractor,
they drive us right there.

272
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,854
Oh, shit, that is good news.

273
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,523
You see? What did I tell you?

274
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,157
What's going on?

275
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,620
-I'm going up to take a look.
-Let's go.

276
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,496
Let's go topside. Come on !

277
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,373
-I'll go with you.
-Come on, come on !

278
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,917
What the hell?

279
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,794
-Let's go, let's go!
-Right behind you.

280
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,643
Look at that.

281
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,396
We're killing them !
We're killing them, Doc.

282
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:42,258
I was promised 10 days of shelling.

283
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,428
You're giving me three and saying
that's the best you can do?

284
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,765
I don't give a shit! My men hit that beach
with less than 10. . .

285
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,643
. . .and I'll be taking them home
to their mamas in buckets!

286
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,064
Yeah, I know exactly why.

287
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,025
Because every Navy man
with a scrambled egg on his chest. . .

288
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,861
. . .wants to offload us here
and sail to Japan. . .

289
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,031
. . .so they can be there for the big finish.

290
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,284
Tell their kids they captured the emperor
all by themselves.

291
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:12,956
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless
we take this piece-of-shit island !

292
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,084
These little pricks are dug in !

293
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:23,967
Okay. Appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.

294
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,307
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?

295
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,351
I'm okay.

296
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:38,732
-Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
-Jesus, Iggy, leave me alone, all right?

297
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:43,236
How about you guys? Knife? Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?

298
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,656
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?

299
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,700
You sharpened it three times already.

300
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,578
Then I better make sure I didn't nick it.

301
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,123
Good man, Doc.

302
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,337
-Hey, Doc.
-Yeah.

303
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,217
When we land, try not to wave
this kit around too much.

304
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,386
They got sharpshooters trained
to look for them.

305
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,430
They know if they
take out a corpsman. . .

306
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,099
. . .another dozen Marines will die
unattended.

307
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,101
Okay, Mike.

308
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,817
Yeah, right there.

309
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:57,393
-Close the damn door. For God's sake.
-Yeah, like that's gonna help.

310
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,152
That your girlfriend, chief?

311
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,740
Bet she's a pretty damn
good-looking squaw.

312
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,410
Bet you're missing her,
and that little wigwam of yours.

313
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,715
Welcome, all Marines off lwo Jima.

314
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,425
We have a long-time wait--

315
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,594
It's what they do to prisoners. . .

316
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,225
. . .at least the lucky ones.

317
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,852
Jesus.

318
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:44,190
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think
about waving a white bandanna.

319
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,695
Poor Marines, so far from home
for no good reason.

320
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,408
Think of your girls back home,
waiting for you.

321
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,494
But a girl cannot stay home
every night...

322
00:24:56,704 --> 00:25:00,373
...so who do you think
they're with tonight?

323
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:05,962
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?

324
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:10,592
This sweet music is to make you
think of your girls back home...

325
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,218
...who are missing you.

326
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:16,472
This is all for now.
l'll see you tomorrow night.

327
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,640
We're clear!

328
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:08,936
Get up the berm !

329
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,649
Baker Company, move out!

330
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,651
-Seen Second Platoon?
-I don't see them.

331
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,363
-First squad, move out!
-God, this place reeks.

332
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,670
-Go, go, go!
-Move out!

333
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:40,676
Go, go, go! Go, go! Go!
Go, go! Drop your packs! Go!

334
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,595
All clear!

335
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,683
Jesus, you needed some exercise?

336
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,437
He got lost. 100 landing craft heading
for one beach and this guy gets lost.

337
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,689
I'm glad we did. Jesus, what a mess.

338
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,567
Any theories why they ain't shooting?

339
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,695
It's getting on my nerves.

340
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,781
Maybe they're all dead.

341
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,699
What do you think, Doc?

342
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:07,120
-You think they're all dead?
-Keep moving, Easy Company! Let's go!

343
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,727
Mike, take six men and bring that gun
onto the beach.

344
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:35,231
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down. Come on.

345
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,275
Move! Move!

346
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:16,939
-Get down !
-Take cover!

347
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,942
Move out!

348
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:31,370
Go, go! Get up on the beach !
Get up on the berm !

349
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:37,543
Go, go, go!

350
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,551
Cover fire! Pour it on !

351
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,557
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!

352
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,860
Corpsman !

353
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:07,573
I'm gonna sling your arm and then
I'll give you a shot for the pain.

354
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:12,828
Move, move! Off the beach !
Take cover!

355
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,377
Dig in ! Dig in !

356
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:22,838
First Platoon ! Move, move!

357
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,639
You got a girl back home, Marine?

358
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,933
We're gonna make sure
she sees you, all right?

359
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,019
Hey, I need pressure on this wound !

360
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:43,317
-See anything?
-Negative! Pull that fire team up!

361
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,903
Where's the fire coming from?

362
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,583
Where are they?

363
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,210
Look for a flash, shoot at it!

364
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,297
Let's go, let's--

365
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,641
-Move it out!
-Move, move! Let's go!

366
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,150
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!

367
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,320
You're over!

368
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,332
Third Squad, forward ! Move!

369
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,803
Where are they, sir?

370
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,848
We got ten o'clock! Ten o'clock,
pillbox! Sergeant!

371
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,935
Sergeant. I think I can clear that out.

372
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,520
All right, you go. Here.

373
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,690
Take these. Check your weapon.

374
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,527
Yeah? Go! Cover!
Cover him !

375
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,285
Cover, cover!

376
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,375
Son of a bitch.

377
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,508
-Let's go! Go!
-Move it out!

378
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,971
Go, go, go!

379
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,143
Down, down, down !

380
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,539
-It's clear.
-Good work.

381
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,426
-I thought you said it was clear!
-It was!

382
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,727
Shit, I guess they're not in there
firing at us then.

383
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,146
Lindberg !

384
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,522
Yeah !

385
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,023
Light it up!

386
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:34,029
-I'll cover you, Ice!
-Don't cover shit!

387
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,198
There's already enough people shooting.

388
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,201
One bullet and this thing goes up
like a Roman candle.

389
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,704
Go! Shift fire!

390
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,622
-Shift your fire!
-Go, go!

391
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,711
Shift your fire!

392
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,050
Go! Go!

393
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,080
Hit the deck! Stay down !
Wait for support!

394
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,667
Is this a bad battle or what?

395
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,086
-It's a fucking slaughter.
-Get down !

396
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,092
Corpsman !

397
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,433
Christ Jesus!

398
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,651
Get a machine gun team
set up over here now!

399
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,986
Corpsman ! Corpsman !

400
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,200
Thank God ! Tanks! Runner!

401
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,036
Get those tanks up here!

402
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,290
-Oh, shit.
-Man. Get down !

403
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:11,126
Corporal, watch your left flank!

404
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,087
-Let's go without them !
-Let's go!

405
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,547
-Move out! Move out!
-Let's go!

406
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:17,258
Let's go, move it. Let's go!

407
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,951
Iggy, you gotta lift your side,
he's gonna roll off.

408
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,744
Got it, Doc!

409
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:50,165
Incoming !

410
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,167
Corpsman !

411
00:36:55,755 --> 00:37:00,134
-Move, move, move!
-Everybody off the LVT, now!

412
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,177
Give them cover fire!

413
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,186
Corpsman !

414
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,161
Keep moving !

415
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,997
Get that LVT up on the beach !

416
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,208
Keep moving !

417
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,343
You're next, pal,
we're getting you out of here.

418
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,389
Move it!

419
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,405
Great news.

420
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:08,035
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa,
because that's where we're headed.

421
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,246
Not you and me.

422
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:15,417
Captain Severance asked who else was in
that picture. Christ if I could remember. . .

423
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:18,629
. . . but it was Mike and Doc and
Franklin and me and Hank Hansen. . .

424
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,799
. . . but I just remembered,
you were there too.

425
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,055
I wasn't there.

426
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,848
Of course you were.

427
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:33,811
Neither was Hank. He raised the first flag.
Harlon Block raised that one.

428
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,231
Shit. I told them it was Hank.

429
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,651
If you weren't there,
how'd you know it was Harlon?

430
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,320
-You tell them it was me?
-No. I just remembered.

431
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,155
Good, keep your mouth shut.

432
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,409
They know there was
somebody else, by the picture.

433
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,203
-Pick someone dead.
-They don't want somebody dead. . .

434
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,248
. . .they want to ship us back
to the States.

435
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,291
What did I tell you?

436
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:01,547
-I wasn't there. You hear?
-All right.

437
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,967
Just settle down.

438
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,804
-I'm not going anywhere.
-You're not going anywhere.

439
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,811
You wounded, son?

440
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,354
No, sir.

441
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,524
Did you take out a nest of Japs
butt-naked with your bare hands?

442
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,526
Because if I'm gonna
give up my seat. . .

443
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:07,446
. . .to a hero, he better have
a good goddamn story to tell.

444
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,114
No, sir.

445
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:13,619
Then enjoy it, because they'll forget you
before Christmas.

446
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,313
Sixth man, you got a name?

447
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,398
Sorry, still don't remember.

448
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:47,361
Damn shame, because I promised
the major you'd know who it was.

449
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:51,740
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on
you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.

450
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,743
Since no one wants to be embarrassed,
the moment you land. . .

451
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:59,414
. . .they'll turn around, ship you to Okinawa
to meet your buddies on the beach.

452
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,416
So why don't you stop
screwing with me?

453
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,377
Give me a damn name.

454
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,605
Gangway!
Gangway! Let's go, let's go! Gangway!

455
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:27,401
Where the hell is that son of a bitch?
Hayes! Hayes!

456
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:30,612
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Looks like I don't know. . .

457
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:33,991
. . .what my men are doing with a flag
the size of my mother's house?

458
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,203
Damn it, you shouldn't have lied to me.
Made me look like a complete asshole.

459
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:41,415
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.

460
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:50,966
Now your name's in the paper too.

461
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,472
Just heard your doctor
say we're postponing your operation.

462
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,516
You're being shipped back
to the mainland.

463
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:03,770
Everybody who saw that picture
thought planting the flag meant victory.

464
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:08,192
That's all they wanted to know.
Victory.

465
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:12,571
Within a few weeks of that picture
being taken, half the men in it were dead.

466
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,491
Mrs. Hansen. Mrs. Hansen.
Did you know Hank was a hero?

467
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,077
-Are you proud of him?
-What was he like as a boy?

468
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:22,998
-Look this way, please, ma'am.
-What do you have to say about your son?

469
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:27,085
But, somehow,
being a part of it meant something.

470
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:33,508
Looking at it, you could believe
their sacrifice was not a waste.

471
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,681
Yeah, I might have thought
that was Harlon too.

472
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:41,558
It is.

473
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,811
Belle, their names are right here.

474
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:46,813
It's not him.

475
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:52,319
And he would be alive
and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.

476
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:56,615
You think about that
when you look at his picture, Ed.

477
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:07,394
And I need to rush home and change
because there's the governor's banquet. . .

478
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,563
. . .and then there's the parade.

479
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,150
Imagine, the governor
is coming here to meet us.

480
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,193
Now, I'm wearing blue so--

481
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:19,364
We interrupt this program to bring you a
news bulletin from CBS World News.

482
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,909
A press association has just announced
that President Roosevelt is dead.

483
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,620
The president died
of a cerebral hemorrhage.

484
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:30,584
All we know so far is that the president
died at Warm Springs in Georgia.

485
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,628
Further updates every hour.

486
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:36,006
Temperatures will remain
the same today...

487
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:39,009
. . .in the mid-30s to low-40s
with clear skies.

488
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,677
Hello?

489
00:44:41,054 --> 00:44:43,805
Yes. Of course.

490
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:48,226
No, we understand.
It wouldn't be right.

491
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,645
Thank you.

492
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,444
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.

493
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:01,239
Senator Haddigan, I'd like you to meet
Private First Class Ira Hayes.

494
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,241
Damn good to meet you.

495
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,744
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.

496
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,666
Sorry?

497
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,671
That's Pima Indian talk,
don't you know your own language?

498
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:18,924
Took forever to memorize
the damn gibberish.

499
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,636
Sorry, I've been away
from the reservation too long, senator.

500
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:29,810
-Doc.
-Ira.

501
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:32,813
And now, the heroes of lwo Jima!

502
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:36,483
-That's you.
-Go, go, go.

503
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,693
Please welcome. . . .

504
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:12,727
Yeah. Yeah.

505
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,240
Holy shit.

506
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:28,326
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.

507
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,245
-Rene Gagnon.
-Bud Gurber.

508
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,165
-Showing the boys the sights?
-Saw a hell of a ball game.

509
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,500
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.

510
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,129
I got some briefing sheets for you,
some simple things we want you to say.

511
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:42,757
Mostly "Buy bonds."
Can't say that too often.

512
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,471
Itineraries, those'll change every minute.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.

513
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,807
I got women sending up envelopes
with stockings in them. . .

514
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:52,476
. . . notes written in lipstick.

515
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,269
We won't mention that to the press.

516
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:56,771
Have a drink, for chrissake.

517
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,357
My God, what you boys
must've seen over there.

518
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:03,862
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.

519
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,156
So. . .

520
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,034
. . .we got a hell of a lot of money
to raise, not much time.

521
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,244
White House tomorrow,
then you shake hands. . .

522
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:14,122
. . .with a few hundred congressmen
who won't pull out a penny.

523
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,707
Politicians and actors.

524
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,793
Put them in a restaurant,
they'd die before paying the check.

525
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,546
Then New York City, Times Square. . .

526
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,508
. . .dinners with various hoi polloi,
then Chicago.

527
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:26,468
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?

528
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,804
That's what we're calling the mothers
of the dead flag-raisers.

529
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,933
You present each mother with a flag,
they say a few words. . .

530
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:35,810
. . . people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.

531
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,396
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.

532
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,608
Lovely woman. She knows how close
you and her son were.

533
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:45,529
He wrote home about you. She is very
much looking forward to meeting you.

534
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:48,532
Hank wasn't in the picture.

535
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,116
Sorry?

536
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,495
Hank didn't raise that flag.

537
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,622
He raised the other one, the real flag.

538
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,833
The what? The real flag?
There's a real flag?

539
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:03,004
Ours was the replacement flag. We put
it up when they took the other one down.

540
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:06,341
Am I the only one getting
a headache here? You know about this?

541
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:10,637
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already been told, Bud.

542
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,889
That's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.

543
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:16,893
Why tell me? I'm only the guy that
has to explain it to 150 million Americans.

544
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:20,855
Who's in the goddamn picture? Are any
of you guys in the goddamn picture?

545
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,857
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.

546
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,860
Six guys raising a flag over Iwo Jima.
Victory is ours.

547
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,363
-You're three of them?
-This was the fifth day.

548
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,448
The battle went on for 35 more.

549
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:33,868
What'd you do, raise a damn flag
every time you stopped for lunch?

550
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,870
Can I hit this guy?

551
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:40,625
I don't give a shit, you raised the flag,
that's the story we're selling, boys.

552
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:44,170
Are you deaf? Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.

553
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:45,880
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?

554
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:50,802
Harlon Block. That's whose mother
should be here if anyone's should be.

555
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,973
You know, I think this whole damn thing
is a farce, if you ask me.

556
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:17,245
You know what they're calling
this bond drive? The Mighty Seventh.

557
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:21,041
They might've called it the "We're Flat
Broke so We're Begging for Pennies". . .

558
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,919
. . . bond drive, but it didn't have
the ring. They could've called it that. . .

559
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,465
. . . because the last bond drives came
so short we printed money instead.

560
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,675
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street. . .

561
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,928
. . .our dollar is next to worthless,
we borrowed so much.

562
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,848
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.

563
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:40,518
Tanks aren't being built. Machine guns,
bazookas, hand grenades, zip.

564
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,855
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?

565
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,940
Stuff some rocks in your pockets. . .

566
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,652
. . . because that's all we got
to throw at the Japanese.

567
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:51,404
And don't be surprised
if your plane doesn't make it. . .

568
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:53,239
. . . because the fuel dumps are empty.

569
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:56,117
And our good friends the Arabs
are only taking bullion.

570
00:49:56,369 --> 00:50:00,622
If we don't raise 14 billion dollars--
And that's million with a "B."

571
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,874
--this war is over
by the end of the month.

572
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,710
We give the Japanese
whatever they want and we come home.

573
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,963
You've seen them fight,
and they sure as shit ain't giving up.

574
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:13,968
Fourteen billion. The last three drives
didn't make that much altogether.

575
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:21,101
People on the street corners, they looked
at this picture and they took hope.

576
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:25,397
Don't ask me why, I think it's crappy,
myself. You can't even see your faces.

577
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:29,776
But it said, "We can win this war,
are winning this war. . .

578
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,986
. . .we just need you to
dig a little deeper."

579
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:35,990
They wanna give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.

580
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,993
But you don't want to ask for it,
give them hope.

581
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:42,789
You want to explain
about this person and that flag.

582
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,583
Well, that's your choice.

583
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:49,379
Because if we admit we made a mistake,
that's all anybody'll talk about. . .

584
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,798
. . .and that will be that.

585
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:02,726
Gentlemen.

586
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,020
Mr. President, here they are.

587
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:09,065
-Well, hello. Good to see you.
-Mr. President.

588
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:10,984
Darn good to see you, boys.

589
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,821
Heard you had a hell of a fight
on your hands out there, hell of a fight.

590
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,408
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation
in Arizona, am I right?

591
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,493
Yes, Mr. President.

592
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:24,038
Being an Indian,
you are a truer American than any of us.

593
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,041
Bet your people are proud
you're in that uniform.

594
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,376
Very proud, sir.

595
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,713
They should be.
Thank you for coming all this way. . .

596
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,550
. . .to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific. . .

597
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,553
. . . now we need you to fight
for a mountain of cash.

598
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,847
-I don't expect you'll let us down.
-No, sir.

599
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,224
-No, sir.
-Good. Then go get it.

600
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,643
That's the end of this ceremony.

601
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,355
Let's take a look at this famous photo
over here, see if I can pick you out.

602
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:53,485
My gosh. There you are.

603
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,996
Boys. Boys, this one's on me.

604
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,333
-To those who can't be with us.
-Yes, sir.

605
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:14,881
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?

606
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:17,884
I suppose.

607
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,136
And your name is?

608
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:24,182
I get the impression I'm drinking
with the wrong heroes.

609
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:28,686
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.

610
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,355
That's just not true.

611
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:37,570
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.

612
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,124
Here they are.
You're the guys in the photograph, right?

613
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,670
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands. John Tennack.

614
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,421
John Bradley.

615
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:58,132
These boys, Harvard and Yale types,
didn't fight.

616
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:02,637
Pappies all rich sons of bitches. Boys,
shake hands with some real war heroes.

617
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,931
Excuse me for one moment.

618
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,933
Buy them a drink while you're at it.

619
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,435
Drinks for these men all the way around.

620
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:12,146
And you're the other one,
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.

621
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:15,275
-Rene Gagnon.
-Pleased to meet you. Have a drink.

622
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:19,112
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene.

623
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,948
When you get finished being famous,
you come see me. . .

624
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,868
. . . because if you can sell bonds,
you can sell homes.

625
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:28,246
Now, they're not gonna build homes
anymore, they're gonna deliver them.

626
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,123
-Heard of prefab homes?
-No, sir.

627
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:34,043
You will. And you hang on to that card
and you come see me, you hear?

628
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,336
-All right?
-Certainly will.

629
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:36,921
All right.

630
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:45,179
It's all right.

631
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,190
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?

632
00:53:57,192 --> 00:54:00,361
If Mike and the guys could see us.

633
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,698
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it,
would they?

634
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,869
Harlon !

635
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,082
Franklin !

636
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,630
Can you imagine Franklin. . .

637
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:22,300
. . .on this train. . .

638
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:27,221
. . .eating at the dining car
with all the silver?

639
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,228
We shouldn't be here, Doc.

640
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:34,956
Ira! Hey, Ira.
We heard the picture was posed.

641
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,292
-What?
-We heard you posed the picture!

642
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:40,294
Hey, Doc.

643
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:50,263
We're bigger than life, Doc.

644
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,877
-Hey, good job.
-Thank you.

645
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:33,347
Thank you, girls. And now. . .

646
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,601
. . . here are the men
you've been waiting to meet. . .

647
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,644
. . .the men in white.

648
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:42,899
Right behind me, here,
the heroes of Iwo Jima:

649
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:46,360
Private First Class Rene Gagnon. . .

650
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:48,738
. . . Private First Class Ira Hayes. . .

651
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:53,367
. . .and Navy Corpsman
John "Doc" Bradley!

652
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,172
Thank you.

653
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:13,930
It's good of you to come out tonight
in support of the war effort.

654
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,557
We really need you to buy bonds,
that's for sure.

655
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:19,352
Because we can't win the war
without your help.

656
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:23,397
As far as us
being the heroes of Iwo Jima. . .

657
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:26,359
. . .that's just not the case.

658
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,319
We really didn't do much at all.

659
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,321
Especially him.

660
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,074
Especially me.

661
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,202
I was just a runner. That's it.

662
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,412
We put up a flag.

663
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:42,416
The pole we attached it to was heavy,
so it took a number of us.

664
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:45,294
We had our picture taken doing it.

665
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:50,299
The real heroes are dead on that island.

666
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:54,428
We'd appreciate it if you bought bonds
in honor of them. Thank you.

667
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,906
Jump on any grenades, Ira?

668
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:17,034
Take out any machine gun nests
I missed?

669
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:21,122
-At least I fired my weapon.
-All right, knock it off.

670
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,624
You hit anything
or were you too drunk then too?

671
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:27,253
Hey, hey, hey. Guys! Come on.

672
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,381
Stop it. Knock it off.

673
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:11,297
Sit between these two boys.

674
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:24,477
--for us and they need our help.

675
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:28,606
And if you think about it,
I think you'll realize. . .

676
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:33,611
. . .that buying more bonds
is not just the right thing to do. . .

677
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,696
. . . but the only thing to do.

678
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:41,494
Yes, this war has gone on too long.

679
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:45,581
We have given too many lives.
And its cost--

680
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,792
-Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
-Strawberry.

681
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:52,129
--has been far too high.
But if we waver now. . .

682
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:57,343
. . . if we don't dig deep
and give more than we think we can. . .

683
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,471
. . .then those sacrifices
would be wasted. . .

684
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:05,017
-Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
-. . .and those lives lost in vain.

685
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,660
Move! Go, go!

686
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:57,338
Corpsman !

687
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:11,143
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?

688
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:13,687
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says go without them.

689
01:02:13,814 --> 01:02:15,481
Christ.

690
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,775
Real good work you're doing there,
Rene.

691
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:22,029
Prepare to move out. Pass the word.

692
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,281
-Prepare to move out!
-Second Platoon !

693
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:27,076
-Move! Move!
-All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!

694
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,703
-Let's move out!
-Jackass.

695
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:32,415
-Let's move out!
-Go, go, go!

696
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:36,043
Move, go, go, move, move!

697
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:53,310
Corpsman !

698
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,697
Doc!

699
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,741
Doc, get out of there!

700
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,210
Corpsman !

701
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,296
Doc!

702
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,930
Doc, get the hell out of there!

703
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:38,939
May I have your attention, please?

704
01:03:39,191 --> 01:03:43,777
Train number 48,
with service from New York City...

705
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:47,072
...Boston, Rochester, New York...

706
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:50,784
...Toledo, Ohio, South Bend, lndiana...

707
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,787
...is now arriving on Track 7.

708
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:57,124
Train number 48,
now arriving on Track number 7.

709
01:03:57,334 --> 01:04:00,044
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

710
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,798
-Come on, let's go.
-Boys.

711
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,968
-Watch your step, now.
-Thank you very much.

712
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,346
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

713
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:12,806
-Watch your step.
-Let me help you, ma'am.

714
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:32,785
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present the heroes of Iwo Jima.

715
01:04:34,955 --> 01:04:38,332
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.

716
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:43,420
-Private First Class Ira Hayes.
-Excuse me, let me through, please.

717
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,591
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.

718
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:50,844
Rene! That's my boyfriend !

719
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:55,182
-Who the hell is that?
-I don't know.

720
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,977
-Rene, is that your girl?
-Hey, what do they call you?

721
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,396
Hey, look at that!

722
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:04,650
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?

723
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,860
Hey, she's a beauty.

724
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:15,119
Let's go find a saloon.

725
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:28,632
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's worth.

726
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,053
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?

727
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:36,640
Where exactly are you staying?

728
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,892
-Oh, I'm not sure yet.
-Just forget about that.

729
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:42,938
-Who's the dreamboat?
-Hey, Rene, a big smile.

730
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,318
Come on, one more shot.

731
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:54,241
Senator, I'd like you to meet
Corpsman John Bradley.

732
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:55,826
-Doc, right?
-Yes, sir.

733
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,912
Good to meet you. Now, we
appreciate everything you've done. . .

734
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,915
-. . .and everything you're doing.
-Thank you, sir.

735
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,251
This is Captain White.

736
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,629
-Colonel Johns.
-We're proud of you, corpsman.

737
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,088
And then Colonel McCourtney.

738
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,633
-Major General Green.
-Nice to meet you.

739
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:16,096
Senator,
this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.

740
01:06:16,348 --> 01:06:17,681
Of course.

741
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:20,976
Now, I hear you used a tomahawk
on those Japs, is that true, chief?

742
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:22,936
No, sir.

743
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:26,398
Well, tell them you did.
Makes a better story, huh?

744
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:29,902
-Attaboy.
-This is Captain Green.

745
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:33,030
John?

746
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,116
Madeline Evelley.
I recognize you from all the photographs.

747
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:38,035
I'm Hank's mom.

748
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:42,247
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.

749
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:45,959
-This is PFC Rene Gagnon.
-Pleasure to meet you, son.

750
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,961
-Thank you, sir.
-Thanks for everything.

751
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,838
-My pleasure.
-Not at all.

752
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:54,259
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank,
Mike's mom.

753
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:10,150
It's all right.

754
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:13,570
When I got the telegram, I. . . .

755
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:17,157
I don't know
what I'm trying to say here.

756
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:24,039
Knowing he was with you that day
and seeing him in that photograph. . .

757
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:27,418
. . . I don't know why it makes me
feel better, but it does.

758
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,963
-It's so silly, isn't it?
-No, it's not.

759
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:34,007
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.

760
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,262
We're the largest
furniture wholesaler in Illinois.

761
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:42,099
-Thank you. Excuse me.
-I'll make sure he calls.

762
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,018
-Well, thank you. Thank you.
-Thank you.

763
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,770
Are you Rene?

764
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,606
Yes, ma'am.

765
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:55,821
I'm Franklin's mother.

766
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,076
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.

767
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:06,498
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.

768
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,501
Would you mind?

769
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:20,053
Paper said that's Hank. . .

770
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,181
. . .and I honestly can't tell.

771
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:26,810
It's horrible of a mother
not to know her own son, isn't it?

772
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,812
But that's him, isn't it?

773
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,442
Well, to be honest, ma'am,
it happened so quick. . .

774
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:37,863
. . .and with everything that was going on
it's hard to remember who was where.

775
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:41,074
But. . .

776
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:45,454
. . .yeah, I think that's where he was.

777
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:47,206
That's Hank.

778
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:49,082
Thank you.

779
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,251
Excuse me.

780
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:55,088
I'm so sorry for your loss.

781
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:00,761
Excuse us.

782
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:18,111
Take him outside.

783
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:22,699
I'm Pauline. Nice to meet you.

784
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:28,539
He was the best Marine I ever knew.

785
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,124
Thank you.

786
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:43,554
-You okay, chief?
-Christ.

787
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,223
-I'm okay.
-Yeah, you look it.

788
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,308
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?

789
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,144
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.

790
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:53,605
I've got him.

791
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:55,941
Get some sleep, Ira.

792
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:23,236
-Mike?
-Yeah?

793
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,405
-Do you see this?
-What?

794
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:27,532
-Mike?
-Oh, shit, go!

795
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,666
He's killing me!

796
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:17,457
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?

797
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:21,294
-What?
-Well, they're not shooting at us.

798
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:23,880
Maybe we killed them all
or they ran off in the night.

799
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,091
Or they're waiting for us
to start climbing.

800
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,885
Third Platoon !
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.

801
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,887
-Just us?
-Yeah, just us, Igg.

802
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,640
All right, Third Platoon, move!

803
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,308
I tag along?

804
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:38,645
You can lead the way, if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.

805
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:41,064
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous,
Hank.

806
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,442
Hey, that'll work for me too.

807
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:50,574
Lieutenant,
if you make it to the top, put this up.

808
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,367
Yes, sir.

809
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:01,251
Don't worry, Iggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.

810
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:03,336
-They don't?
-No.

811
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:05,672
They want us to go up,
signal that it's okay. . .

812
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:08,508
. . .then shoot everybody else
as they come up the mountain.

813
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,343
-Really?
-Yeah.

814
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:14,347
Unless, of course, they want to make an
example of us and discourage the others.

815
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,892
I think you're full of crap,
you know that, Hank?

816
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:18,351
Really?

817
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,229
Jesus.

818
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:24,524
Thank God that ain't us.

819
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:38,371
Told you.

820
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:42,501
Boots, spread them out
and put them on a line.

821
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:45,962
Set up a perimeter! First Squad !

822
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:53,386
-Hank? Find me a pole.
-Yeah.

823
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,472
Right here.

824
01:13:56,808 --> 01:13:59,267
Let's put this flag up.

825
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:06,483
Watch it.

826
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,277
Right over here.

827
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,660
Here, here. That's good.
Right here, right here.

828
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,579
Got that end? Hold that steady.

829
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,957
Lindberg.

830
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,586
-Hey, who's got rope?
-Right here.

831
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:33,009
-Give me something-- Yeah, good.
-That work?

832
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:39,975
Do it, fellas.

833
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:43,603
Keep it coming.

834
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:52,779
USMC! USMC!

835
01:14:53,865 --> 01:14:55,031
-Shit, look!
-Look at that!

836
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,120
Yeah !

837
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:13,967
Yeah ! Yeah !

838
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:31,610
Jeez, look at that.

839
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:41,077
Get down ! Take cover!

840
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:43,246
Cover with that .30!

841
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:47,250
-Watch it! Twenty yards down, Hank!
-You see them?

842
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:51,504
-I got about 20 yards, left side.
-Lindberg, get the flamethrower!

843
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:55,508
Boots, you see them?
Cover right!

844
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:58,094
-About 20 yards down ! Duck one!
-You see them?

845
01:15:58,304 --> 01:15:59,638
Keep the cover on !

846
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:04,309
Second Squad, you see them?
Get me some grenades!

847
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:07,020
I see them !

848
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:20,825
-You see them?
-Right flank, over to the right!

849
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,539
Cover me, I'm going down !

850
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:29,125
Careful, Iggy. Easy.

851
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:32,462
All clear!

852
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:44,683
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?

853
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:47,686
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

854
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:50,563
-Goddamn it. Strank!
-Sir?

855
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:53,316
They want a phone line run up
to the top of the mountain.

856
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,026
Let me guess, they picked us.

857
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:59,114
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.

858
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:07,247
Let's go. Get off your ass.

859
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,544
Oh, shit!

860
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:16,256
Hope it still works,
because you're not getting mine.

861
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:19,009
-Get Forrestal !
-All right.

862
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:24,764
I don't know whose idea it was,
Mr. Secretary.

863
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:27,642
Well, it was goddamned brilliant.

864
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:29,769
I want that flag, Holland.
Mark my words. . .

865
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:35,525
. . . raising that son of a bitch means
a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.

866
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,861
I want that flag.

867
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:43,408
Yes, sir. I'll make sure no one touches it.
You can count on me.

868
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:47,579
Fuck that. That flag belongs
to the men in this battalion.

869
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:50,540
That son of a bitch thinks
our men died taking this ground. . .

870
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:53,626
. . .so we could hand our flag
to some politician to pin to his wall?

871
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:56,129
He's out of his goddamn mind !

872
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:59,299
Get me that flag
and find another one to replace it.

873
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,677
You've gotta be shitting me. Gagnon !

874
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,931
Get your ass over here.

875
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:12,645
-Hey.
-Hey.

876
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,231
-Hey, fellas.
-How you doing?

877
01:18:17,818 --> 01:18:19,527
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.

878
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:23,448
It's that kind of day.

879
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:46,679
-Hey, Mike.
-Hell of a view, lieutenant.

880
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,682
Lieutenant!

881
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:57,816
Captain says he wants that flag.

882
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:01,611
-He wants this flag?
-Yes, sir.

883
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:05,698
-We just put the damn thing up.
-Yes, sir.

884
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:07,367
Some kind of flag shortage?

885
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,828
He wants you to put this one up instead.

886
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,711
Hey, Mike.

887
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:23,675
-Do me a favor. Put this up, will you?
-Yes, sir.

888
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,844
All right, let's find a pole.

889
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:32,725
Take the flag down, boys.
Captain's orders.

890
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:35,728
You heard him, let's do it.

891
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:41,818
-There you go.
-Lordy, she's a heavy one.

892
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:49,742
All right, hang on. Put this on.

893
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:56,207
One hell of a view.

894
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:59,461
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.

895
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:09,888
All right.

896
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:16,352
-Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
-No, I'm fine, thanks.

897
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,272
Hey, Doc,
you wanna give us a hand here?

898
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:25,778
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.

899
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:26,946
Ready? Ready?

900
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:28,490
Let's go.

901
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:33,578
Did you get it?

902
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:40,585
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.

903
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:45,465
Nobody even noticed
that second flag going up.

904
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:51,930
Everybody saw that damn picture
and made up their own story about it.

905
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:57,602
But your dad and the others knew what
they had done and what they had not.

906
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:01,689
All your friends dying. . .

907
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:05,818
. . . it's hard enough to be called a hero
for saving somebody's life.

908
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:09,113
But for putting up a pole?

909
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:14,911
You gotta be kidding.

910
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:20,208
Hey! It took a lot of talented folks
a long time to make that thing.

911
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:24,337
Wait till tonight, when it's lit properly,
there's thousands of cheering people.

912
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:25,838
It's gonna look a lot better.

913
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:29,217
So stadium lights come down,
spotlight comes up, you get your cue.

914
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,970
Charge up this thing with the flag,
plant it at the top.

915
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:34,597
You smile, you wave. You know the drill.

916
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:37,850
You want us to plant the flag on
a pile of papier-mâché.

917
01:21:37,977 --> 01:21:40,853
Hey, that's show biz.

918
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:43,856
And try and stand how you stood
the first time you planted it.

919
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:46,401
You know, pretend
the other three guys are with you.

920
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:47,860
The dead guys.

921
01:21:49,363 --> 01:21:51,281
Yeah, yeah.

922
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:56,160
-Okay, not a problem.
-Good.

923
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,871
But where do we imagine
Hank is standing?

924
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:00,873
Sorry?

925
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:05,420
Seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind
of hard for us to leave a space for him.

926
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:10,425
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.

927
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,887
This is bullshit.

928
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:19,684
I planted that damn thing once
and I'm not doing it again.

929
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,938
-Hayes.
-For chrissake.

930
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:28,067
Hayes. Hayes, get your ass back here
or you're going on report.

931
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:30,069
Hayes!

932
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:33,489
You wanna do your damn job?

933
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:40,913
Let go of me! Let go of me!

934
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:45,043
Come on ! Come on !

935
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:50,089
He's with me! Hey, he's with me!

936
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,718
-Back off!
-Sir, he's with me, okay? He's with me.

937
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:55,386
Ira, put the goddamn chair down !

938
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:58,306
-Put the chair down, son !
-Put the chair down, Ira!

939
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:01,517
Tell them drop their sticks!

940
01:23:01,769 --> 01:23:03,936
They're cops.
They're supposed to have nightsticks.

941
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:06,314
You're not supposed to be
swinging a chair.

942
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:08,650
-Calm down, son.
-Sir, turn around, please.

943
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:11,319
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.

944
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,821
-That's him?
-Yes, sir. Do you read the papers?

945
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:15,114
Oh, Christ.

946
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:18,242
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.

947
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:20,119
-Can you do that?
-Yes, sir.

948
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:25,458
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.

949
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:34,759
Did you start this?

950
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,969
He didn't serve me!

951
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,889
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.

952
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:48,272
He needs to go sleep it off.

953
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:00,493
Soldier Field.

954
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:06,582
You hear that?

955
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:08,376
What the hell is that?

956
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:10,753
I can't figure it out.

957
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,296
Keep an eye out.

958
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:15,299
Hey, it sounds like
it's coming from up there.

959
01:25:24,203 --> 01:25:26,496
They're using grenades.

960
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:29,040
They're killing themselves.

961
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:42,094
Ira, let's go. Come on.

962
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:48,267
Let's go, Ira. Come on.

963
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:13,125
Thank God. Jesus. Look at you, chief.

964
01:26:15,546 --> 01:26:17,255
You found him.

965
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:20,424
Holy shit.
You would have to pick today.

966
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:23,386
Vandegrift is here with
enough brass to start a fucking band.

967
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:26,639
-Come on, let's go. Can you walk?
-Yes, sir.

968
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:30,017
By yourself? All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him.

969
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:33,729
Get him to the top, plant that flag,
and don't fucking fall off.

970
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:38,818
Get him in his stuff. I'll stall these guys
for as long as I can. Hurry up.

971
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:40,319
Jesus Christ.

972
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:46,158
And now the heroes of lwo Jima!

973
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:50,955
Cover!

974
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:56,168
Harlon !

975
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:02,508
Harlon !
Get your fire team up in that position !

976
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:04,552
O'Hare!

977
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:05,928
First Fire Team !

978
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:09,098
Work around !

979
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:11,559
B.A. R. , you, other side of the ridge!

980
01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:18,190
Covering fire, boys. Go, go, go!

981
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:21,193
Jackson, work your team around
to the left!

982
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:23,154
Cover!

983
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:33,497
Left flank! Left flank!

984
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:42,006
Franklin, Gus, go check it out!

985
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:46,802
Hustle up, boys!

986
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:55,227
-We got them !
-Clear!

987
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:13,412
One hell of an experience.

988
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:22,046
Move out!

989
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:32,348
Cease fire! They're my men !
You're targeting our men !

990
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:38,187
You're targeting our--

991
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,691
Get me another radio!

992
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:47,655
Sergeant? Sergeant!

993
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:52,284
Mike! Mike, Mike, Mike!

994
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,789
Mike? Mike!

995
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:03,379
Here.

996
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:05,589
Hey, where's Doc?

997
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:08,843
Corpsman !

998
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:12,263
Oh, shit.

999
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:16,767
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.

1000
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:20,312
Hey, Mike.
Mike, Mike, can you hear us?

1001
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:25,109
It's okay. It's okay.

1002
01:29:26,737 --> 01:29:28,738
Come on, Mike.

1003
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:32,324
Mike? Mike, can you hear us?

1004
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,668
Oh, Jesus.

1005
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:45,504
All right, let's go!

1006
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:48,049
Move out!

1007
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:49,925
We need a hand over here.

1008
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:51,343
I'm gonna get a stretcher.

1009
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:53,929
Let's take him down,
move him off the beach.

1010
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:11,155
Ladies and gentlemen,
the heroes of lwo Jima!

1011
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:14,366
Corpsman!

1012
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:25,169
Hank! Hank!

1013
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:47,399
Doc, they killed me.

1014
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:56,408
Harlon !

1015
01:30:58,411 --> 01:30:59,912
Doc. . .

1016
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:03,666
. . .they killed me.

1017
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:07,586
Come on, Harlon.
Harlon, stay with me.

1018
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:20,432
Franklin !

1019
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:27,898
-Franklin.
-I'm fine, Ira.

1020
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:16,906
Corpsman!

1021
01:32:19,576 --> 01:32:21,493
-Where'd he go?
-Who?

1022
01:32:21,494 --> 01:32:24,205
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?

1023
01:32:24,414 --> 01:32:26,624
-I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
-I didn't.

1024
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:29,418
He was right here.
Now, where the hell is he?

1025
01:32:30,212 --> 01:32:33,464
Iggy! Iggy!

1026
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:36,508
Shut up. You want every Jap
on the island shooting at us?

1027
01:32:36,509 --> 01:32:38,427
Iggy!

1028
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:53,525
Does it open?

1029
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,946
Iggy!

1030
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,531
Iggy!

1031
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:03,327
Iggy, are you down there?

1032
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:06,538
Iggy!

1033
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:10,709
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.

1034
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:13,504
I had to go outside to throw up.

1035
01:33:14,965 --> 01:33:17,549
Look what they did
to the poor son of a bitch.

1036
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,042
You okay, chief?

1037
01:34:33,877 --> 01:34:35,627
Just let it go.

1038
01:34:35,754 --> 01:34:39,298
If that doesn't pry open their wallets,
nothing will.

1039
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:50,642
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.

1040
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:56,648
Goddamn Indians.

1041
01:35:06,743 --> 01:35:09,453
Come on, chief. Let's get you home.

1042
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:22,257
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.

1043
01:35:22,467 --> 01:35:26,261
He's been drunk since he started this
damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.

1044
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:29,431
Just about choked that poor woman
at the reception, blubbering.

1045
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:32,059
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be
watching these men.

1046
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:35,687
-Yes, sir.
-He's making us look like regular asses.

1047
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:38,774
With all due respect,
he never wanted to come on this trip.

1048
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:43,028
Had to pull him, kicking, screaming, off
that boat. He wants to be with his unit.

1049
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:46,240
What unit? They're all fucking dead.

1050
01:35:46,825 --> 01:35:50,077
This is how he honors those men,
by drinking and throwing up and. . .?

1051
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:53,205
You know what? He wants it?
Great, we'll send him back.

1052
01:35:53,415 --> 01:35:57,251
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.

1053
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:00,212
Yes, sir.

1054
01:36:07,137 --> 01:36:08,720
I'll do it.

1055
01:36:27,866 --> 01:36:32,161
Yeah, no, that's, that's good.
That's what I want.

1056
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:35,747
I know it's a good thing. . .

1057
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:40,544
. . . raising the money and that,
because we need it.

1058
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:47,176
But I can't take them calling me a hero.

1059
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:52,347
All I did was try not to get shot.

1060
01:36:57,061 --> 01:37:02,316
Some of the things I saw done,
things I did. . .

1061
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:06,945
. . .they weren't things to be proud of,
you know?

1062
01:37:16,956 --> 01:37:18,749
Mike.

1063
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:25,756
Mike was a hero.

1064
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:29,801
You ever meet him?

1065
01:37:31,804 --> 01:37:32,971
No.

1066
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:41,813
Best Marine I ever met.

1067
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:50,948
You know, chief, I think
if Mike was sitting here instead of you. . .

1068
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:53,408
. . . he'd be saying the same thing
about himself. . .

1069
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:57,704
. . . not being a hero.

1070
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:06,547
Maybe.

1071
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,760
He was a good guy.

1072
01:38:11,844 --> 01:38:16,139
But I think that he would
be ashamed of me. . .

1073
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:18,809
. . .seeing me the way I am.

1074
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:42,874
Think I could see my ma
before they ship me off?

1075
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:46,253
Think they'd do that? See my ma?

1076
01:38:50,883 --> 01:38:52,217
I'm sorry, Ira.

1077
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:07,566
We got stories now to tell our kids,
I guess.

1078
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:09,776
Keep your head down.

1079
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:20,078
All aboard.

1080
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:22,497
Good luck, chief.

1081
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:56,448
Think I saw him once after that.

1082
01:39:56,658 --> 01:39:59,618
It was maybe six or seven years
after the war.

1083
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:02,704
I was working as a salesman,
doing a lot of driving.

1084
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:04,456
I was driving west across Texas.

1085
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:07,250
I was trying to get where
I was going so I could get home.

1086
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:10,629
And I saw this guy hitchhiking
on the side of the road.

1087
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:14,091
And for a second,
l thought it might've been him.

1088
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:21,973
l'll always regret that I didn't stop,
but I was in a hurry.

1089
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:24,976
And he was an Indian.

1090
01:40:25,144 --> 01:40:29,981
We always told the press Ira insisted that
he was going back to fight with his unit. . .

1091
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:32,776
. . .which was at least partially true. . .

1092
01:40:32,985 --> 01:40:37,989
. . . but that isn't what got the headlines.

1093
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:40,992
We're engaged.

1094
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:46,540
Excuse me a minute, darling.

1095
01:40:46,749 --> 01:40:48,875
-Hey, Doc?
-Yeah?

1096
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:50,335
Got a minute?

1097
01:40:50,545 --> 01:40:53,004
-Yeah.
-I'll see you at the car.

1098
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:58,009
-You hear I'm getting married?
-I did, Rene. That's great.

1099
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:04,182
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.

1100
01:41:04,434 --> 01:41:07,394
She's not used to all this,
but she's a good girl.

1101
01:41:07,645 --> 01:41:09,980
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

1102
01:41:10,022 --> 01:41:12,816
So I was wondering if
you'd be my best man.

1103
01:41:13,025 --> 01:41:14,818
Me?

1104
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:21,032
Don't you have somebody at home,
a buddy you'd rather ask?

1105
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,368
Well, I didn't really make many.

1106
01:41:23,578 --> 01:41:27,164
The ones who didn't go, it's,
well, it's hard to even talk to them.

1107
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:31,042
-You know.
-Yeah, I know.

1108
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:35,839
I'd be proud to.

1109
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:38,049
Thank you.

1110
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:41,052
I better go drag her away from them. . .

1111
01:41:41,053 --> 01:41:45,015
. . . before she announces I'm gonna be
president of General Motors or something.

1112
01:41:46,058 --> 01:41:47,559
All right.

1113
01:41:47,769 --> 01:41:50,604
-Congratulations, honey.
-Thank you so much. Thank you.

1114
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:52,314
Rene, you're a lucky man.

1115
01:41:55,067 --> 01:41:56,651
-Here they are now.
-Here they come.

1116
01:41:56,861 --> 01:41:58,779
Grab a shot of them on the steps.

1117
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:05,827
-Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon !
-Say cheese.

1118
01:42:06,037 --> 01:42:08,663
l couldn't complain,
because the press loved them...

1119
01:42:08,873 --> 01:42:12,542
...so they wrote more articles
and people bought more bonds.

1120
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:19,591
The tour went on with just
Rene and your dad.

1121
01:42:23,513 --> 01:42:25,096
And the true heroes are the men. . .

1122
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:27,641
. . .who didn't make it home
from Iwo Jima. . .

1123
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:31,978
. . .the men who died at Iwo Jima
and in other campaigns.

1124
01:42:32,104 --> 01:42:34,898
We ask that you honor
the memory of those men. . .

1125
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:38,485
. . . by buying the war bonds
and helping us to win this war.

1126
01:42:38,694 --> 01:42:40,111
Thank you.

1127
01:42:44,116 --> 01:42:48,078
City after city, I thought the damn thing
would never end.

1128
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:53,250
And this rumor kept going around
that the photograph had been staged.

1129
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:58,171
Your dad said he wished he'd known
he was having his picture taken...

1130
01:42:58,381 --> 01:43:00,674
. . .because he would've ducked
the hell out of it.

1131
01:43:00,883 --> 01:43:05,011
Was this your idea? Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?

1132
01:43:05,137 --> 01:43:08,139
Was there truth to the rumor
that that picture was staged, Doc?

1133
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:11,184
-Come on ! Doc?
-Can you answer that?

1134
01:43:12,937 --> 01:43:17,148
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.

1135
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:20,735
People back home saw that picture. . .

1136
01:43:20,945 --> 01:43:24,155
. . .and thought it was over
when we took Suribachi.

1137
01:43:24,949 --> 01:43:26,658
We wished.

1138
01:43:27,159 --> 01:43:33,331
Anyways, we're pinned down.
Mortars, shells, machine guns.

1139
01:43:33,583 --> 01:43:36,334
Fire coming from every which direction,
right?

1140
01:43:37,253 --> 01:43:41,631
And we hear somebody call,
"Corpsman down."

1141
01:43:42,675 --> 01:43:45,176
Corpsman down !

1142
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:55,186
Blood was spurting out of his throat
and Doc was doing everything he could.

1143
01:43:57,189 --> 01:44:00,775
And the corpsman looks up at him...

1144
01:44:00,985 --> 01:44:04,195
...and he knows what this means,
shot in the neck.

1145
01:44:05,197 --> 01:44:08,199
He knows he's dying, you can see that.

1146
01:44:08,367 --> 01:44:12,203
But still, in his eyes...

1147
01:44:12,204 --> 01:44:15,373
...he's pleading with Doc to save his life.

1148
01:44:21,756 --> 01:44:24,090
And Doc can't.

1149
01:45:01,253 --> 01:45:04,631
-You okay, Doc?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1150
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:08,343
-Yeah, you look fine.
-I'm okay.

1151
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:11,596
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.

1152
01:45:11,806 --> 01:45:13,306
Okay.

1153
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:21,314
Corpsman.

1154
01:45:21,524 --> 01:45:23,274
Corpsman !

1155
01:45:24,527 --> 01:45:26,403
For God's sake, corpsman.

1156
01:45:45,297 --> 01:45:47,090
Corpsman?

1157
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:50,593
Corpsman.

1158
01:45:52,263 --> 01:45:54,889
Incoming !

1159
01:45:57,893 --> 01:45:59,561
Let me see.

1160
01:46:02,398 --> 01:46:05,316
It's not that bad, you're gonna be okay.
All right?

1161
01:46:05,317 --> 01:46:07,360
Just stay with me. Look at me.

1162
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:11,865
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.

1163
01:46:12,074 --> 01:46:13,742
Coming down.

1164
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:19,330
We got a chest wound.
Put pressure on it.

1165
01:46:20,332 --> 01:46:22,000
Thanks.

1166
01:46:26,047 --> 01:46:30,467
Vets will tell you about being hit
but not wanting to leave their buddies.

1167
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:33,344
Usually, they're lying.

1168
01:46:33,596 --> 01:46:36,639
You'll take any excuse
to get out of there.

1169
01:46:37,516 --> 01:46:39,601
But it happens.

1170
01:46:41,353 --> 01:46:44,355
You get the feeling
you're letting them down.

1171
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:48,359
I could see that in your dad's face.

1172
01:46:49,361 --> 01:46:51,488
Oh, he wanted to go.

1173
01:46:51,906 --> 01:46:53,865
He'd seen enough.

1174
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:56,951
But he didn't want to leave us.

1175
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:01,164
Now, he was a hell of a good man,
your dad.

1176
01:47:04,794 --> 01:47:06,252
Yeah.

1177
01:47:06,378 --> 01:47:08,379
While we were sitting there
on the beach. . .

1178
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:10,381
...we heard this great roar.

1179
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:11,800
And we looked up....

1180
01:47:17,681 --> 01:47:21,059
That was the first of
thousands of landings on lwo.

1181
01:47:21,268 --> 01:47:23,394
-Look at that.
-Yeah.

1182
01:47:23,813 --> 01:47:25,438
How about that.

1183
01:47:31,403 --> 01:47:32,904
I'm gonna head back, all right?

1184
01:47:33,114 --> 01:47:34,405
Good luck.

1185
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:40,411
That island saved a lot of lives.

1186
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:45,583
A lot of lives.

1187
01:47:49,505 --> 01:47:51,881
l don't know what else to tell you.

1188
01:48:00,558 --> 01:48:04,435
After the bond tour,
my dad finally got his operation.

1189
01:48:15,614 --> 01:48:18,575
By the time he got home,
the war was over.

1190
01:48:22,872 --> 01:48:25,874
First thing he did
was ask my mom to marry him.

1191
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:32,755
lra tried to get on with his life
and put it all behind him.

1192
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:37,552
Like to thank you
for having me here today.

1193
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:43,892
It's an honor to be in front
of such a strong people.

1194
01:48:46,478 --> 01:48:48,605
Because of the war. . .

1195
01:48:49,773 --> 01:48:53,943
. . .white men will understand Indians
a lot better.

1196
01:48:56,488 --> 01:48:59,949
And it's going to be a better world.

1197
01:49:19,261 --> 01:49:21,763
But life had other plans for him.

1198
01:49:35,444 --> 01:49:37,695
You're-- You're him, aren't you?

1199
01:49:37,947 --> 01:49:39,864
You're the hero, right?

1200
01:49:43,535 --> 01:49:46,663
Great. All right, kids,
go get your picture taken.

1201
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:51,000
Oh, that's great. That's great.

1202
01:49:51,335 --> 01:49:52,710
All right, now say cheese.

1203
01:49:52,962 --> 01:49:54,295
-Cheese.
-Cheese.

1204
01:49:54,797 --> 01:49:58,549
That's great. Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot. Thanks.

1205
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:01,844
-Come on.
-That's a hero, kids.

1206
01:50:10,354 --> 01:50:15,566
Hey, hero, lift this basket, will you?

1207
01:50:15,651 --> 01:50:17,735
It's too heavy for me.

1208
01:50:42,303 --> 01:50:45,680
Rene tried to take advantage of those
offers he'd received on the bond tour.

1209
01:50:45,889 --> 01:50:50,518
Yes, G-A-G-N-O-N.

1210
01:50:50,602 --> 01:50:52,937
Right. Pronounced "Rene."

1211
01:50:53,147 --> 01:50:54,480
Rene, yes.

1212
01:50:55,107 --> 01:50:56,607
l actually called last week.

1213
01:50:56,775 --> 01:50:59,861
Yes. Okay, yes. Mr. Gagnon.

1214
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:02,613
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.

1215
01:51:02,614 --> 01:51:04,407
I'm sure he'll call you.

1216
01:51:04,658 --> 01:51:05,992
Okay.

1217
01:51:06,201 --> 01:51:07,618
All right. . .

1218
01:51:08,037 --> 01:51:09,537
. . .thank you.

1219
01:51:09,621 --> 01:51:11,622
But he was yesterday's hero.

1220
01:51:11,790 --> 01:51:15,585
He even applied for a job
at the local police station.

1221
01:51:17,421 --> 01:51:19,630
They said he wasn't qualified.

1222
01:51:19,798 --> 01:51:22,675
After working the factory with Pauline
he tried a few things...

1223
01:51:22,885 --> 01:51:25,720
...but spent the rest of his life
as a janitor.

1224
01:51:27,973 --> 01:51:29,015
But lra. . . .

1225
01:51:29,224 --> 01:51:32,060
Ira. You got a visitor.

1226
01:51:34,897 --> 01:51:36,814
lra always made the news.

1227
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:47,992
l could never find out why he did it,
but one day lra just took off.

1228
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:34,247
He walked and hitched
over 1300 miles. . .

1229
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:37,125
. . .from Arizona to Texas.

1230
01:52:39,837 --> 01:52:43,089
He found Harlon Block's father
working his field.

1231
01:52:43,298 --> 01:52:47,885
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after
they discovered Harlon died.

1232
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:52,056
She never forgave him
for letting her son go off to war.

1233
01:53:10,033 --> 01:53:12,493
And lra told him the truth.

1234
01:53:13,328 --> 01:53:16,789
That it had been his son
who raised the flag with them...

1235
01:53:17,332 --> 01:53:19,750
...his son in the photograph.

1236
01:53:22,004 --> 01:53:24,755
And then he just turned
and walked away.

1237
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:29,427
Though the flag-raising
meant nothing to him...

1238
01:53:29,678 --> 01:53:32,930
. . .he somehow knew
it would mean everything to them.

1239
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:50,781
Thanks for calling.

1240
01:53:54,786 --> 01:53:57,371
Just as Belle knew all along.

1241
01:54:06,381 --> 01:54:07,924
The press soon found out...

1242
01:54:08,217 --> 01:54:12,595
. . .and called Hank's mom with the news
that it wasn't her son after all.

1243
01:54:25,609 --> 01:54:27,401
The last time they all saw each other...

1244
01:54:27,611 --> 01:54:30,821
...was at the unveiling of
the Marine Corps War Memorial.

1245
01:54:32,115 --> 01:54:35,409
And even though he'd planted
the first flag above lwo Jima...

1246
01:54:35,827 --> 01:54:38,079
. . .Hank's mother and father
weren't invited.

1247
01:55:15,867 --> 01:55:17,118
Ira.

1248
01:55:29,673 --> 01:55:31,674
It's good to see you, Ira.

1249
01:55:39,891 --> 01:55:41,892
Hell of a statue.

1250
01:55:54,823 --> 01:55:57,950
lt wasn't long after that
that they found lra.

1251
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:00,911
The papers said he died of exposure.

1252
01:56:00,912 --> 01:56:03,414
There was no autopsy.

1253
01:56:17,346 --> 01:56:21,057
lt was about that same time my father
got in his car early one morning...

1254
01:56:21,266 --> 01:56:23,976
...telling my mom
he had something to do.

1255
01:56:30,692 --> 01:56:35,196
He drove to a town on the other side
of Wisconsin, where lggy's mom lived.

1256
01:56:44,956 --> 01:56:47,083
Ever since she heard the news
about her son. . .

1257
01:56:47,292 --> 01:56:51,962
...she'd been trying to find out how
he died, and no one would tell her.

1258
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:55,633
l never found out what he told her. . .

1259
01:56:56,134 --> 01:56:59,720
...but I can pretty much guarantee
it wasn't the truth.

1260
01:57:00,972 --> 01:57:03,307
My mother would ask him
what was troubling him.

1261
01:57:03,517 --> 01:57:05,518
He would never say.

1262
01:57:12,943 --> 01:57:15,778
And every year,
as it got close to Memorial Day...

1263
01:57:15,987 --> 01:57:19,990
...the reporters would start calling,
asking to interview my father.

1264
01:57:20,951 --> 01:57:23,994
No, I'm sorry, he's fishing in Canada.

1265
01:57:24,579 --> 01:57:26,789
We were always instructed
to say the same thing.

1266
01:57:26,998 --> 01:57:27,998
Okay.

1267
01:57:28,083 --> 01:57:29,709
Thanks.

1268
01:57:32,170 --> 01:57:34,004
When Mr. McCandless retired...

1269
01:57:34,172 --> 01:57:37,967
...my father bought the funeral home
where he'd worked since coming home.

1270
01:57:38,009 --> 01:57:42,430
He spent the rest of his life
running the business and raising his family.

1271
01:58:30,228 --> 01:58:33,439
He never spoke about the war
or about the flag-raising.

1272
01:58:34,149 --> 01:58:36,358
Never told us anything.

1273
01:58:36,568 --> 01:58:40,613
The first time I heard
any of these stories was after he died.

1274
01:58:57,255 --> 01:58:59,089
Where is he?

1275
01:58:59,090 --> 01:59:01,133
Oh, God.

1276
01:59:02,511 --> 01:59:04,553
He's not here, Dad.

1277
01:59:05,096 --> 01:59:06,096
He died.

1278
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:11,101
Who? Who died?

1279
01:59:11,561 --> 01:59:13,062
Iggy.

1280
01:59:14,689 --> 01:59:16,273
Iggy.

1281
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:21,570
Christ, poor Iggy.

1282
01:59:21,905 --> 01:59:24,824
I hadn't thought of him for years.

1283
01:59:26,117 --> 01:59:28,577
How do you know about Iggy?

1284
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:31,205
You were calling for him.

1285
01:59:31,665 --> 01:59:33,290
When you collapsed.

1286
01:59:37,712 --> 01:59:40,923
I wasn't looking for Iggy.

1287
01:59:42,133 --> 01:59:44,301
I was looking for you.

1288
01:59:46,137 --> 01:59:48,138
I wanted to. . . .

1289
01:59:50,308 --> 01:59:55,020
I wanted to tell you, I'm--
I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.

1290
01:59:56,147 --> 01:59:58,440
Talked to you more.

1291
01:59:59,276 --> 02:00:00,609
I just. . . .

1292
02:00:04,406 --> 02:00:06,323
I'm sorry.

1293
02:00:08,243 --> 02:00:09,827
Sorry?

1294
02:00:11,413 --> 02:00:14,331
You were the best father
a man could have.

1295
02:00:24,301 --> 02:00:28,846
Did I ever tell you
they took us swimming?

1296
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:33,976
No, Dad.

1297
02:00:35,353 --> 02:00:40,858
After we planted the flag,
we came down off the mountain. . .

1298
02:00:41,192 --> 02:00:43,360
. . .and they let us swim.

1299
02:00:44,362 --> 02:00:47,197
It was the funniest thing.

1300
02:00:47,949 --> 02:00:50,200
All this fighting and--

1301
02:00:50,493 --> 02:00:54,246
And we were jumping around
in the water like kids.

1302
02:00:57,792 --> 02:01:01,921
That's the way I remember Iggy now.

1303
02:01:37,332 --> 02:01:41,126
l finally came to the conclusion
that maybe he was right.

1304
02:01:41,252 --> 02:01:44,254
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.

1305
02:01:44,422 --> 02:01:47,257
Maybe there are just people like my dad.

1306
02:01:48,301 --> 02:01:51,387
l finally came to understand why they
were so uncomfortable. . .

1307
02:01:51,596 --> 02:01:53,931
...being called heroes.

1308
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:58,394
Heroes are something we create,
something we need.

1309
02:02:02,273 --> 02:02:06,443
lt's a way for us to understand
what is almost incomprehensible...

1310
02:02:06,695 --> 02:02:10,280
...how people could sacrifice
so much for us.

1311
02:02:10,281 --> 02:02:12,533
But for my dad and these men. . .

1312
02:02:12,742 --> 02:02:15,661
...the risks they took,
the wounds they suffered...

1313
02:02:16,287 --> 02:02:18,539
...they did that for their buddies.

1314
02:02:18,790 --> 02:02:22,334
They may have fought for their country,
but they died for their friends.

1315
02:02:22,544 --> 02:02:26,296
For the man in front,
for the man beside them.

1316
02:02:26,798 --> 02:02:29,800
And if we wish to truly
honor these men. . .

1317
02:02:30,010 --> 02:02:32,845
. . .we should remember them
the way they really were...

1318
02:02:33,054 --> 02:02:35,305
...the way my dad remembered them.

1319
02:03:15,388 --> 02:03:16,388
Come on, Doc!
