2
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,940
<i>My husband used to tell me</i>

3
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,640
<i>I have an overactive
imagination.</i>

4
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,840
<i>I can't help it.</i>

5
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,120
<i>I mean, haven't you ever been</i>

6
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,710
<i>on a train and wondered
about the lives</i>

7
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,440
<i>of the people
who live near the tracks?</i>

8
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,360
<i>The lives you've never lived.</i>

9
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,200
<i>These are things I want to know.</i>

10
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,830
<i>Twice a day, I sit in
the third car from the front</i>

11
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,490
<i>where I have the perfect view
into my favorite house.</i>

12
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,130
<i>Number 15 Beckett road.</i>

13
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,510
<i>I don't know when exactly.</i>

14
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,810
<i>I suppose I started
noticing her about a year ago,</i>

15
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,320
<i>and gradually,
as the months went past,</i>

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,160
<i>she became important to me.</i>

17
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,140
<i>I'm not the girl I used to be.</i>

18
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,670
<i>I think people can see it
on my face.</i>

19
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
<i>She's what I lost.</i>

20
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,330
<i>She's everything I want to be.</i>

21
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,570
<i>I imagine she's a painter.</i>

22
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,080
<i>She's creative.</i>

23
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,750
<i>He's a doctor or an architect.</i>

24
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,075
<i>He has a good laugh.</i>

25
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:34,360
<i>She can't cook.</i>

26
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,260
<i>I wonder what they say
to each other</i>

27
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,760
<i>before they go to sleep.</i>

28
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,680
<i>Today her name is Jess;
Tomorrow it could be...</i>

29
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,580
<i>Lisa or Amber.</i>

30
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,780
<i>It all depends on the day;
It depends on my mood.</i>

31
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,450
<i>The truth is,
I don't know her name.</i>

32
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,760
<i>I don't know if she paints or
whether he has a good laugh.</i>

33
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,930
<i>I just know they know love.</i>

34
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,700
<i>Sometimes I catch myself
trying to remember</i>

35
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,400
<i>the last time I had meaningful
contact with another person.</i>

36
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,680
<i>I used to live two doors down,
number 13 Beckett road.</i>

37
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,405
<i>- No.
- It was my first home.</i>

38
00:04:38,605 --> 00:04:41,120
<i>We bought it together.</i>

39
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,050
<i>- It was ours.
- You didn't even like having him over.</i>

40
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,660
I hated it.

41
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,190
<i>Every day,
I tell myself not to look.</i>

42
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,240
<i>But then I look.</i>

43
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,070
<i>Are you alone?</i>

44
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,380
Yeah.

45
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,480
No, it's...
Come. It's all yours.

46
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,185
- Okay.
- Your baby's so cute.

47
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:14,680
- Oh, thank you.
- Hi, baby!

48
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,190
Is it a... is it a boy?

49
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,620
Yeah!

50
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,060
So sweet.
How ol... how old is he?

51
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,020
- Six months.
- Six months.

52
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,110
So sweet.

53
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,245
Shh.

54
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:37,480
Here.

55
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,410
<i>A teacher once told me I was</i>

56
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,440
<i>a mistress
of self-reinvention.</i>

57
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,080
Down the center line,

58
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,450
open, around and together...

59
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,250
<i>I wasn't really sure
what it meant at the time.</i>

60
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,180
Around and up.

61
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,590
<i>But since moving here,</i>

62
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,320
<i>I've come to understand it.</i>

63
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,590
<i>Ardsley-on-Hudson
is boring and routine.</i>

64
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,010
<i>It's a fucking baby factory.</i>

65
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,910
<i>I want to start my life
over again.</i>

66
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,570
<i>So far, I've been
a rebellious teenager...</i>

67
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,150
<i>lover...</i>

68
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,280
<i>Waitress...</i>

69
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,905
<i>Gallery director...</i>

70
00:06:54,105 --> 00:06:56,720
<i>Nanny...</i>

71
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,690
<i>and...</i>

72
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,200
<i>A whore.</i>

73
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,470
<i>And not necessarily
in that order.</i>

74
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,170
<i>I can't just be a wife anymore.</i>

75
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,980
<i>That's why I...</i>

76
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,710
<i>Stay awake at night
staring at the ceiling.</i>

77
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,380
In fact, the only time
I feel like myself

78
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,460
is when I'm running.

79
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,830
You always felt that way?

80
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,420
Maybe since I was...

81
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,690
- About 17.
- Mm-hmm.

82
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,830
With Mac.

83
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,370
Mac? Who's Mac?

84
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,500
My brother's best friend.

85
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,480
My brother who died.

86
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,350
I tend to smile
when I'm nervous.

87
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,330
Sometimes I laugh.

88
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,670
For a year, Mac and I lived
in this hunting cabin.

89
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,270
We started fucking.

90
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,150
We were the saddest people
we knew.

91
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,730
But in a way,
that cabin made us happy.

92
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,050
No one could find us.

93
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,960
Everyone thought we were dead.

94
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,460
And if you were
to run away today,

95
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,100
right now, where would you go?

96
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,550
I read once that
when a train hits,

97
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,690
it can rip the clothes
right off of you.

98
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,230
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks

99
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,030
the nanny job is gonna
make me less restless.

100
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,930
Make me want to get pregnant.

101
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,730
And that's not the case?

102
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,330
When I finish work every night,

103
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,140
I run home
and I get in the shower

104
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,700
and I wash the smell
of that baby off of me

105
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,710
as fast as I can.

106
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,480
Ah.

107
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,490
When you woke up this morning,

108
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,390
I went and I brought you
back to bed with me.

109
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,970
And when I was feeding you,

110
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,230
we heard daddy singing
from the kitchen, didn't we?

111
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,720
Aw, daddy came upstairs
with a beautiful breakfast

112
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,990
that he made for mommy,
didn't he?

113
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,690
Yes, he did.

114
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,390
Thank you, Megan.

115
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,820
Oh.

116
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,490
Whew... ah...

117
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,690
- There.
- There you go.

118
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,030
Come here.

119
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,230
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Oh.

120
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh, hello.

121
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,950
I swear, I sometimes feel like
my heart is gonna explode.

122
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,510
I mean, look at her.

123
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,120
Look at her.

124
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,750
You're not sleeping.

125
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,120
- Hello?
- You're not sleeping.

126
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,195
Hello?

127
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:53,460
Hello?

128
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,390
- Is that another hang-up?
- Mm-hmm.

129
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,360
<i>And grab the corners.</i>

130
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,810
Mm.

131
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,380
And straight.

132
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,640
I got another job.

133
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,050
You what?

134
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,850
I'm really sorry, Anna.

135
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,260
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.

136
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,790
I am.

137
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,960
It's just, this isn't what I do.

138
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,260
Take care of children?

139
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,320
Or laundry.

140
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,240
Another gallery headhunted me.

141
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,470
That's great.

142
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,830
The thing is,
it starts tomorrow.

143
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,710
I'm out all day tomorrow.

144
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,470
- That is so uncool.
- I hate to leave you like this

145
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,480
without child care, but...
You don't have a job.

146
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,560
Okay, that sounded wrong.

147
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,660
I know that
you're busy volunteering.

148
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,540
It's not the volunteering.

149
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,420
It's all the shopping,

150
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,870
it's spending hours
in the farmers' market...

151
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,490
It's finding
the right foods for her,

152
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,740
it's pureeing sweet potatoes,

153
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,430
and I do all of this
at the same time...

154
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,070
As I'm nursing.

155
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,970
Maybe you should go
back to work, too.

156
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,370
Mothers need to work.

157
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,020
It's actually better
for the kid.

158
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,610
And how would you know?

159
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,680
Your key.

160
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,690
There's no job more important
than raising a child.

161
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,970
Megan, please. I...

162
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,060
Rachel.
What are you doing?

163
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,160
Give me my baby.

164
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,560
Rachel, what are you doing?

165
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,700
Hello?

166
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,440
Oh.

167
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,180
- Thank you.
- Here.

168
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,820
Mm. Beautiful.

169
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,520
How many times
has she texted you today?

170
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,520
I don't know.

171
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,750
She called the landline
three times.

172
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,360
Oh.

173
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,600
- You have to talk to her.
- I know. I-I...

174
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,920
It's getting crazy.

175
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,360
I will. I know, I know, I know.

176
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,990
- Okay.
- It's gonna be fine.

177
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,960
Isn't it always fine?

178
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,970
Don't I always make
everything fine?

179
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,100
Stop.

180
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,680
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.

181
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,310
Are you sure you don't want me
to take you out tonight?

182
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,040
- No, I like it at home.
- Call Megan.

183
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,020
Ask her to come back.

184
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,880
She just quit.

185
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,090
She what?

186
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,130
She just told me
she got another job.

187
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,120
Oh.

188
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,670
Shame. Thought you guys were
kind of a good team together.

189
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,560
Mm.

190
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,230
So did I.

191
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
Hey, it's tom.
Sorry I missed you.

192
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,560
I'll get right back to you.

193
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,490
Hey, tom.
It's me.

194
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Uh, I just wanted
to wish mama a happy birthday.

195
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,100
- Happy birthday, mama.
- Rachel.

196
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,430
Jesus.

197
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,640
No, no, no, no, no.

198
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,500
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.

199
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,850
- Relax. Relax!
- Cathy, come on!

200
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,070
I just... I just need some
to go to sleep.

201
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,440
That's all.
I just need... I just...

202
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,350
I just need a little bit
to go to sleep.

203
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,820
What brought this on?

204
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,180
He posted another picture
of the baby.

205
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,050
- It was a cute picture.
- Yeah?

206
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,560
Yup.

207
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,960
Facebook and drunk ex-wives
do not make good friends.

208
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,500
I got it. I got it.

209
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,100
All right.
Let's get you to your room.

210
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,050
Rachel, you have to stop
calling them, okay?

211
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,580
I really appreciate this room.

212
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,550
I do.

213
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,480
I thought that
I would just be here for...

214
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,120
For a couple of weeks or months.

215
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,830
Yeah, that was two years ago.

216
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,240
Get some sleep.

217
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,160
I've rarely works
the first time.

218
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,910
Would you like a moment?

219
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
<i>It's okay, sweetie.</i>

220
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,140
We're gonna try again.

221
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,740
We can't afford to do it again.

222
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,780
Well, when we can, we will.

223
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,210
<i>I wonder what she's looking at.</i>

224
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,160
<i>Or if she even sees
this train at all.</i>

225
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,610
<i>Who is that man?</i>

226
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,610
The next station is
Ardsley-on-Hudson.

227
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,620
<i>What is she doing?</i>

228
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,750
<i>She's throwing it all away.</i>

229
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,510
<i>Anna, I fell asleep last night</i>

230
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,940
<i>thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing</i>

231
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,320
<i>the inside of your thighs
and holding your breasts.</i>

232
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,340
<i>God, I wish</i>

233
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,280
<i>I was fucking you right now.</i>

234
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,650
<i>Anna, I love you.</i>

235
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,620
<i>I love you so much.</i>

236
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,850
<i>When it happened to me,</i>

237
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,290
<i>I found dozens of e-mails.</i>

238
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,895
<i>Tom told her that he never
felt like this before.</i>

239
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:58,690
<i>He said it wouldn't be
that much longer</i>

240
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,900
<i>until they were together.</i>

241
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,200
I know what they say,

242
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,640
and you shouldn't
check his e-mail.

243
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,070
It was stupid.

244
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,980
But when I, um...

245
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,595
When I saw
it was from the realtor,

246
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:17,210
I thought that it was just spam.

247
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,430
And then I realized that
they were kisses, not X's,

248
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,150
and my husband was fucking
a century 21 agent.

249
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,790
That sucks.

250
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,060
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd,

251
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,320
and he was in love with her.

252
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,660
Come here for one second.

253
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,730
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd,"
but just yell it, all right?

254
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,380
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

255
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,540
That bitch is living
in my house.

256
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,150
I picked everything
in that house.

257
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,750
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table,

258
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,550
the kitchen table.

259
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,950
I wonder if she knows
that I fucked tom

260
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,360
on the same table
that her baby eats at.

261
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,300
I just want to tell her.

262
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,160
Oh, I wish I could tell her.

263
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,830
I picked everything
in that house.

264
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,860
I fucking picked
everything in that house.

265
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,780
I...

266
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,250
I could never find the words
to describe how I felt

267
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,480
when I read that e-mail.

268
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,710
But this morning, I did.

269
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,590
I did.

270
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,060
When I saw that woman...

271
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,975
Kissing someone else, just...

272
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:33,890
I... betraying her husband,

273
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,060
I felt... I felt it.

274
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,340
I felt pure rage.

275
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,140
It was like something
had been taken from me again,

276
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,525
and... just thought
if I could...

277
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:52,910
If I could,
I'd just go to her house

278
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,480
and I'd go and...

279
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,480
Find her sitting
at the kitchen table,

280
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,750
and I'd just...

281
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,580
I'd wrap my hand
in her long blond hair,

282
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,980
and I'd jerk her head back.

283
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,950
I'd just jerk it back.

284
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,160
And then I'd pull it down
to the ground,

285
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,590
and I would just...
Smash her head

286
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,410
all over the floor!

287
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,020
Move! Get out of my way!

288
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,700
Move! Move.

289
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,350
Hey!

290
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,610
Hey!

291
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,390
You whore!

292
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,330
Jesus Christ, Rachel.

293
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,360
Uh, what the hell
is wrong with you?

294
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,900
I spent the past hour
driving around looking for you.

295
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,950
You... you scared
the shit out of Anna.

296
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,440
Do you know that?

297
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,510
She thought you were gonna...

298
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,120
She-she wanted to call
the police, so just...

299
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,260
Leave us alone.

300
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,500
You can ruin your own life
if you want to,

301
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,560
but you're not
gonna destroy ours.

302
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,620
I'm not gonna
protect you anymore.

303
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,130
Oh, my god.

304
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,110
God.

305
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,800
God.

306
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,520
Rachel?

307
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,790
Open the door.

308
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,720
Cathy, I just...
I just need a sec.

309
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,530
Are you okay?

310
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:04,090
Rachel, open the door.

311
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,470
I have a stomach flu.

312
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,510
- Okay? I just...
- You don't have a flu.

313
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,930
What the fuck, Rachel?

314
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,210
I'm not stupid!

315
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,970
Rachel!

316
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,570
Cathy, just go away!

317
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,450
Come here for one second.

318
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,350
Just one second.

319
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,660
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."

320
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,300
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

321
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,200
You whore!

322
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,750
No!

323
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,830
<i>Anyone counting days one to 90,</i>

324
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,295
who would like
to share a day count?

325
00:28:47,495 --> 00:28:49,760
Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.

326
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,530
- Welcome, Jason.
- I've got 22 days back.

327
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,340
Nice.

328
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,540
- There we go.
- Good job.

329
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,310
Anyone else?

330
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,810
Hi. I'm-I'm Rachel and...

331
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,280
Welcome, Rachel.

332
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,130
- Hi, Rachel.
- And this... thank you.

333
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,520
This is day one, I-I suppose.

334
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,440
Um...

335
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,100
I'm here because I...

336
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,320
because I...

337
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,160
Because I woke up,
um, covered in blood.

338
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,600
And I had... I had bruises
all over my arm and, um...

339
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,930
It's usually from
when I've fallen

340
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,930
and someone's helped me up.

341
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,970
My husband...

342
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,470
He used to tell me
what I'd done the night before.

343
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
And I learned,
when you wake up like that,

344
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,580
you just say you're sorry.

345
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,110
You just say you're sorry
for what you did

346
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,250
and you're sorry
for who you are,

347
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,790
and you're never
gonna do it again.

348
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,150
But you do. You do it again.

349
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,930
And there's some time missing.

350
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,930
I need to remember.

351
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,270
I need to remember.

352
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,600
Okay.

353
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,310
Thank you, Rachel.

354
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,040
Am I... am I right?

355
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,380
- Or am I nuts?
- No.

356
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,920
Make an effort!
You know, we all worked hard.

357
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,080
That was a charity event.

358
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,450
- You don't wear that.
- No, you don't.

359
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,430
Right? It was that,
um, the homeless thing.

360
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,670
I don't remember
what it was called.

361
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,090
Oh, oh, safe shelter.

362
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,430
Yeah.
That was a tube top, right?

363
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,630
Yup. It was.

364
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,740
I can't.

365
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,900
Why say, "yes, I'm gonna go,

366
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,210
"and I can't wait because

367
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,240
it's fun to dress up."
Then dress up.

368
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,740
<i>Do you like
devil's eggs, Martha?</i>

369
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,770
Deviled eggs? Yeah, I do.

370
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,080
- Deviled egg.
- Thank you for making them.

371
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,650
The classics. Do you want
to try one, anybody?

372
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,310
Uh, those go outside. I don't
want the eggs with the dessert.

373
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,035
It doesn't fucking matter
where they go, okay?

374
00:31:21,235 --> 00:31:22,950
So do you want to put them
here? Do you want them

375
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,360
with your hot dogs
or you can put a couple

376
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,930
with your quinoa if you want to.

377
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,030
Do you want to put them with
your other salad and your corn?

378
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,700
- Rachel.
- Put a couple on the wall?

379
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,730
Rachel.

380
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,230
I'm fine, tom!

381
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,030
- Stop it.
- Come on.

382
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,870
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.

383
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,500
You never have my back.

384
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,170
That's my boss's wife.

385
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,970
Probably got me fired
back there.

386
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,310
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.

387
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,440
- I'm your wife and you never...
- Rachel.

388
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,390
- You never fucking support me.
- Rachel, please stop it.

389
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,840
Hey, come on.
Need you to focus here.

390
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,010
<i>Don't fucking talk</i>

391
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,160
- to me like that!
- Relax!

392
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,380
Relax!

393
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,500
- Rachel.
- Hi, Cathy. I'm sorry.

394
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,130
- There you are.
- I need to get my shit together.

395
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,710
- I'm s...
- Shh.

396
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,470
You must be Ms. Watson.

397
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,840
I'm detective Riley.

398
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
This is detective Gaskill.

399
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,920
We need to ask you
a few questions.

400
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,810
What's this about?

401
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,650
Want to sit down?

402
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,250
Can you tell me
where you were Friday night?

403
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,470
I-I was at work
in the city, and then...

404
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,870
and then I went
to visit my husband.

405
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,570
You mean your ex-husband?

406
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,870
Yeah.

407
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,195
So I got off the train

408
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:50,710
at Ardsley-on-Hudson,

409
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,510
and then...

410
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,040
And then I decided
that it was a bad idea.

411
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,720
Around what time
did you reach that conclusion?

412
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,360
I was back here by 11:00.

413
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,220
Yeah. Yeah.

414
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,450
On your way back here,
did you stop anywhere?

415
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,360
No.

416
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,030
And what time did you
take the train there?

417
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,590
Um, 6:00. I...

418
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,000
So...

419
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,400
What'd you do
during those hours in Ardsley,

420
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,210
if you weren't seeing
your ex-husband?

421
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,915
Do you remember
seeing this woman?

422
00:33:31,115 --> 00:33:33,710
She worked for your ex-husband.

423
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,550
She's gone missing.

424
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,790
What do you mean, she's missing?

425
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,790
Well, her husband said
she never came back home

426
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,860
the same night you got off
the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.

427
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,245
I was just... I was just...

428
00:33:45,445 --> 00:33:46,760
Do you know Megan Hipwell?

429
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,040
- No!
- Did you see her?

430
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,025
No, I don't...
I don't think so.

431
00:33:50,225 --> 00:33:52,010
Is that because
you were inebriated?

432
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,300
Just to clarify, you said
you were at work Friday?

433
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:59,310
Are you referring to your job
in public relations?

434
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,740
Right.

435
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,150
It's my understanding
you were fired

436
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,640
from that job over a year ago

437
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,880
because of
your drinking problem.

438
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,440
Okay. That's enough for now.

439
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,800
If you're able
to remember anything else,

440
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,310
give us a call.

441
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,680
Did you really get fired?

442
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,445
Look, I didn't want you to worry

443
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:35,210
that I couldn't pay the rent.

444
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,990
If you don't have a job,
then what do you do every day?

445
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,620
I...

446
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,980
I-I ride the train.

447
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,490
You what?

448
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,140
I ride the train
to New York and back.

449
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,790
That's what
your alimony's paying for,

450
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,970
just tickets to nowhere?

451
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,170
That's really fucking weird,
Rachel.

452
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,210
O-okay, okay.

453
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,210
I just, I-I got on the train,

454
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,470
and then... and then I...
I got off the train.

455
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,710
I don't know.
It's-it's very unclear.

456
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,890
You don't remember anything,
do you?

457
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,590
You know, I read about this man
in long island...

458
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,590
Who blacked out.

459
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,390
He left a bar,

460
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,760
drove to the house
that he'd grown up in,

461
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,460
stabbed its occupants to death.

462
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,160
<i>He woke up the next morning,</i>

463
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,700
oblivious to what he did
until the police

464
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,160
<i>came to get him.</i>

465
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,410
- Rachel!
- What? What?

466
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,900
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.

467
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,840
- I'll give you a few weeks...
- Hold on.

468
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,070
Hold on.

469
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,410
Detective Riley!

470
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,540
- Yeah, I agree with you.
- Detective Riley!

471
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,180
I saw someone
with Megan Hipwell,

472
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,760
but, uh, not on Friday night.

473
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,580
She...

474
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,205
She was having an affair,
she had a lover... that's what

475
00:35:50,405 --> 00:35:53,020
- I'm trying to tell you.
- I thought you didn't know her.

476
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,570
No. But I s... but I saw her.

477
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:57,220
- You saw her where?
- I-I saw her from the train.

478
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,460
She was standing on-on the deck
with this man.

479
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,610
- With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
- No, it wasn't him.

480
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,560
This... man was different,

481
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,530
and th-they were...
They were kissing.

482
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,200
Wow. That's pretty
coincidental, isn't it?

483
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,280
You just happen to be on a train

484
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,360
at the same exact moment
that a woman you don't know,

485
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,440
but somehow recognize,
is cheating on her husband?

486
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,210
I-I know it sounds crazy.
Um...

487
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,790
Neighbors saw a drunk woman

488
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:22,060
in the vicinity of her house
Friday night.

489
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,300
Megan Hipwell does bear
a resemblance to Anna Watson.

490
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,760
Mrs. Watson reported

491
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,890
that you go to their house
sometimes uninvited,

492
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,800
and that on one occasion
you actually broke in

493
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,300
and took their child.

494
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,240
Let me give you some advice.

495
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,420
Don't go back to Beckett road.

496
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,600
Don't contact your ex-husband.

497
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,910
Don't go anywhere near
Anna Watson or her baby.

498
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,610
Are you listening to me?

499
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,910
Yes.

500
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,150
You don't live there anymore.

501
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,150
Stay away.

502
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,100
<i>You know, I lie all the time.</i>

503
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,905
I lie to Scott.

504
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:13,470
I lie to you.

505
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,670
I mean, I know that's not
the point of therapy, but...

506
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,310
I have to keep things vague.

507
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,790
Jumble up all the men
and the exes, the lovers.

508
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,980
It doesn't matter who they are.

509
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:33,550
It matters
how they make me feel.

510
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,130
Lying is like taking a trip.

511
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,650
It's like having a secret.

512
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,250
It's like touching yourself
and no one else knows.

513
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,990
Except you.

514
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,660
But you're just pretending.

515
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:16,170
You're just pretending
to touch yourself.

516
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,140
Scott's possessive, jealous.

517
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,510
He likes to own me.

518
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,620
He figures out all my passwords.

519
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,600
Which is kind of sexy.

520
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,900
So, when I came home last night,

521
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:57,380
Scott was on my laptop,
wondering why...

522
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,820
Scott's behavior is not normal.

523
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,980
It's a form of emotional abuse.

524
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,480
Are you ever afraid of Scott?

525
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:12,060
It's not abuse.

526
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,630
Not if you don't care,
and I don't.

527
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,900
Maybe it's become
a normal state for you.

528
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,500
Is it normal I think about you
all the time?

529

Yes. Rachel.

Come in.

544
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,420
- Do you want a coffee?
- Uh, sure. Thank you.

545
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,550
Sorry it's a mess.

546
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,150
I've been hunting for her
social, her birth certificate.

547
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,660
And the cops need a lot.

548
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,160
Have we met somewhere before?

549
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,390
I... I don't think so.

550
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,700
And you know Megan from...?

551
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,300
Uh, from the gallery.

552
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,700
Oh, you're an artist?

553
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,730
Uh, well, I like to think so.

554
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,540
So, you said on the phone

555
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,520
you wanted to tell me
something about Megan.

556
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,890
What did you want to tell me?

557
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,540
I saw your wife...

558
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,730
With someone...

559
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,920
On Friday morning.

560
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:27,930
With who?

561
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,695
She was up there on your porch.

562
00:41:30,895 --> 00:41:33,460
Um... I saw her from the train,

563
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:37,240
because I commute
to Manhattan every day

564
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,640
and I go straight past here.

565
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,650
She kissed him.

566
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,820
They were kissing.

567
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,480
I'm sorry.

568
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,190
I know this is
a terrible thing to hear.

569
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,820
Yeah.

570
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,290
I know how it feels.

571
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,840
What did he look like?

572
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,840
He-he was...
He was average height.

573
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,420
He had dark hair.

574
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:23,090
And they were out there
on the porch?

575
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,850
Yes.

576
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,660
Fuck.

577
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,200
Fuck.

578
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,750
Oh, no, no, no. Thank you.

579
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,720
Okay, sure.

580
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,220
Uh, it could... I-I don't know.

581
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,770
Maybe it's a good thing.

582
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:06,320
Could mean she's all right.

583
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,960
She just ran off with someone.

584
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,960
Right.

585
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,370
Has she talked to you?

586
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:20,370
Oh, no, n...

587
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,200
Um, I haven't heard anything.

588
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:25,150
But you know her well enough
to know where we live.

589
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,920
Megan doesn't have many friends.

590
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,890
Well, I used to live nearby,
and, um, she and I,

591
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:35,490
we took... we took yog...
We took Pilates... together.

592
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,120
I-I think I should go.

593
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,190
I feel like I've taken up
too much of your time, and...

594
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,890
So sorry
to have had to tell you...

595
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,400
Tell you that in that way and...

596
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,970
Hey.

597
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:50,010
Do you think you'd recognize
him again if you saw him?

598
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,330
I don't know.

599
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,570
There's a guy. A therapist.

600
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,070
His name's, um, ab...

601
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,450
Abdic... Abdic.

602
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,110
Uh, Kamal... Abdic.

603
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:12,520
Is that who you saw?

604
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,430
I don't know.

605
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,900
I really can't tell.

606
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,840
She spends a lot of
fucking time with her shrink.

607
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,410
<i>That's him.</i>

608
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,590
I remember. That's him.

609
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,960
I remember.
That's him.

610
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,460
I'm sorry.

611
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:54,300
<i>Where are you? Where are you?</i>

612
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,230
Where are you?

613
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,610
Where are you?

614
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,370
Stay away from me!

615
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,980
<i>This is so stupid.</i>

616
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,390
He makes every conversation
about getting pregnant.

617
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,820
And every time we go there...

618
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,320
Where?

619
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,950
To that subject.

620
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,090
What subject?

621
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:55,860
Megan.

622
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,720
What subject?

623
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:16,890
It's okay.

624
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,920
Megan.

625
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,180
No!

626
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,360
Megan.

627
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,390
All right, Megan.

628
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,410
We shouldn't.

629
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,170
No.

630
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,510
Megan.

631
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,440
Don't make it impossible
for us to work together.

632
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,050
Meg...

633
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,330
Megan, I could lose my practice.

634
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:00,590
I don't give a fuck!

635
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:03,790
I don't give a fuck

00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,490
- What?
- There wasn't enough evidence.

652
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,940
And because I'm the one that
got him arrested, he talked.

653
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,740
A lot.

654
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,810
They'll... they'll build a case
against him.

655
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,410
It'll just take some time.

656
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,780
Are you totally sure he's
the guy you saw Megan with?

657
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:24,920
Yes.

658
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,850
You sure as fuck better be.

659
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,280
I don't understand.

660
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,310
- The police think I did it.
- Yeah, but he's...

661
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,660
- He's the one...
- He told them Megan's miserable.

662
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:37,450
That I'm a jealous,
controlling husband.

663
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,000
I'm sure that they're just...
Trying to rule you out.

664
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,020
Abdic told them I'm abusive.

665
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:48,860
When she walked out,
I... I didn't go after her.

666
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,970
I never called to check on her.

667
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:55,210
I went to a sports bar,
for fuck's sake.

668
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:56,280
Got drunk.

669
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,380
No, we j...
We just need to find

670
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:59,680
more evidence on Abdic.

671
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,040
I've spent the whole day
going through her stuff.

672
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:04,150
There's no e-mails.
There's nothing.

673
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:05,580
No letters, no e-mails.

674
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,020
Nothing.

675
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,780
For a second, I thought about
contacting Abdic myself.

676
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,820
Fucking phone won't stop!

677
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,660
This is Scott.

678
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:20,870
Yeah, yeah.
H-hold on, hold on.

679
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,710
Do you mind?

680
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,520
Oh. Come here.

681
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,420
Oh, you're heavy. You're heavy.

682
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,590
- You're getting a little fatty.
- Rachel, no.

683
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,100
Anna, get in the house.

684
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:05,740
Your-your... your wife hit me
on Friday night!

685
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,850
No. What are you talking about?

686
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:08,720
Yes. Yes, yes, you did.
Yes, you did!

687
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,750
And then sh... and then she...
She-she got in your car.

688
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:15,220
No. She said you yelled at her
that night.

689
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,620
No, that is not what happened.

690
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,220
She was... she was in
the tunnel, and she-she hit me.

691
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,850
I don't want to argue
in the street.

692
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,670
The middle of the day
and you're drunk.

693
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,120
Look, I'm not drunk, tom.

694
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:29,670
My wife is scared of you.

695
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,400
Of what?

696
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:35,400
I don't even know
if that's a joke or not.

697
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,450
- Let's start with child abduction.
- That's bullshit.

698
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:38,970
You know that's not
how it happened.

699
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,690
You and I both know
what you're capable of.

700
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,090
Were you just
at Scott Hipwell's house?

701
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:54,790
Why are you at
Scott Hipwell's house?

702
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,370
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.

703
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,790
- How?
- To try and find Megan.

704
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,100
You don't even know Megan.

705
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,000
Rach...

706
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,200
I don't think
you're helping anybody.

707
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,980
<i>So you're here because you want</i>

708
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,650
to uncover lost memories.

709
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:16,290
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.

710
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,610
Pardon?

711
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,950
No, sorry, I-I, um,

712
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:21,850
wasn't expecting you
to have an accent.

713
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,730
Well, you have an accent.

714
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,160
Where are you from?

715
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,490
I'm an American citizen.

716
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,800
But I guess you're not here
to talk about me.

717
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,640
- Unless you are.
- No, no, I...

718
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,040
Sorry, I was just, uh, just
trying to make conversation.

719
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,040
The blackouts.

720
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,040
You're experiencing blackouts?

721
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,140
Mm-hmm.

722
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,440
Do you want to tell me
about them?

723
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,710
Mm...

724
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,550
Well, when I...

725
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:57,380
Wake up, and when someone
tells me what I've done...

726
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:02,230
it just doesn't feel like me

727
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,860
or like something
that I would do.

728
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:07,470
I feel bad about it, but, um...

729
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:10,270
But it's like
it's so far removed,

730
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:12,270
that I have a...

731
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,570
I just don't feel bad enough.

732
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,510
And you want to take
personal responsibility

733
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,310
for what you've done,
but you find it difficult

734
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:23,680
to feel accountable because
you can't even remember it.

735
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,350
Yeah?

736
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,090
Yeah.

737
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:33,920
So, Rachel, besides drinking...

738
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:37,860
Because you clearly drink.

739
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,330
You've been drinking today,
haven't you?

740
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:50,200
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?

741
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,810
I like to draw. Art.

742
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,640
I guess.

743
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:56,890
Good. We can try to...

744
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,950
Regain some of your memories
by drawing them.

745
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:01,050
I've tried it. It doesn't work.

746
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,120
And have you ever tracked
all the way back

747
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,650
to when you started
drinking heavily?

748
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,320
When was that?

749
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:12,270
It was with tom.

750
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:15,270
When I couldn't get pregnant.

751
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,070
Who's tom?

752
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:19,330
He's my ex-husband.

753
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,180
You want to talk about that?

754
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,210
I really wanted a baby.

755
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,930
And we tried everything,
and nothing worked.

756
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,720
And it just absolutely...

757
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,590
It just broke my...

758
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:00,010
My heart, and...

759
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,540
So it got really sad.

760
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,450
And then, um...

761
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:10,130
and then the-the booze
just, uh, broke us.

762
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,690
Good.

763
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,260
Tell me more.

764
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:23,470
I used to watch
this perfect couple.

765
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,070
And they were just the...

766
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,510
Embodiment of...

767
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,170
True love.

768
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,390
It's like the kind of love
you always want.

769
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:42,620
And then she betrayed him.

770
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,460
And it sparked something in me.

771
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:58,185
Why are you really here, Rachel?

772
00:54:58,385 --> 00:55:01,400
Because I'm afraid of myself.

773
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,840
<i>July 5th.</i>

774
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,165
<i>1:33 and 1:34.</i>

775
00:55:14,365 --> 00:55:16,680
<i>1:37.</i>

776
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,050
She calls again 1:38.

777
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,760
And then she calls again
at 1:44, 1:45,

778
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,620
2:15 P.M.

779
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:24,570
And July 6th.
You get the point.

780
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:28,600
She sometimes texted him
dozens of times a day.

781
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,035
But these are all
from an unknown number.

782
00:55:31,235 --> 00:55:33,470
- Mm, and unknown is Rachel.
- You have a log

783
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,230
of the calls;
You don't have a log

784
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,800
of what they're saying
to each other.

785
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:41,570
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house

786
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:44,040
- since the incident with your child?
- Not that I know of.

787
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,610
Well, then you may have a case

788
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,090
for harassment
in the second degree,

789
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,130
but these are texts,
they're not threats, so...

790
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,220
She has been hanging around
Scott Hipwell's house.

791
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:54,430
A lot.

792
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,560
Yeah, I'm aware.

793
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,730
There are a lot
of loose ends here

794
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:01,390
that suggest something,
but they don't add up to much.

795
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,260
If you could bring me
something more solid...

796
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:06,470
What more do you need?

797
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:07,570
Evidence.

798
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,740
Real evidence.

799
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,280
You sure your husband

800
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,680
doesn't want to stay in touch
with his ex-wife?

801
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:19,890
What? No.

802
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,420
She's harassing us.

803
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,020
Is that what he calls it?

804
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,430
Hi.

805
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:16,140
- Hey.
- Hi.

806
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,670
Hi.

807
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,280
Reporters are in my yard.

808
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,480
They're everywhere.

809
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,710
I didn't know where else to go.

810
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,320
Come in.

811
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,700
The detective just...

812
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:15,230
The detective
just told me something

813
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,640
I've wanted to hear
for a long time.

814
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:24,140
She's pregnant.

815
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:28,810
She told her shrink but not me.

816
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,450
I wanted a family.

817
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:37,550
But she fought me
every step of the way.

818
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:41,230
We always fought about it.

819
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,170
Did Megan ever say anything
about me to you?

820
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:56,910
She loved you.

821
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,480
She loved you in ways

822
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,310
that people only dream
of being loved.

823
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,780
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

824
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:15,020
I just...

825
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:18,050
I need to tell someone.

826
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,790
Just once.

827
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:23,390
Just say it out loud.

828
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,130
I want to tell you.

829
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:31,160
And then I'll be gone.

830
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,130
I swear.

831
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,420
I got pregnant.

832
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,050
I was 17.

833
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:50,150
I had her by myself.

834
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:57,820
She had dark eyes
and blond hair.

835
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:06,280
I expected it to be hard,
but it wasn't.

836
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,040
It was easy.

837
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:16,980
Because I loved her.

838
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,480
I loved her.

839
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:25,050
We called her Elizabeth.

840
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,960
Libby.

841
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:31,070
Libby.

842
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:39,400
It was December.

843
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:42,380
We had gotten in a fight,
me and Mac.

844
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:48,450
He'd gone off
and... and left.

845
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:52,580
<i>The roof was leaking.</i>

846
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:55,855
<i>It was freezing cold, so...</i>

847
01:01:56,055 --> 01:01:59,320
<i>I got in the tub.</i>

848
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:01,990
<i>I brought Libby in with me.</i>

849
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,060
<i>Put her on my chest.</i>

850
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:08,660
Her head just... under my chin.

851
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,950
I fell asleep.

852
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,710
<i>I let her go.</i>

853
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,780
<i>I let her go.</i>

854
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,860
I let her go.

855
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,870
I let her go.

856
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,430
<i>I...</i>

857
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,090
<i>I couldn't look.</i>

858
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:47,780
<i>I didn't want to see it.</i>

859
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:54,170
I wrapped her in a blanket,

860
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:57,080
and I buried her.

861
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:14,390
And...

862
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,040
Mac went out that night...

863
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:24,940
and he never came back.

864
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:29,220
He never came back.

865
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,760
I missed our home.

866
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,645
So one day, when I was drunk,

867
01:04:01,845 --> 01:04:04,510
<i>I decided to go there.</i>

868
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:12,050
<i>The front door was open;
It's not like I broke in.</i>

869
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:27,140
<i>And then I heard Evie.</i>

870
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:30,610
<i>Who's Evie?</i>

871
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:33,010
<i>Tom's baby.</i>

872
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:56,830
<i>And I know this sounds...</i>

873
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,740
<i>Insane...</i>

874
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:02,340
<i>But I just wanted to hold her.</i>

875
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,250
<i>Just for a moment.</i>

876
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,640
Rachel.

877
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,740
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

878
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,590
Rachel...

879
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:54,520
Give her to me.

880
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:56,430
Shh, shh, shh.

881
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:58,530
Oh. Mommy's here.

882
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:01,860
Shh.
Oh.

883
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:04,270
Shh.

884
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,610
<i>I wasn't going to hurt her.</i>

885
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:12,650
<i>I would never hurt her.</i>

886
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:19,020
I just wanted to hold her.

887
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,770
<i>"Partially decomposed
body found.</i>

888
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:48,110
<i>"Female body found. Death a
result of blunt force trauma.</i>

889
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:50,440
<i>"Blunt force trauma, partially
decomposed body found...</i>

890
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:51,720
<i>"Megan Hipwell,
blunt force trauma,</i>

891
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,120
<i>"partially decomposed...</i>

892
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,260
<i>"The investigation now
being called a homicide.</i>

893
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:58,450
<i>"Sources say the partially
decomposed body found</i>

894
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:00,430
<i>"is missing Ardsley woman
Megan Hipwell.</i>

895
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:03,100
<i>"Death a result
of blunt force trauma.</i>

896
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:07,070
<i>Megan Hipwell's investigation
now being called a homicide."</i>

897
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:09,200
Mr. Hipwell!

898
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,550
What's wrong?

899
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:55,370
I'm sorry.

900
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:19,160
This reminds me of when I used
to watch you getting dressed

901
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:20,630
before going back to her.

902
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:28,910
Back to this house.

903
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:35,020
I actually miss being
the other woman.

904
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:37,020
Did you enjoy
cheating on Rachel?

905
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:39,920
Seriously?

906
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:42,460
Can we not fixate on her?

907
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:45,830
I saw her again today.

908
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:47,560
Where?

909
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:49,670
This afternoon, when the police
brought Scott back home.

910
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:51,070
She was across the street.

911
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:58,040
And when she saw me,
she got aggressive.

912
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,170
Aggressive how?

913
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:02,380
What if Rachel killed Megan?

914
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:04,580
Rachel did not kill Megan.

915
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:06,550
Then why is she creeping
around Scott's house?

916
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,610
- She's dangerous, and you know it.
- Anna, Anna.

917
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:12,250
Sweetheart...
Rachel is a sad person.

918
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:15,300
She's completely harmless.

919
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:43,720
What are you doing here?

920
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,950
How di... how did you get in?

921
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:51,760
Come here.

922
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,430
Have a beer with me.

923
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:57,160
Uh, I'm-I'm not drinking
right now.

924
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:05,500
Detective Riley
came to see me last night.

925
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:10,580
It turns out,
I'm not the father.

926
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:13,250
Neither is the shrink.

927
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:18,090
Did my wife confide in you
about a third man?

928
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:23,090
Sit down.

929
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:29,230
Sit down!

930
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:34,310
Look, I don't know, I don't
know what this is about...

931
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:35,410
Oh, come on.

932
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:38,210
You and Megan
were such good friends.

933
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:42,010
You must've known.

934
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,210
Admit it.

935
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:46,950
Admit what?

936
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:50,020
Admit that you never even
fucking met my wife.

937
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:55,750
The detective said
you didn't even know Megan.

938
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:00,460
She used other words, too.

939
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:02,470
Alcoholic.

940
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:04,210
Maybe even mentally unstable.

941
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:05,660
I am sorry.

942
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:07,400
I was honestly just
trying to help you.

943
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,870
You're tom's crazy ex.

944
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,210
When the fuck were you
gonna tell me that, huh?

945
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:16,740
And now the detective
is asking if you and I are

946
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:17,850
in a relationship?

947
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:19,340
You?

948
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:23,050
I would never even
get near someone like you!

949
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,390
My wife is dead.

950
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:28,050
And you're lying to me!

951
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:30,060
What's wrong with you?

952
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:31,860
- Who does this?
- I needed to tell you

953
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,060
about Megan's affair,

954
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:34,340
and you wouldn't
have believed me

955
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,660
if I was just tom's ex!

956
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:37,340
Oh, well, thank you, you know?

957
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:40,170
For getting Abdic
to point the finger at me.

958
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:43,470
For getting the cops to say
that you and I are fucking!

959
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,910
How are they going, huh?

960
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,590
You know, the sessions.

961
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:59,080
With the doctor.

962
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:03,360
I wanted to know about Abdic.

963
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,590
And I-I went to him
to help you...

964
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:09,090
You're just a sad liar
with no life.

965
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,100
- You're all liars.
- Please...

966
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,820
I need to file a statement.

967
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:34,630
Name.

968
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:36,475
Rachel Watson.

969
01:12:36,675 --> 01:12:38,320
Pete, I got this.

970
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:53,240
You wanted to file a statement?

971
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:54,810
I'm listening.

972
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:57,480
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.

973
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:01,180
You mean your new boyfriend,
Scott Hipwell?

974
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:03,420
No, we-we were just friends.

975
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,355
But that's what you wanted,
isn't it?

976
01:13:05,555 --> 01:13:07,090
I mean, you got him
to stay overnight

977
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:08,450
- at your apartment, right?
- No, you-you...

978
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:09,960
You need the context...

979
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,460
I know the context, but
what I'm trying to determine

980
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,930
is when your obsession
with Mr. Hipwell began.

981
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:17,960
Was it before or after
his pregnant wife was murdered?

982
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:20,700
I mean, you were neighbors
at one point.

983
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:21,640
I met him after.

984
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,870
After being questioned by me,

985
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,480
you befriend another even more
obvious suspect than yourself,

986
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:29,380
and then you manage to get him
to incriminate himself,

987
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,610
all the while
hoping he'll fuck you.

988
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,920
I came here trying to help you!

989
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:37,190
He just assaulted me
in my own house!

990
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,400
You were seen
in the area that night.

991
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,660
There are several hours

992
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:46,160
that you say
you can't account for.

993
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:49,200
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.

994
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,230
No, he didn't.

995
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,670
Surveillance footage
from a sports bar

996
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:59,270
accounts for Mr. Hipwell's
whereabouts that night.

997
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,290
You're lying. You're lying.

998
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:10,550
Tell me what happened.

999
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:16,890
It's okay.

1000
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:19,490
Tell me.

1001
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:23,540
I don't know.

1002
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:27,140
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?

1003
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:45,250
Hi.

1004
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:49,160
I need to see you.

1005
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,320
Can you please come over?

1006
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:07,240
<i>I can still see her dark eyes.</i>

1007
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:09,350
<i>I can smell her skin.</i>

1008
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:13,190
<i>I can feel how cold she was.</i>

1009
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:16,110
Forgive yourself.

1010
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,310
You don't have to be afraid
of being alone.

1011
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,570
You're not alone.

1012
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:53,720
The next
station is Ardsley-on-Hudson.

1013
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:03,970
You'll be fine.

1014
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:06,070
You and your baby will be fine.

1015
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:49,240
Why are you following me?

1016
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,720
Why are you here?

1017
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,050
Uh...

1018
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,480
I could ask you
the same question.

1019
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:57,320
I saw you.

1020
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,350
I saw you that night
in the tunnel.

1021
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,630
I saw you there.

1022
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:03,160
- And I-I know I saw you there.
- All right.

1023
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,420
Lady, I live here.

1024
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:07,060
I'm always in that tunnel.

1025
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:09,600
But-but what did you,
what did you see?

1026
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,160
What happened that night?

1027
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:12,370
What did you see?

1028
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:13,720
All right, you, uh...

1029
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,070
You busted your ass.

1030
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:16,530
You fell.

1031
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:18,955
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.

1032
01:17:19,155 --> 01:17:21,570
You told me to fuck off,
so I fucked off.

1033
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,910
Was I with anyone?

1034
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,315
Was I, was I alone?

1035
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:25,910
Was i... what happened?

1036
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,585
I don't know.

1037
01:17:27,785 --> 01:17:29,250
You were wasted.

1038
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:32,050
You're always wasted.

1039
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:35,260
That's all I can tell you.

1040
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:36,790
Whoa, take it easy.

1041
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:41,630
I need you to tell me
the fucking truth.

1042
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:43,530
What did you see that night?

1043
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:47,270
What happened that night?

1044
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:49,700
Uh... I don't know.

1045
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:53,510
I'm assuming it's the worst.

1046
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,550
God.

1047
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:05,320
Come here for one second.

1048
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,890
Just one second.

1049
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:08,690
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."

1050
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:11,260
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

1051
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,790
I wonder if she knows
that I fucked tom on the...

1052
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:18,630
When I saw that woman

1053
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,640
kissing someone else,
betraying her husband,

1054
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,100
<i>I felt it.</i>

1055
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:25,810
<i>Pure rage.</i>

1056
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:28,325
<i>If I could, I'd go to her house,</i>

1057
01:18:28,525 --> 01:18:30,840
<i>I'd find her sitting and...</i>

1058
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,690
<i>I'd smash her head</i>

1059
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:37,060
all over the floor!

1060
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:49,330
<i>Cathy,</i>

1061
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:51,700
<i>thank you for all
you have done for me.</i>

1062
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:53,270
<i>I'm sorry to leave this way.</i>

1063
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:55,470
<i>I'll send for my things later.</i>

1064
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:56,870
<i>Love, Rachel.</i>

1065
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:21,130
That's so true.

1066
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:23,400
It's the worst restaurant ever.

1067
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,460
Why do we keep going back?

1068
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:27,130
Martha.

1069
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,640
Martha.

1070
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:33,310
Rachel?

1071
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:35,510
Wow, I haven't seen you
in a million years.

1072
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,640
Um...

1073
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:39,380
Yeah, I-I wanted to call you,

1074
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:42,550
um, but tom said I should
just leave it alone.

1075
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:44,250
- Oh.
- Um...

1076
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:46,310
I'm so sorry.

1077
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:48,360
For what?

1078
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,890
For the barbecue.

1079
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,030
And I just need you to know

1080
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:56,160
that I-I don't remember
anything and, um,

1081
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:57,670
I just completely blacked out.

1082
01:19:57,870 --> 01:19:59,540
Everyone had a little
too much to drink,

1083
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:00,880
- so it's okay.
- I know, but, uh,

1084
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,870
with the eggs
and then I-I screamed at you.

1085
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:07,180
That I was that abusive,
I just feel...

1086
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:10,110
I just feel so ashamed about it.

1087
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,150
Um...

1088
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:13,820
I don't...

1089
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:16,705
Tom... tom said that, um...

1090
01:20:16,905 --> 01:20:19,590
That I smashed your plate.

1091
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:21,020
I don't...

1092
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:23,800
Tom was fired...
Fired because of how I behaved.

1093
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:29,070
You felt sick and you took
a nap in our guest bedroom.

1094
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:30,920
<i>You want to lie down?</i>

1095
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,770
- Come with me.
- Okay.

1096
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:36,210
Excuse us.

1097
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:38,280
Rachel, are you feeling better?

1098
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,260
You guys can
stay tonight if you want.

1099
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:42,240
- No, no. That's fine, thanks.
- Okay.

1100
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:43,450
<i>I think I'd remember</i>

1101
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:45,550
<i>if you caused a scene.</i>

1102
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:47,610
I'm so sorry.

1103
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:50,780
Get up.

1104
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:56,250
And then tom took you home.

1105
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:58,620
- Sorry, tom...
- Stop fucking saying that!

1106
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:00,660
- I know you're sorry!
- Sorry.

1107
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:02,555
What's your fucking problem?
Can't even focus on me.

1108
01:21:02,755 --> 01:21:04,640
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?

1109
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:05,640
Can you stand?

1110
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:09,980
Fucking disgusting.

1111
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:12,925
<i>N-no.</i>

1112
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:14,440
No.

1113
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:15,880
Yeah, tom got fired

1114
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,740
'cause he couldn't keep
his dick in his pants.

1115
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:19,950
You did nothing wrong.

1116
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:21,380
Nothing.

1117
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,990
<i>Wake the fuck up, Rachel.</i>

1118
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,160
<i>Wake the fuck up!</i>

1119
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,730
Wake up!

1120
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,500
You can sleep out here.

1121
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:44,480
<i>We all felt so bad for you.</i>

1122
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:47,140
He's such a bad guy.

1123
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:48,950
Oh, god.

1124
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:51,020
Are you okay?

1125
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:20,220
Hmm.

1126
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:59,220
<i>I need to see you.</i>

1127
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:00,820
<i>Meet me at 3:00.</i>

1128
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:03,850
<i>I'm here. Where are you?</i>

1129
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:06,090
<i>I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.</i>

1130
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:20,400
What are you doing up?

1131
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:23,780
Picking up after Evie.

1132
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,020
You whore!

1133
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,320
Leave us alone.

1134
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:41,985
No new messages.

1135
01:24:42,185 --> 01:24:43,950
No saved messages.

voice mail greeting,

Hi, it's Megan.

1143
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,040
Leave a message.

1144
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:14,320
You okay?

1145
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,850
I thought I heard something.

1146
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:18,890
You should wake me up
if you heard something.

1147
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:20,550
I just, I...

1148
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:25,170
Well, come back to bed.

1149
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,620
Whore!

1150
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:27,290
Rachel's down there.

1151
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:37,470
What the hell are you doing?

1152
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:38,570
Come here.

1153
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:43,130
Hey, get the fuck
out of here, okay?

1154
01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:44,600
Get the fuck out of here!

1155
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,330
You're okay.
Just need some help.

1156
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:47,590
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

1157
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:48,840
Just need to get
a little help up.

1158
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,070
- Just fuck off. Fuck off!
- Come on. Come on.

1159
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,350
You're heavy. Aw.

1160
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:36,220
Come here.

1161
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:37,450
Anna?

1162
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:38,860
No.

1163
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:40,860
- Anna, please, please?
- No, go away.

1164
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:41,830
- There's... okay.
- Go!

1165
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:43,790
I'm-I'm gonna stand right here.

1166
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,430
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.

1167
01:28:45,630 --> 01:28:47,430
I don't want to hear
anything you have to say.

1168
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:48,860
Where's tom?

1169
01:28:57,070 --> 01:28:59,200
He's lying to you.

1170
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:00,870
He-he always does.

1171
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,730
He's-he's a good liar...

1172
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:04,580
I know he's a good liar.

1173
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:07,210
We went behind your back
for months.

1174
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:08,750
He's just done it to you.

1175
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:10,480
I know he's cheating.

1176
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,550
I know.

1177
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,290
Anna, he-he killed Megan...

1178
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:19,430
No, we don't,
we don't know that.

1179
01:29:19,630 --> 01:29:21,490
- He's dangerous.
- We don't know anything.

1180
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,350
- Anna, you-you need to leave.
- No. No.

1181
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:25,200
You need to leave.
You need to take Evie

1182
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,960
- and you need to leave, get out of here.
- No.

1183
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:29,330
- It's not safe...
- I'm not leaving him.

1184
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:32,340
It's hardly the first time
he's had an affair.

1185
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:34,770
It's not about the affair.

1186
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:36,620
And you... you know that
deep down.

1187
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:38,140
Anna, please,

1188
01:29:38,150 --> 01:29:39,920
- just come with me.
- I'm not leaving him.

1189
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:41,020
Please come with me.

1190
01:29:43,190 --> 01:29:45,590
- Anna, don't, don't...
- Come in the house, honey.

1191
01:29:45,790 --> 01:29:46,980
Please.

1192
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:51,760
I saw you, tom.
You motherfucker!

1193
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,420
I saw you, you murderer!

1194
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:55,360
You fucking murderer!

1195
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:57,510
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!

1196
01:29:57,710 --> 01:29:59,260
I know it!

1197
01:29:59,270 --> 01:30:01,130
Un-fucking-believable!

1198
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:02,270
Now, listen. Listen to me.

1199
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:03,630
Megan got into his car
that night.

1200
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,100
You think I don't remember.

1201
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:06,650
You thought I blacked out!
I saw you.

1202
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:08,140
Why did Megan get in your car?

1203
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:10,050
- Did Megan get in your car?
- No!

1204
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:11,920
Yes, she did.

1205
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,180
Tell her the truth.

1206
01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:15,790
Just tell her
the truth right now.

1207
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:18,530
You attacked me in that tunnel
because I saw her with you.

1208
01:30:18,730 --> 01:30:19,550
I found Megan's phone.

1209
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,770
I found it.

1210
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,430
So, all those phone calls,
they weren't from Rachel.

1211
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:40,810
So, were you fucking her
while she was here working?

1212
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:43,310
While she was looking after
our daughter?

1213
01:30:45,050 --> 01:30:48,760
You... you were
so tired all the time.

1214
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,900
It's all about Evie.

1215
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:04,000
That's right.

1216
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,160
Your daddy loves you.

1217
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:08,170
Tom?

1218
01:31:08,370 --> 01:31:11,340
- Give her to me.
- That's right.

1219
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:13,000
Your daddy loves you.

1220
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:15,870
Tom, give her to me, please?

1221
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,910
- Please give her to me.
- It's fine.

1222
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:18,920
I think she needs
changing, please.

1223
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,320
No, she's gonna be fine.

1224
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,390
Please just give her to me.
Oh, okay. Shh, shh.

1225
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:24,360
- Let her go. You're going to hurt her.
- Change her here.

1226
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,420
- Change her here.
- You're... okay.

1227
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:26,450
I'll change her. Let her go.

1228
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:27,530
You're gonna hurt her.

1229
01:31:27,730 --> 01:31:29,230
Shh.

1230
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:31,530
You're okay, you're okay.

1231
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:33,300
Shh, shh.

1232
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,940
Shh.

1233
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:43,030
911, what's your...

1234
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:47,110
What's your emergency?

1235
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,260
No, no. Stay.

1236
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:02,200
Stay.

1237
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:10,430
Do you need a drink?

1238
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:12,400
No.

1239
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,150
Yeah, you do.

1240
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:35,300
All those things
that you said I did.

1241
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:40,900
Those terrible things...
I didn't do any of them.

1242
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,285
You just watched me suffer.

1243
01:32:45,485 --> 01:32:47,770
You made me feel so worthless.

1244
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:52,410
You made me think that
everything was my fault.

1245
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:03,790
Drink it.

1246
01:33:11,030 --> 01:33:13,400
You told me I got you fired.

1247
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:16,970
But I didn't.

1248
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,570
You know, I saw Martha
on the train...

1249
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:25,170
Drink it!

1250
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:34,580
I saw Martha on the train.

1251
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:37,250
And she told me
that you were fired

1252
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:40,460
because you were fucking
everyone in the office!

1253
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,050
Rachel's down there.

1254
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:07,420
Wait here.

1255
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:45,720
You gonna get in the car?

1256
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,250
What's going on?

1257
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:49,730
Don't worry about it.

1258
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:52,130
Come on.

1259
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:12,865
Okay, I'm here.

1260
01:35:13,065 --> 01:35:15,080
So, what is it?

1261
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:19,990
I just want to go to the woods.

1262
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:42,410
What is it with you crazy women?

1263
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,830
This what you want?

1264
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,940
No.

1265
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:18,790
Like this?

1266
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,990
What?

1267
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:27,930
I'm pregnant.

1268
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:33,470
Congratulations.

1269
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:38,100
I thought you should know.

1270
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:40,500
You thought I should know?

1271
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:44,740
There's a chance
it could be yours.

1272
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:46,470
Then get an abortion.

1273
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:50,070
Or if it's Scott's,
do whatever you want.

1274
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:53,580
But if it's not,
then get rid of it.

1275
01:36:58,190 --> 01:37:01,460
You can be as involved
as you want.

1276
01:37:02,530 --> 01:37:04,030
You were a shitty nanny.

1277
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:06,230
What makes you think
you're gonna be a good mother?

1278
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:11,600
Why did you bring me there
in the first place?

1279
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,770
Because I thought it would be
fun to have you both around.

1280
01:37:17,970 --> 01:37:18,970
Come on.

1281
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:25,050
I played your game
so you could fuck me

1282
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:26,450
in between Evie's playdates.

1283
01:37:26,650 --> 01:37:28,880
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.

1284
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:31,530
I took care of your kid
to be near you!

1285
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:36,420
You fucked Anna 'cause you
couldn't fuck Rachel anymore,

1286
01:37:36,430 --> 01:37:38,845
and you fucked me 'cause
you couldn't fuck Anna!

1287
01:37:39,045 --> 01:37:41,460
Take us all away
and you're just a pathetic,

1288
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:42,900
impotent man!

1289
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,580
You're... you're not
gonna get rid of me.

1290
01:38:02,590 --> 01:38:06,760
You're gonna pay for this child
for the rest of your life.

1291
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:15,330
I can just... yeah.

1292
01:39:10,490 --> 01:39:12,460
You're like a dog.

1293
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:17,220
Like one of those unwanted,

1294
01:39:17,230 --> 01:39:19,470
mistreated dogs.

1295
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,340
And you can kick them.

1296
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:27,530
They keep coming back to you.

1297
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:29,940
Thinking that somehow
if they're good...

1298
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:32,370
You're not doing this again.

1299
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:34,840
You'll love them.

1300
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:36,010
This is what you do.

1301
01:39:36,210 --> 01:39:39,180
You're not doing this to me.

1302
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:42,410
You brought this
on yourself, Rachel.

1303
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:47,480
If you had just stayed away
that one night...

1304
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:53,360
Just left us all alone.

1305
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:58,755
You brought this on Megan.

1306
01:39:58,955 --> 01:40:01,740
In a way, you killed her.

1307
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:03,180
Mm-hmm.

1308
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,700
But I didn't.

1309
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,280
You did.

1310
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:22,950
No!

1311
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,560
No...

1312
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:31,500
You did this to me
in our marriage.

1313
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:36,010
You made me fucking crazy.

1314
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:42,650
Do you have any idea

1315
01:40:42,850 --> 01:40:45,120
what it's like to be
married to a fucking blur?

1316
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:36,885
I had no choice. He was...

1317
01:43:37,085 --> 01:43:40,420
He would've killed me.

1318
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:43,350
I never wanted to hurt him.

1319
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:49,590
It was self-defense.

1320
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:56,610
She had no choice.

1321
01:43:56,810 --> 01:43:58,780
Tom would've killed her.

1322
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:03,180
I saw the whole thing.

1323
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:09,410
Rachel was right about Megan.

1324
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,550
She was right about everything.

1325
01:44:58,670 --> 01:45:00,135
<i>We are tied forever now,</i>

1326
01:45:00,335 --> 01:45:01,800
<i>the three of us.</i>

1327
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:09,270
<i>Bound forever
by the story we share.</i>

1328
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:45,740
<i>Today I sit in a different car.</i>

1329
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:48,280
<i>And I look ahead.</i>

1330
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:50,220
<i>Anything is possible,</i>

1331
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:53,680
<i>because I am not the girl
I used to be.</i>

1332
01:45:53,880 --> 01:46:10,880
