00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:26,245
Hi. Ed Ramsey from Delos.

2
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:30,078
If there's anyone who doesn't know
what Delos is, well, as we've always said...

3
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:32,883
...Delos is the vacation
of the future, today.

4
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,783
At Delos you get your choice
of the vacation you want.

5
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:40,856
There's Medieval World, Roman World
and, of course, Westworld.

6
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:42,956
Let's talk to some people
who've been there.

7
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:44,431
Pardon me, sir. What is your name?

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,991
Gardner Lewis.
Just got back from Westworld.

9
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,604
Tell us how you liked it, Mr. Lewis.

10
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,233
When you played cowboys and Indians
as a kid, you'd point...

11
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:53,868
...go "bang, bang" and the other kid
would lie down and play dead.

12
00:00:53,944 --> 00:00:57,345
Well, Westworld is the same thing, only...
only it's for real!

13
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:02,445
I shot six people!
Well, they weren't real people!

14
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:05,280
What Mr. Lewis means is
he shot six robots...

15
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,688
...scientifically programmed to look, act,
talk and even bleed just like humans do.

16
00:01:09,762 --> 00:01:10,692
Isn't that right?

17
00:01:10,762 --> 00:01:14,061
Well, they may have been robots.
I mean, I think they were robots.

18
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,993
I mean, I know they were robots!

19
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,796
Yes, the robots of Westworld are there
to serve you...

20
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,773
...and to give you the most unique
vacation experience of your life.

21
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:24,900
Thank you, sir.

22
00:01:25,678 --> 00:01:27,269
And you, madam?

23
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:28,469
Hello.

24
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,774
What is your name?

25
00:01:29,848 --> 00:01:33,113
My name is Janet Lane,
and I was in Roman World.

26
00:01:33,284 --> 00:01:36,345
What is the one thing that stands out
in your mind about Roman World?

27
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:38,890
Oh, well, I think it would be...

28
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,390
...the men!

29
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:43,821
I just feel marvelous! I mean...

30
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:47,128
...it's just a warm,
glowing place to be!

31
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:48,866
Thank you very much.

32
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:51,663
Oh, thank you very much!

33
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,206
Goodbye.

34
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:54,330
Goodbye.

35
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,673
- And you, sir?
- Yeah?

36
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,268
What is your name, sir?

37
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:02,008
Oh, I'm Ted Mann.
I'm a stockbroker from St. Louis.

38
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:04,715
And, which world did you
just come from, sir?

39
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:06,685
Oh, you're not going to believe this!

40
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:10,211
I've just been the sheriff of Westworld
for the last two weeks!

41
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:12,188
Did it seem real to you, sir?

42
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:14,728
It's the realest thing I've ever done!
I mean that!

43
00:02:14,796 --> 00:02:16,825
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:18,991
And you, sir?

45
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:21,296
My name's Arthur Caine.
I've been in the castle.

46
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:24,667
I've had a couple of sword fights
and three jousts.

47
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:26,465
And I...

48
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,534
I married a beautiful princess.

49
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:32,575
Is that something you've
always dreamed of doing, sir?

50
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,011
All my life!

51
00:02:36,484 --> 00:02:39,510
There were some of the comments
of people who've just returned from Delos.

52
00:02:39,588 --> 00:02:40,781
Why don't you arrange...

53
00:02:40,855 --> 00:02:45,189
...to take our Hovercraft to Medieval World,
Roman World and Westworld?

54
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:47,357
Was it worth $1,000 a day?

55
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:49,589
Yes!

56
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:54,559
Contact us today, or see your travel agent.
Boy, have we got a vacation for you!

57
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:03,035
505. 345. 675. Delta 9.

58
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:07,008
505. 345. 675. Delta 9.

59
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:25,365
This is Delos Control to Station 3.

60
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:29,803
You are cleared on Vector 79, on 195...

61
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:34,204
We anticipate scanning
in about four and a half minutes.

62
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:52,720
I'm not worried at all. I'm just...

63
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:55,061
I'm just curious.

64
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:57,900
How much do they weigh?

65
00:03:58,269 --> 00:03:59,759
Three or four pounds.

66
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:01,301
That heavy.

67
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:05,603
Do they have much of a kick?

68
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:08,208
A Colt.45?

69
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:11,374
Well, I never fired one before.

70
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:19,914
What about that thing
where you go like this over the gun?

71
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,556
- Fanning?
- Yeah.

72
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:24,253
- What about it?
- Is that hard to do?

73
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:30,198
Now...

74
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:34,068
The gunbelt, does it have those strings
to tie around your leg?

75
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,402
If that's the kind you want.

76
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:39,467
That's the kind I want. I think it's
probably better for quick draws, you know.

77
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,275
It all depends.

78
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:46,779
What kind of gunbelt did you have
the last time?

79
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,888
I had the one without the strings.

80
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,582
And you could draw fast?

81
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,793
Then maybe it doesn't matter after all.

82
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,099
The guns they give you are real guns?

83
00:05:06,441 --> 00:05:07,532
Real guns.

84
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,799
That's incredible.

85
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,105
Give us a shift to 197...

86
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,012
...and take it down to Port 43.

87
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,016
Negative acceleration at 22.

88
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,845
So long as you maintain
passenger comfort.

89
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,724
Sigma-sigma was transferred
according to the log at 041.

90
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,996
The orientation on the resort
will now begin.

91
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:34,157
Please put on your earphones.

92
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,204
Don't you want to listen?

93
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,034
I heard it the last time.

94
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,745
...consists of three separate resort areas,
each with its own special appeal.

95
00:05:44,946 --> 00:05:46,503
Whichever resort you have chosen...

96
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:49,982
...we are sure you will have
a fascinating and rewarding stay here.

97
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:54,846
Western World is a complete re-creation
of the American frontier of 1880.

98
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:59,416
Here it is possible to relive the excitement
and stresses of pioneer life to the fullest.

99
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:04,091
Western World is a life of lawless violence,
a society of guns and action.

100
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:09,400
This is Medieval World, where we have
reconstructed 13th-century Europe.

101
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:13,300
A world of chivalry and combat,
romance and excitement.

102
00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:17,143
Our teams of engineers have spared
no expense in this re-creation...

103
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:19,545
...precise to the smallest detail.

104
00:06:19,783 --> 00:06:21,273
Then we have Roman World:

105
00:06:21,518 --> 00:06:25,648
A lusty treat for the senses in the setting
of delightful, decadent Pompeii.

106
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:30,188
Here the traveler experiences the sensual,
relaxed morality that existed at the peak...

107
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,194
...of the Imperial Roman Empire.

108
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:34,888
All together,
these resorts comprise Delos...

109
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:37,865
...the most exciting vacation spot
in the history of man.

110
00:06:38,134 --> 00:06:40,864
This is Delos Control to Station 3.

111
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:43,600
Your negative deceleration
should be 25...

112
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:47,267
...and your ground speed should be
355 and dropping.

113
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:50,769
The whole spectrum of technology
has been employed in Delos...

114
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:52,246
...for the vacationer's pleasure.

115
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:55,342
Expensive and unusual,
Delos is not for everyone.

116
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:59,684
But for those who choose it, it is truly
a unique and rewarding experience.

117
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:13,303
We have you on Grid 5.

118
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:14,935
Notify ground crews.

119
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,814
Stand by. Locking in now.

120
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:30,416
Shut down 2, shut down 3.

121
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,824
Shut down 2, shut down 3.

122
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,655
Nice job, everybody.

123
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:01,719
Welcome to Delos.

124
00:08:03,388 --> 00:08:05,448
Please go to your color-coded tram...

125
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:08,495
...which will take you
to the world of your choice.

126
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:11,093
Give your name to the attendant.

127
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,622
Welcome to Delos.

128
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:17,294
Please go to your color-coded tram...

129
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:19,769
...which will take you
to the world of your choice.

130
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,001
May I have your name, please?

131
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:21,972
John Blane.

132
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,441
- Peter Martin.
- Thank you.

133
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:27,242
Please go to your color-coded tram
which will take you...

134
00:08:27,347 --> 00:08:29,212
...to the world of your choice.

135
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:33,980
We are sure you will enjoy your stay
in Western World.

136
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:35,248
Was she a...?

137
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:36,684
Probably.

138
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,518
That's amazing!

139
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:43,889
Supposedly, you really can't tell...
except by looking at the hands.

140
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:47,859
They haven't perfected the hands yet.

141
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:49,460
Nothing can go wrong.

142
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:52,104
You will enjoy your stay
in Roman World.

143
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,208
While you are there, please feel free
to indulge your every whim.

144
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:59,745
Medieval World exists for you, the guest.

145
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:01,939
Nothing can go wrong.

146
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:04,809
I have a quick fade on the CRT and my
balance controls don't seem to help me.

147
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:06,738
I'm keeping this in real time.

148
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:09,809
Switch me over to an on-line status
and I'll do it manually.

149
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:13,450
You've got a three-millisecond cycle delay
which should be computed in.

150
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:16,049
I don't know what to do
if the stagecoach is late.

151
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:56,993
Oh! It's fantastic!

152
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,388
I reckon that's everything.

153
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:22,586
Bath's down the hall.

154
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:25,621
Bath'll cost you
two bits for hot water.

155
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,034
Dinner at 7:00, breakfast at 6:30.

156
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:31,031
Get lunch on your own.

157
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:32,801
Couple of places in town to eat.

158
00:11:33,941 --> 00:11:36,432
Don't look like much here,
but we have everything.

159
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:37,870
Just a minute.

160
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:51,353
You mean to tell me he's a robot?

161
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:53,291
That's what I mean to tell you.

162
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:00,630
We're paying $1,000 a day for this?

163
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:02,363
It's authentic.

164
00:12:03,238 --> 00:12:05,002
The West of the 1880s.

165
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:10,204
Well, at least they could've made it
a little more comfortable.

166
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:12,445
But that's the point.

167
00:12:13,114 --> 00:12:14,809
This is really the way it was.

168
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:19,320
If you wanted comfort,
you should have stayed in Chicago.

169
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:21,920
Julie would have loved all this!

170
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,754
Poking around for hours
in all those funny shops, looking for silly...

171
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,227
What the hell is wrong with you?

172
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:28,763
You're a lawyer!

173
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:31,958
You know better than anybody else
what a ride she took you for.

174
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:33,399
Well, the kids...

175
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:35,264
Fine, the kids!

176
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:38,073
But you're here, six months later,
still thinking about her.

177
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,608
No, not really.
She just came to mind, is all.

178
00:12:48,718 --> 00:12:50,310
There's a lot to do here.

179
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:56,112
- What'll it be?
- Whiskey.

180
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,287
What about you?

181
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:01,758
Vodka martini on the rocks
with a twist of lemon. Very dry, please.

182
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:04,924
Just give him whiskey.
He's new in town.

183
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,237
You've got to get
into the feel of the thing.

184
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:13,498
I feel silly.

185
00:14:13,973 --> 00:14:15,099
Why?

186
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:17,875
It's like a joke.

187
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:23,406
It's not a joke, it's an amusement park.
It's the best amusement park in the world.

188
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:25,982
All you have to do is have fun.

189
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:30,747
There's some pretty
rough-looking customers here.

190
00:14:30,926 --> 00:14:32,222
How many of them are...?

191
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:33,555
Guests like us?

192
00:14:33,862 --> 00:14:34,850
Who knows?

193
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:37,523
That's the beauty of this place.
It doesn't matter.

194
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:41,027
It may look rough,
but it's still just a resort.

195
00:14:57,118 --> 00:15:00,316
There's no way to get hurt here.
Just enjoy yourself.

196
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:12,164
What is this stuff?

197
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:15,230
It doesn't say.

198
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:18,135
God! Give me this!

199
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:19,933
Puts hair on your chest.

200
00:15:20,476 --> 00:15:21,534
Yeah.

201
00:15:44,935 --> 00:15:46,458
Sloppy with your drink.

202
00:15:57,548 --> 00:15:59,037
Get this boy a bib.

203
00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:04,311
Go on!

204
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,461
He needs his momma.

205
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:17,098
Kill him.

206
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,307
You talk too much.

207
00:16:32,818 --> 00:16:34,376
You say something, boy?

208
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:42,014
I said, you talk too much.

209
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:52,264
Why don't you make me shut up?

210
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,922
Your move.

211
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:09,013
Pretty realistic, huh?

212
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:11,612
Listen, are you sure he was a...?

213
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:15,157
Of course. You don't really think
you shot anybody, do you?

214
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,527
Wow!

215
00:18:22,164 --> 00:18:23,358
Hey, John...

216
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:26,929
How do I know I'm not going to kill
another guest with this thing?

217
00:18:30,306 --> 00:18:31,364
Try it.

218
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:35,804
Shoot me.

219
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:39,676
Go on, shoot.

220
00:18:46,455 --> 00:18:47,445
Shoot!

221
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:52,894
The gun has a sensing device.

222
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,223
It won't fire at anything
with a high body temperature.

223
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,566
Only something cold, like a machine.

224
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:02,563
They thought of everything.

225
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,677
The Black Knight won't be repaired
till tomorrow afternoon.

226
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:16,584
Yeah, I have the banquet scheduled
for 5:30, if that conforms.

227
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,829
What do folks do for companionly
entertainment in this town?

228
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,674
I wouldn't know about such things.
I'm just runnin' this hotel.

229
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,005
Miss Carrie has a real nice saloon
down at the end of the street.

230
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:17,583
Now, I won't have talk of that woman
in this house.

231
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,242
Not over my dinner.

232
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,814
The food's real good, ma'am.

233
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:25,285
Thank you, stranger.
You're a gentleman of some breedin'.

234
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,587
Isn't she terrific?

235
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,488
Who's Miss Carrie?

236
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:20,739
You fellas new in town?

237
00:21:22,484 --> 00:21:23,473
Yep.

238
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,309
Whiskey.

239
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:27,454
Just passin' through?

240
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:30,249
Maybe.

241
00:21:30,826 --> 00:21:32,226
Lookin' for some fun?

242
00:21:35,097 --> 00:21:36,122
Maybe.

243
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:40,229
Well, you've come to the right place.
There's plenty of fun here.

244
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:43,834
That's Cindy and Arlette.

245
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:46,708
Arlette's from Paris.

246
00:21:48,444 --> 00:21:50,969
Perhaps you gentlemen
are taking a likin' to 'em.

247
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:52,404
Perhaps.

248
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:54,244
They're real accommodatin'.

249
00:21:57,354 --> 00:21:58,878
- They look it.
- Listen...

250
00:21:58,956 --> 00:22:02,391
Why don't you just go on upstairs
and we'll reckon accounts later?

251
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:06,157
- Sounds good to me.
- Are those two girls machines?

252
00:22:08,432 --> 00:22:10,525
Now, how can you say a thing like that?

253
00:22:12,102 --> 00:22:13,127
Come on.

254
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:27,342
What's goin' on?

255
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:31,010
They're robbin' the bank.

256
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:32,586
Robbin' the bank?

257
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:34,883
Hey, maybe we oughta go help out.

258
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,393
You don't know.
It might be fun to play bank robbers.

259
00:22:38,463 --> 00:22:41,092
Look, Pete, this is better.

260
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:27,707
There...

261
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,547
There is something I have to tell you.
I don't know if it matters...

262
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:35,379
...but it matters to me.

263
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:45,324
I haven't ever had a...

264
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:52,704
Well, I hardly know you,
if you know what I mean. I mean...

265
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:55,703
We just met a few minutes ago.

266
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,405
You're probably very nice.

267
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,464
I feel funny.

268
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:27,832
Why?

269
00:25:21,765 --> 00:25:23,561
I think you're very nice.

270
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:36,241
How was it? Wasn't it terrific?

271
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:39,179
Boy, machines are the servant of man!

272
00:25:39,784 --> 00:25:41,115
Wasn't that great?

273
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,881
Not bad.

274
00:25:43,256 --> 00:25:46,155
Not bad. Now you're the big lover!

275
00:25:48,592 --> 00:25:50,287
Well, you know how it is.

276
00:25:50,695 --> 00:25:52,492
Some guys have a way with women.

277
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,896
Shooting stopped.

278
00:25:58,069 --> 00:25:59,934
I guess we missed the robbery.

279
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:03,509
You can't have everything.

280
00:26:07,213 --> 00:26:08,407
John...

281
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:11,512
...this place is really fun!

282
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:56,113
I think it's the jugular unit.

283
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:06,057
- What do you think?
- Should we try and rewire her?

284
00:30:06,127 --> 00:30:09,028
No, I'd replace the whole unit
rather than try and repair it.

285
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,087
With a 10?

286
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:13,731
Use an XX-50 if we have any in stock.
The double X's have a longer lifespan.

287
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:15,565
A 50 may not fit in here.

288
00:30:16,337 --> 00:30:19,738
Maybe you can shift the integrator unit
further up into the cavity.

289
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,467
I'll try it.

290
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,716
Balance servo again?

291
00:30:28,816 --> 00:30:31,308
Yeah, she fell over this afternoon.

292
00:30:32,022 --> 00:30:33,579
I think it's the sensor.

293
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:36,353
If it's the central unit
we'll open her up.

294
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:38,689
You get a confirmation
before you do that.

295
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:44,727
What's he in for?

296
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,131
Central malfunction.

297
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:48,496
Another one?

298
00:31:05,422 --> 00:31:08,356
Since we opened the resort,
we had a failure and breakdown rate...

299
00:31:08,425 --> 00:31:10,417
...conforming to computer predictions.

300
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,190
That is 0.3 malfunctions
for each 24-hour activation period...

301
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,527
...concurrent or not.

302
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:20,066
Now, this was an anticipated operations
aspect of the resort...

303
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:22,037
...and we were fully able to handle it.

304
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:26,008
The majority of the breakdowns
were minor or peripheral...

305
00:31:26,477 --> 00:31:28,036
...until about six weeks ago.

306
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:31,440
Then Roman World had a rise
in breakdown rate...

307
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,107
...which doubled in a week.

308
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:35,612
In addition,
we saw a disproportionate rise...

309
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,519
...in central as opposed to
peripheral breakdowns.

310
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:42,322
Now, we identified some problems
with humidity control...

311
00:31:42,661 --> 00:31:44,595
...and regained homeostasis.

312
00:31:44,895 --> 00:31:48,229
Despite our corrections,
the breakdown rate continued to climb.

313
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,728
Then Medieval World began
to have trouble.

314
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:53,762
Now we're seeing
more Western World breakdowns.

315
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:57,470
And there's a clear pattern here
which suggests an analogy...

316
00:31:57,576 --> 00:32:01,603
...to an infectious disease process
spreading from one resort area to the next.

317
00:32:02,014 --> 00:32:05,415
Perhaps there are
superficial similarities to disease.

318
00:32:05,585 --> 00:32:09,681
It's only a theoretical concept.
There are many ways to order that data.

319
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:12,788
I must confess,
I find it difficult to believe in...

320
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:14,724
...a disease of machinery.

321
00:32:15,294 --> 00:32:17,319
We aren't dealing
with ordinary machines here.

322
00:32:17,397 --> 00:32:20,388
These are highly complicated
pieces of equipment...

323
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,291
...almost as complicated
as living organisms.

324
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,705
In some cases, they've been designed
by other computers.

325
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,399
We don't know exactly how they work.

326
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:41,486
Okay, up gain 437...

327
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:44,386
I'm not getting sound pickup
from the tenth quadrant.

328
00:32:46,293 --> 00:32:48,318
Okay, my telemetry is good.

329
00:32:48,897 --> 00:32:51,330
Repeat, I have good telemetry.

330
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:55,093
We have sunrise at 0.43.

331
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:57,261
Ready on all quadrants.

332
00:32:57,404 --> 00:32:58,598
Energize grid.

333
00:32:59,507 --> 00:33:00,997
Grid energized.

334
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:06,776
All right, then give me a 436,
if you can patch that in.

335
00:33:06,848 --> 00:33:08,873
If not, 435.

336
00:33:09,284 --> 00:33:12,047
I have sound now. Thank you very much.

337
00:33:12,786 --> 00:33:15,778
Yes, I want scrambled eggs and bacon
and cinnamon toast.

338
00:33:15,957 --> 00:33:18,619
Do you have cinnamon toast? You do?

339
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:21,888
Okay, send it down
to Central Control Room, Console 3.

340
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,122
Wait a minute.

341
00:33:23,232 --> 00:33:25,393
What was that? No grounding on Unit 5?

342
00:33:26,034 --> 00:33:29,664
Try a bypass.
I have readings on all units, 5 included.

343
00:33:30,306 --> 00:33:31,534
Hold on a minute.

344
00:33:32,108 --> 00:33:35,271
All right, let's stand by
for resort activation.

345
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,785
You ready on Phase 443?

346
00:33:47,491 --> 00:33:49,049
443.

347
00:33:50,726 --> 00:33:53,093
Okay, we're going to activate at 59...

348
00:33:55,966 --> 00:33:57,490
Lower gain Alpha 2...

349
00:34:01,737 --> 00:34:04,673
Ready on six, on five, on four...

350
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,404
...on three, on two. Activate now.

351
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,387
"Oh, give me a home

352
00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:01,157
"Where the buffalo roam

353
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:05,964
"And the deer and the antelope play

354
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,732
"Where seldom is heard

355
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:13,206
"A discouraging word

356
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,949
"And the skies are not cloudy all day"

357
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:46,672
What do you want?

358
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:51,043
"Home, home on the range"

359
00:35:55,522 --> 00:35:56,784
Not one word.

360
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:59,454
Do you mind if I finish shaving?

361
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:08,691
Have you no sense of...

362
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:54,146
Was he bothering you?

363
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:57,781
He isn't gonna bother you again.

364
00:36:57,853 --> 00:36:59,514
I'm here to tell you
that things have changed.

365
00:36:59,922 --> 00:37:01,355
There's law here now.

366
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,949
You can't go around plugging
whoever you please.

367
00:37:05,862 --> 00:37:07,726
But, Sheriff, it was self-defense.

368
00:37:08,032 --> 00:37:09,692
That's what they all say.

369
00:37:09,832 --> 00:37:12,597
He shot a man.
He'll have to stand trial.

370
00:37:12,936 --> 00:37:14,404
Judge'll be here next week.

371
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:17,836
If I were you,
I wouldn't trouble over your friend here.

372
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:19,637
Judge Benson likes to hang 'em.

373
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,334
Hang 'em high.

374
00:37:21,445 --> 00:37:22,605
Look, Sheriff...

375
00:37:22,713 --> 00:37:23,702
Beat it.

376
00:37:26,117 --> 00:37:27,447
I said, beat it!

377
00:37:47,305 --> 00:37:49,205
I've never been in jail before.

378
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:52,542
First time for everything.

379
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:58,313
But I haven't done anything wrong.

380
00:37:59,218 --> 00:38:01,448
You shot a man. That's something.

381
00:38:02,888 --> 00:38:04,879
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

382
00:38:06,758 --> 00:38:09,159
Well, Chicago's a long
way from here, fella.

383
00:38:10,895 --> 00:38:12,989
A thousand miles and more.

384
00:40:41,952 --> 00:40:42,977
Hold it!

385
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,051
I guess that sort of
makes us desperados.

386
00:41:14,253 --> 00:41:15,584
Yeah, I guess.

387
00:41:18,091 --> 00:41:20,582
Well, what do we do now?

388
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:23,055
The way I figure it, anything we want.

389
00:41:23,762 --> 00:41:26,060
- There's no law in that town now.
- I'll say.

390
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,993
We go in there,
and we do anything we want!

391
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,369
You know what?

392
00:41:34,307 --> 00:41:35,297
What?

393
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:37,543
I almost believe all this.

394
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,837
Why shouldn't you believe it?

395
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:41,875
It's as real as anything else.

396
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,538
Yep.

397
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,979
I reckon.

398
00:41:45,453 --> 00:41:47,011
What can you give me in Grid 7?

399
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,488
We have that on SM-514.

400
00:41:50,223 --> 00:41:52,122
Transfer, now.

401
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:55,353
Transferred.

402
00:41:55,863 --> 00:41:57,090
Reschedule.

403
00:41:57,164 --> 00:42:00,030
She wants to meet the king.
We have to restructure for that.

404
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,226
Can't disappoint a guest.

405
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:05,238
Yeah, listen, this is the third day in a row
that I've called you about my laundry.

406
00:42:05,306 --> 00:42:06,603
You've got all my shirts...

407
00:42:06,675 --> 00:42:09,269
We're rechecking the tapes
on the mechanism now.

408
00:42:10,212 --> 00:42:12,544
We have programmed infidelity
in the queen...

409
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:15,207
...as of two minutes ago.

410
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:19,118
All right,
coming up on the castle, zero...

411
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:20,748
Now.

412
00:42:20,889 --> 00:42:23,857
It also conforms with your five-year history
at this time of the year.

413
00:42:28,196 --> 00:42:29,390
Leave me now.

414
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:46,273
My queen!

415
00:42:52,422 --> 00:42:55,550
If the king should hear of this,
we would both be put to death!

416
00:42:56,192 --> 00:42:59,184
I would be more than happy
to die for you, my lady.

417
00:42:59,696 --> 00:43:01,927
Let us pray it shall not be so.

418
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:04,796
I have news.

419
00:43:05,801 --> 00:43:08,771
The Black Knight has returned,
and seeks a match with you.

420
00:43:10,273 --> 00:43:11,501
The Black Knight...?

421
00:43:11,575 --> 00:43:12,734
None other.

422
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:15,110
Is he pretty tough?

423
00:43:15,879 --> 00:43:18,973
He has the strength of ten,
and cunning besides.

424
00:43:20,784 --> 00:43:21,773
But...

425
00:43:22,252 --> 00:43:24,311
...his sight is weak in his left eye.

426
00:43:24,556 --> 00:43:27,184
Stay to his left and you will prevail
and win the day.

427
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:30,922
Confirmation of the reprogramming
of that Black Knight...

428
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:34,156
...for left lateral weakness and instability
for tomorrow.

429
00:43:34,597 --> 00:43:36,327
I shall see you on the morrow?

430
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:38,058
My lady.

431
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:11,130
Schedule for tomorrow a.m.
It's his last day in the resort.

432
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,795
Let's make it a lulu.

433
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,501
Tomorrow a.m. Broadswords.
Schedule locked.

434
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:19,543
We have a problem
with the air conditioning in Beta section.

435
00:44:19,612 --> 00:44:20,978
Send a crew out.

436
00:44:21,414 --> 00:44:23,905
Yes! He can be sheriff
any time he wants.

437
00:44:24,015 --> 00:44:26,211
That is correct.
Just give him the badge.

438
00:44:38,965 --> 00:44:41,161
Now, I'm the new law around here.

439
00:44:43,035 --> 00:44:44,970
You think you can handle things?

440
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:49,902
You wanna try me?

441
00:45:18,272 --> 00:45:19,797
A thousand pardons, my lord.

442
00:45:22,744 --> 00:45:24,541
What is your name, child?

443
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,670
Daphne.

444
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,007
Daphne.

445
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:33,247
Oh, I love this place.

446
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:35,354
I love my horse.

447
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:37,251
I love my horse and I love Julie.

448
00:45:37,325 --> 00:45:38,691
Oh, shut up, will you?

449
00:45:39,728 --> 00:45:41,592
I like the spots on my horse.

450
00:45:41,963 --> 00:45:44,456
- Did you see the spots on my horse?
- Your horse is beautiful.

451
00:45:44,532 --> 00:45:47,435
- Thank you very much. I like yours, too.
- Thank you.

452
00:45:48,904 --> 00:45:49,894
Look out!

453
00:45:50,473 --> 00:45:51,667
Let me handle this!

454
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:16,996
Goddamn it!

455
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:19,632
- Do you suppose it's real?
- Hell, no!

456
00:46:21,204 --> 00:46:22,694
That's not supposed to happen!

457
00:46:22,773 --> 00:46:25,070
Maybe it is!
Maybe it's part of the thing!

458
00:46:25,441 --> 00:46:29,378
The hell! Goddamn machines, anyway!
That's not supposed to happen!

459
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,573
A rattlesnake struck a guest?

460
00:46:32,683 --> 00:46:34,412
He was shooting at it and he missed.

461
00:46:34,485 --> 00:46:36,817
The snakes are programmed
never to hit on a strike.

462
00:46:36,887 --> 00:46:39,219
- Was the guest injured?
- Minor puncture wounds.

463
00:46:39,357 --> 00:46:41,347
It's inexcusable to injure a guest.

464
00:46:42,226 --> 00:46:44,057
Pick up that snake
for a total post at once.

465
00:46:44,129 --> 00:46:47,757
Check all the snake's central mechanisms
tonight during the repair period.

466
00:46:55,139 --> 00:46:57,370
Doesn't anything work around here?

467
00:48:14,122 --> 00:48:16,920
Logic circuits on the snake
simply failed to respond.

468
00:48:17,025 --> 00:48:19,823
There was no sign
of mechanical damage or tampering...

469
00:48:19,894 --> 00:48:21,794
...and no clue to the malfunction.

470
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:23,928
Central mechanism psychosis?

471
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:26,361
I feel we should shut down
the resort for a month.

472
00:48:26,433 --> 00:48:27,867
Oh, that seems rash.

473
00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:31,063
A snake injured a guest.
We can't allow that to happen.

474
00:48:31,272 --> 00:48:33,901
Many elements of the Delos Resort
are potentially dangerous.

475
00:48:33,976 --> 00:48:36,342
That's part of the appeal.
But if they become truly dangerous...

476
00:48:36,411 --> 00:48:37,401
I agree.

477
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:40,544
We can announce
that the resort is overbooked...

478
00:48:40,616 --> 00:48:43,483
...and not allow any further
new guests to arrive.

479
00:48:43,652 --> 00:48:45,779
We can take care of
the ones already here.

480
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:49,381
If we can't insure the safety of the guests,
we'll be in desperate trouble.

481
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:52,620
But we can insure their safety.
Everything's fine.

482
00:49:38,374 --> 00:49:41,503
All right, let's start that bar fight.

483
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:42,813
Cheat!

484
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,681
John, what do you say?

485
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:53,617
Hit me.

486
00:50:13,512 --> 00:50:15,003
Now, that's just rude!

487
00:51:08,937 --> 00:51:10,870
Hey, Sheriff! Come on!

488
00:52:45,102 --> 00:52:46,592
What's his problem?

489
00:52:46,737 --> 00:52:49,729
Nothing. He got shot up today,
so we're taking the opportunity...

490
00:52:49,807 --> 00:52:52,276
...to replace the visual cortex.

491
00:52:52,444 --> 00:52:54,435
Using the new infrared units.

492
00:52:55,013 --> 00:52:57,071
And we're increasing audio sensitivity.

493
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:03,577
You called for me, my lord?

494
00:53:03,755 --> 00:53:04,744
Yes.

495
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,193
How long have you been
in the palace, Daphne?

496
00:53:09,761 --> 00:53:11,490
Since I was three, my lord.

497
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:13,891
Charming.

498
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,199
I think we ought to get
to know each other better, Daphne.

499
00:53:18,638 --> 00:53:20,037
Better, my lord?

500
00:53:21,373 --> 00:53:23,704
I can reward you well.

501
00:53:26,778 --> 00:53:27,939
My lord...

502
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:29,608
Daphne...

503
00:53:30,984 --> 00:53:32,282
My lord!

504
00:53:32,652 --> 00:53:33,812
Daphne...

505
00:53:36,188 --> 00:53:38,317
My lord forgets himself!

506
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:42,594
Problem with the girl.
Program breakdown.

507
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:44,724
What's the trouble?

508
00:53:44,865 --> 00:53:47,094
One of the castle machines
isn't responding.

509
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,293
Refusing a guest seduction.

510
00:53:49,469 --> 00:53:51,699
Get her out of there,
and report it to central repair.

511
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:52,898
Right.

512
00:53:53,674 --> 00:53:55,198
Refusing...?

513
00:54:13,394 --> 00:54:15,692
- Did you find the trouble?
- No apparent trouble.

514
00:54:15,764 --> 00:54:17,891
But she wasn't following programming.

515
00:54:18,032 --> 00:54:20,593
She refused a guest seduction
and she is a sex model.

516
00:54:20,834 --> 00:54:22,200
Certainly is.

517
00:54:22,637 --> 00:54:23,763
Will they shut down?

518
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:27,604
No, the directors feel that to close down
now would hurt tourist confidence.

519
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,143
I don't like it.

520
00:54:37,384 --> 00:54:38,477
Breakfast.

521
00:54:57,973 --> 00:55:00,237
I'm never gonna drink again.

522
00:55:26,902 --> 00:55:28,768
Okay, 437...

523
00:55:29,072 --> 00:55:31,438
I'm not getting sound pickup
in the tenth quadrant.

524
00:55:31,509 --> 00:55:33,476
Please set numbers to console...

525
00:55:52,563 --> 00:55:53,860
Hold, varlet!

526
00:56:04,543 --> 00:56:06,066
Are you speaking to me?

527
00:56:06,178 --> 00:56:07,839
None other, sire.

528
00:56:09,114 --> 00:56:11,275
Look, I'm hungry and I...

529
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:17,611
Prepare for thy doom,
thy scurrilous knave! Huh!

530
00:56:17,756 --> 00:56:20,349
Wait a minute! Can't we talk this over?

531
00:56:20,492 --> 00:56:22,322
What, have you no spine, varlet?

532
00:56:23,228 --> 00:56:24,388
Well, I...

533
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:27,159
The queen!

534
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:32,663
Full monitor.

535
00:56:36,209 --> 00:56:37,199
Okay.

536
00:56:39,144 --> 00:56:40,169
Let him go.

537
00:57:40,076 --> 00:57:42,908
Oh, what a hangover.

538
00:58:04,367 --> 00:58:05,766
All right, varlet!

539
00:58:11,407 --> 00:58:13,376
We're losing a little tolerance.
Bring me up.

540
00:58:45,642 --> 00:58:47,769
Shut down! Shut down immediately!

541
00:58:53,217 --> 00:58:54,741
Circuits don't respond, sir!

542
00:58:55,552 --> 00:58:56,952
Then cut the robot power!

543
00:58:57,021 --> 00:58:57,885
Power cut!

544
00:58:59,992 --> 00:59:01,323
Oh, my head!

545
00:59:07,965 --> 00:59:09,228
I'm freezing!

546
00:59:14,972 --> 00:59:16,633
Gotta get to the hotel.

547
00:59:19,243 --> 00:59:20,871
I think I'm gonna be sick.

548
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:35,518
- They're not responding!
- Shall we cut the main power grid, sir?

549
00:59:35,593 --> 00:59:37,528
Shut it all down! Shut it all down!

550
00:59:48,608 --> 00:59:49,666
Hold it!

551
00:59:55,915 --> 00:59:57,542
Come on, not now.

552
00:59:58,084 --> 00:59:59,381
Not you again.

553
01:00:00,253 --> 01:00:01,515
It's too early.

554
01:00:04,525 --> 01:00:05,890
Let me do it this time.

555
01:00:09,663 --> 01:00:10,789
Your move.

556
01:00:22,442 --> 01:00:23,705
I'm shot.

557
01:00:24,145 --> 01:00:25,134
What?

558
01:00:26,013 --> 01:00:27,241
I'm shot!

559
01:00:37,993 --> 01:00:39,085
John...?

560
01:00:51,873 --> 01:00:53,067
Oh, my God!

561
01:00:56,211 --> 01:00:57,201
Draw.

562
01:01:08,257 --> 01:01:10,623
Sir, we have no control
over the robots at all!

563
01:02:21,133 --> 01:02:24,330
- They're running on stored charge!
- How long can they go?

564
01:02:24,603 --> 01:02:27,970
Some will begin to run down in an hour.
Others can go a full 12!

565
01:02:41,655 --> 01:02:44,681
- Turn the main grid back on!
- The relays must be frozen.

566
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,686
We can't get back our power!

567
01:02:46,759 --> 01:02:48,125
Hello? Hello?

568
01:03:30,906 --> 01:03:34,774
Now, how are we going to get out of here?
All these doors are electrically powered.

569
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:39,644
Now, get these doors open in here
before we all suffocate!

570
01:06:51,915 --> 01:06:54,246
Temperature elevated, 98 degrees.

571
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:57,643
Oxygen, 17 percent and dropping.

572
01:06:58,153 --> 01:07:00,485
Get that power on
so we can open these doors.

573
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:36,650
Hey!

574
01:07:37,227 --> 01:07:38,456
Don't shoot me!

575
01:07:39,663 --> 01:07:40,925
Hey, wait a minute!

576
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:45,595
What's the matter with you?

577
01:07:48,005 --> 01:07:49,336
Hold out your hands.

578
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:51,964
Let me see your hands!

579
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:57,244
You're a guest!

580
01:07:57,315 --> 01:07:58,805
You really gave me a scare.

581
01:07:58,916 --> 01:08:02,181
Look, everything's broken down.
The machines have gone crazy.

582
01:08:02,353 --> 01:08:03,843
You know about the machines?

583
01:08:04,022 --> 01:08:05,649
Yeah, I repair 'em.

584
01:08:05,724 --> 01:08:08,215
There's one chasing me now.
A gunslinger.

585
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,518
Gunslinger.

586
01:08:10,362 --> 01:08:13,296
Must be a model 404, maybe a 406.

587
01:08:13,597 --> 01:08:16,567
If he's a 406,
he's got all the sensory equipment.

588
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:18,567
It's a beautiful machine!

589
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:19,727
He's after me!

590
01:08:19,803 --> 01:08:20,897
I don't doubt it.

591
01:08:21,005 --> 01:08:21,995
What can I do?

592
01:08:22,073 --> 01:08:24,166
There's nothing you can do.
He'll get you.

593
01:08:24,243 --> 01:08:25,626
You haven't got a chance.

594
01:08:25,744 --> 01:08:27,541
There must be something!

595
01:08:27,612 --> 01:08:30,447
Fella, don't kid yourself.
There are things you could try:

596
01:08:30,616 --> 01:08:33,914
Acid for his visual system,
noise for his hearing...

597
01:08:34,921 --> 01:08:37,252
No matter what,
he'll always be one jump ahead of you!

598
01:08:37,323 --> 01:08:38,813
You haven't got a chance!

599
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:44,253
Yes, I do.

600
01:23:09,594 --> 01:23:10,959
Help me!

601
01:23:17,935 --> 01:23:19,335
Help me!

602
01:23:24,443 --> 01:23:25,909
Help me!

603
01:23:32,283 --> 01:23:33,875
Help me!

604
01:23:38,189 --> 01:23:40,055
All right. It's all right.

605
01:24:01,814 --> 01:24:02,940
- It's okay.
- Help me!

606
01:24:03,016 --> 01:24:04,414
All right, all right.

607
01:24:04,484 --> 01:24:06,452
- Help me!
- You're gonna be all right.

608
01:24:06,887 --> 01:24:08,081
Help me!

609
01:24:21,535 --> 01:24:22,763
No water...

610
01:24:23,271 --> 01:24:25,330
- Go ahead. Go ahead and drink.
- No water...

611
01:24:25,405 --> 01:24:28,203
- I'm trying to help you.
- No water. No. No!

612
01:26:43,715 --> 01:26:46,047
Why don't you make arrangements
to take our Hovercraft...

613
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:48,847
...to Medieval World, Roman World
and Westworld.

614
01:26:49,187 --> 01:26:51,883
Contact us today,
or see your travel agent.

615
01:26:52,024 --> 01:26:55,357
Boy, have we got a vacation for you,
vacation for you...

616
01:26:55,428 --> 01:26:58,057
...for you, for you, for you...
