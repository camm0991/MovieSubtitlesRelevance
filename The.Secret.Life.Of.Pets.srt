Phew! That was
a close one!

1305
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,518
Oh, nuts!

1306
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,756
Yes! We got one!

1307
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,833
Oh, good for you guys!

1308
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,638
Yay!
Yeah!

1309
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,552
Oh, yes, Tiny Dog,

1310
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,233
we got your friend!

1311
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,197
Advantage, me!

1312
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,872
(CACKLES)

1313
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,550
Uh-oh. Just ignore what
just happened. Okay?

1314
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,710
(CONTINUES CACKLING)

1315
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,915
Yes!

1316
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,113
You know what?

1317
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,555
This may be the
sausage talking,

1318
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,999
but you're okay.

1319
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,116
Right back
at you, man.

1320
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,231
When I met you,
I was all like,

1321
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,834
"I don't know
if I like him."

1322
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,150
But now that
I know you, I'm like,

1323
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,157
"I like him."
(LAUGHS)

1324
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,832
You know, I saw this
place from the outside

1325
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,353
many times.

1326
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:05,553
Had I known what treasures
awaited within these walls,

1327
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,432
I would've
broke down that door

1328
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,351
a long time ago,
I'll tell you!

1329
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,518
What are you
talking about?

1330
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,989
My old owner and I
used to live around here.

1331
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,599
Duke, man, wait.

1332
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,238
Did you used
to have an owner?

1333
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,352
Well, it was
a long time ago.

1334
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,839
I don't want
to talk about it.

1335
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,678
Yes, you do.
Come on.

1336
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,112
DUKE: I don't know.

1337
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,874
But you know what?

1338
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,950
He was so cool.

1339
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,308
Yeah?

1340
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,114
Yeah.

1341
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,111
He was the best.

(PUPPIES BARKING)

01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,639
Man, we had fun.

1344
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,073
We'd play fetch.
(BARKS)

1345
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,072
We'd go for walks.

1346
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,832
We'd take naps.

1347
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,477
We were both big nappers.

1348
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,274
I got out one night,
chasing a butterfly, or a car.

1349
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,795
By the time I had caught
up with it and ate it...

1350
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,439
Probably a butterfly,
then.

1351
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,353
...I realized I was so
far away from my home

1352
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,272
I couldn't find it.

1353
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,877
A few days later,
I was picked up by Animal Control.

1354
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,310
(SIGHING) I had
a great thing going.

1355
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,791
But I had to go
and mess it up.

1356
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,158
Duke, we gotta go
to your house.

1357
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,554
Nah.

1358
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,870
Your owner's gonna
be relieved!

1359
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,075
Will he?

1360
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,200
Yeah, but...

1361
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,316
But he never
came for me.

1362
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,639
Maybe he...

1363
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,391
Maybe he didn't like me.

1364
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,353
Of course he liked you.
He was your owner.

1365
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,750
I mean, he's probably
worried sick!

1366
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,313
I don't know.

1367
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,311
Well, I do know
and we're going!

Your owner's
gonna freak!

That rabbit...

He had crazy eyes.

There ain't no curing
what's wrong with that thing!

1381
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,555
Gidget,
here's an idea.

1382
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,673
Maybe there's a dog in the
neighborhood that looks like Max.

1383
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,671
Start hanging out with him.

1384
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,671
After a while,
you'll think it's him
