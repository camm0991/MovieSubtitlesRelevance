1
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,049
<i>I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.</i>

2
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:48,863
<i>I want my environment
to be a product of me.</i>

3
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:54,331
<i>Years ago, we had the Church.</i>

4
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,132
<i>That was only a way
of saying we had each other.</i>

5
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:03,672
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

6
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:06,041
It put hate in your heart.

7
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:09,613
<i>The Knights of Columbus were
real head-breakers.</i>

8
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:11,014
<i>True guineas.</i>

9
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:13,712
<i>They took over their piece of the city.</i>

10
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,289
<i>Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get
a fucking job...</i>

11
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:24,593
<i>...we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.</i>

12
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:28,068
<i>That's what the niggers don't realize.</i>

13
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:32,504
<i>If I got one thing
against the black chappies, it's this:</i>

14
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,803
<i>No one gives it to you.</i>

15
00:01:34,977 --> 00:01:36,877
<i>You have to take it.</i>

16
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:02,101
Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.

17
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:04,763
Won't happen again, Mr. C.

18
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:11,209
Carmen's developing
into a fine young lady.

19
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,474
You should be proud.

20
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:28,855
You get your period yet, Carmen?

21
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:46,983
You Johnny Sullivan's kid?

22
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,151
- You live with your grandmother?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:56,688
Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread,
couple half-gallons of milk.

24
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:59,421
Do you like bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.

25
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:04,159
Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?

26
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:08,028
You do good in school?

27
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,176
- Yeah.
- That's good. I did too.

28
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:15,938
They call that a paradox.

29
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:21,047
Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.

30
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:30,819
You ever wanna earn a little extra money,
you come by L Street.

31
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:33,691
You know where I am on L Street?

32
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:35,492
Good.

33
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,191
- Good boy.
- Thanks.

34
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:44,135
To you, O Lord, we commend the soul
of Alphonsus, your servant.

35
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:46,300
In the sight of this world,
he is now dead.

36
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:49,605
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

37
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:52,079
<i>- Amen.
- The Church wants you in your place.</i>

38
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,810
Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.

39
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:58,478
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

40
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,817
A man makes his own way.

41
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:02,585
No one gives it to you.

42
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,625
You have to take it.

43
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,064
- James Joyce.
- Smart, Colin.

44
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:11,699
Guineas from the North End,
down Providence...

45
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,566
...tried to tell me what to do.

46
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,506
And something maybe happened to them.

47
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:22,678
Maybe like that:

48
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:33,182
Jeez. She fell funny.

49
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:38,594
Francis, you really should see somebody.

50
00:04:38,764 --> 00:04:42,063
<i>When you decide to be something,
you can be it.</i>

51
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:45,499
That's what they don't tell you
in the Church.

52
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:50,199
When I was your age, they would say
we could become cops or criminals.

53
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,139
Today what I'm saying to you is this:

54
00:04:53,312 --> 00:04:56,873
When you're facing a loaded gun...

55
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:01,014
...what's the difference?

56
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:05,987
<i>That's my boy.</i>

57
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:09,289
Terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile...

58
00:05:09,462 --> 00:05:12,158
...as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.

59
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:15,425
Take, for instance, what you carry,
9mm hollow-point.

60
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:19,230
When the hollow-point hits the skull,
what happens is it mushrooms.

61
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:22,272
<i>When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...</i>

62
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:25,604
...ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades...

63
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:26,904
Sir, yes, sir!

64
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,516
<i>...tearing their internal organs,
their liver, their lungs, their heart...</i>

65
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:34,244
...bringing tissue, bone, blood,
brain matter, and that's called a blowback.

66
00:05:41,794 --> 00:05:44,319
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

67
00:05:44,497 --> 00:05:48,297
Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.

68
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:52,165
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.

69
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,130
Pencils.

70
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:02,175
Begin.

71
00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:11,913
What are you looking at?

72
00:06:14,694 --> 00:06:16,127
Forget it.

73
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:19,925
Your father was a janitor,
his son's only a cop.

74
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:26,203
Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.

75
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:28,167
They are.

76
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:31,903
So she tells me, "You never finish anything.
You finish the police course...

77
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:37,517
...you get taken care of again, baby."
So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.

78
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:40,517
That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderful woman.

79
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:41,711
Fuck yourself.

80
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:44,254
Put it this way.
You're a black guy in Boston.

81
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:46,984
You don't need any help from me
to be completely fucked.

82
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:50,426
The Massachusetts State Police
has a long tradition of excellence.

83
00:06:50,764 --> 00:06:54,097
Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance...

84
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:57,362
...into one of the finest law enforcement
agencies in our nation.

85
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:01,304
As the governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I am confident...

86
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:06,845
...each and every one of you will serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.

87
00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:08,948
Congratulations to all our new troopers.

88
00:07:09,116 --> 00:07:12,210
Thank you. You are dismissed.

89
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:26,425
Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out
of the gate, congratulations.

90
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,366
- We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
- No, I'll catch up with you guys.

91
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:41,305
School's out.

92
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,018
Thank you, Frank.

93
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,810
You earned it.

94
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:50,047
No more pencils, no more books.

95
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,749
All right.

96
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:55,451
<i>This is not the regular police...</i>

97
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,530
<i>- ... this is the state police.
- And fire!</i>

98
00:07:57,731 --> 00:07:59,824
<i>Your training will illustrate the difference.</i>

99
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,697
State police, search warrant!
State police, open the door!

100
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,235
<i>What's the difference?</i>

101
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:06,805
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

102
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:10,035
<i>- Is that understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

103
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,373
Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.

104
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:27,293
Congratulations on passing
the detective's exam, and welcome...

105
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:30,954
- ... to the Special Investigation Unit.
- Whoop-de-fucking-do.

106
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,999
We won't be working together,
that is, directly.

107
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:38,002
You'll be working for Captain Ellerby,
but I like to see everybody.

108
00:08:39,907 --> 00:08:42,671
You're a worker. You rise fast.

109
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:44,835
Like a 12-year-old's dick.

110
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:49,042
- Thank you, sergeant.
- My pleasure.

111
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:51,584
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

112
00:08:57,892 --> 00:09:00,986
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, hon.

113
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,790
You can go in there now.

114
00:09:12,074 --> 00:09:13,701
You can sit.

115
00:09:18,981 --> 00:09:20,380
So...

116
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,316
Do you know what we do here?
My section?

117
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:29,284
- Yes, sir, I have an idea...
- Let's say you have no idea...

118
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:31,152
...and leave it at that, okay?

119
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,818
No idea. Zip. None.

120
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,922
If you had an idea what we do, we would
not be good at what we do, would we?

121
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,624
We would be cunts.

122
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:41,827
Are you calling us cunts?

123
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:44,404
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.

124
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:47,508
I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.

125
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,137
So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

126
00:09:52,314 --> 00:09:54,839
Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

127
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:01,656
He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.

128
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:06,123
Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.

129
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:10,026
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

130
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:14,133
That's right.

131
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:16,695
- I remember his funeral.
- Oh, good.

132
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,102
Closed casket?

133
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:22,540
That's right.

134
00:10:23,112 --> 00:10:25,080
So tell anybody up at Deerfield...

135
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:28,376
Before you got kicked out for whaling
on a gym teacher with a chair.

136
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:30,951
...you had an uncle met his demise
like that?

137
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:36,892
I got a question.

138
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,119
How fucked up are you?

139
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,533
Hi, Darlene.

140
00:10:54,744 --> 00:10:58,942
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

141
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:03,919
- SIU. What a country.
- Perfect.

142
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,050
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

143
00:11:08,224 --> 00:11:11,352
You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.

144
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:14,190
We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.

145
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:19,100
All right, lookit, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.

146
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:21,365
You got any suits,
or do you like...

147
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:24,372
...coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?

148
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:29,373
You got quite the family tree.
That maggot uncle of yours...

149
00:11:29,547 --> 00:11:32,914
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns...

150
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,109
...to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

151
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:39,620
- ... from our normative behavior.
- And what's this got to do with me?

152
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,553
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

153
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:48,896
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

154
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:52,627
You have been selected for it
on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.

155
00:11:52,803 --> 00:11:55,897
This is an elite unit.

156
00:11:56,073 --> 00:12:00,339
Our job is to smash
or marginally disrupt...

157
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,570
...organized crime in this city...

158
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:05,476
...by enhanced cooperation
with the FBI...

159
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:08,412
...represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

160
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:10,747
And we will do it.

161
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:14,379
And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.

162
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,853
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.

163
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,086
Jackie met his demise.

164
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,193
Last known photograph.

165
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,825
Costello uses three key guys.

166
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:28,530
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.

167
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,403
<i>She's straight out of Going My Way.</i>

168
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:33,668
Delahunt, muscle.

169
00:12:33,844 --> 00:12:37,803
French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

170
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:40,712
We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want all ideas...

171
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,047
...so I can pass them off as my own.

172
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,348
Work hard, you'll rise fast.
You're in the best possible position...

173
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:48,287
...in the department.
Let's go to work.

174
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:50,757
Your old man was a fucking hump
from Southie.

175
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:53,897
Baggage handler at the airport, right?

176
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,532
Family's all criminals except
for the old man, huh?

177
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:59,169
And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.

178
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:03,205
Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old
boy, living on a beach in Thailand.

179
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,276
Fucking family's dug
into the Southie projects like ticks.

180
00:13:06,443 --> 00:13:08,741
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

181
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:12,782
...on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.

182
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:15,181
You were kind of a double kid,
I bet, right?

183
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:18,287
One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.

184
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:21,721
You're upper-middle class during the weeks,
then you're hanging...

185
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:24,862
...in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey...

186
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,521
...on the weekends. I got that right?

187
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,463
Yup.
You have different accents?

188
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:34,528
You did, didn't you,
you little fucking snake?

189
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:37,937
- You were like different people.
- You a psychiatrist?

190
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,078
If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.

191
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,739
And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouldn't get an answer.

192
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:49,980
Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker
like you doing in the staties?

193
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:54,481
Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?

194
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:57,287
- Who said that?
- Hawthorne.

195
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,754
What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?

196
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,100
We have a question.

197
00:14:08,274 --> 00:14:12,938
Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?

198
00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:14,409
It's an honest question.

199
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:18,242
Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

200
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,044
A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger
through a window...

201
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,018
I'm set without your
own personal job application, sergeant.

202
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,454
- What did you say?
- Sir, what do you want from me?

203
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:27,717
Hey, he can't help you.

204
00:14:27,893 --> 00:14:29,861
I know what you are.
I know what you are...

205
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:31,393
...and I know what you're not.

206
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
help you understand something.

207
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,135
You're no fucking cop.

208
00:14:38,704 --> 00:14:41,832
He's right.
We deal in deception here.

209
00:14:42,008 --> 00:14:44,841
What we do not deal with
is self-deception.

210
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:47,844
Five years from now you could be
anything else in the world.

211
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:51,609
But you will not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.

212
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:54,445
- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of that.

213
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,712
Guaran-fucking-teed.

214
00:14:58,024 --> 00:15:02,620
You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

215
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:06,726
You don't have much family.

216
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,394
I don't have any family.

217
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,409
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?

218
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:21,512
Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?

219
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:25,082
- That Stephanie?
- Yeah, that Stephanie.

220
00:15:25,252 --> 00:15:29,086
- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.
- Trying to prove something to the family?

221
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:34,250
When you say "the family,"
who do you mean exactly? You?

222
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:37,662
You always have to question everything,
don't you?

223
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,857
Maybe it would've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.

224
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:44,730
"Am I an asshole?
Are my kids a mess?

225
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:49,604
Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?"
I mean, those are questions, right?

226
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:54,542
"Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?"

227
00:15:58,752 --> 00:16:01,687
Do you need some money for the funeral?

228
00:16:04,124 --> 00:16:07,719
When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.

229
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:13,324
It's lovely. You get the high ceilings,
the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.

230
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,128
The fridge has got an alarm in it
in case you have...

231
00:16:16,303 --> 00:16:19,534
...eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.

232
00:16:19,706 --> 00:16:23,665
Well, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.

233
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:27,247
I mean, you move in,
you're upper-class by about Tuesday.

234
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:31,980
- So you're a cop.
- A state-police detective.

235
00:16:32,153 --> 00:16:33,984
A state-police detective.

236
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:37,489
And are you a married
state-police detective?

237
00:16:37,724 --> 00:16:39,157
No.

238
00:16:40,094 --> 00:16:42,756
Because this is kind of a...
Sort of a big place and...

239
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:44,954
I have a co-signer.

240
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:49,827
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend
to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.

241
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:52,301
- Yeah, it's got...
- Just give me the papers.

242
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:54,936
Sure.

243
00:16:55,409 --> 00:17:00,244
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

244
00:17:00,414 --> 00:17:02,939
- Amen.
- May she rest in peace. Amen.

245
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:06,314
May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed...

246
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:09,684
...through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

247
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:12,655
Amen.

248
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:36,081
So what do I do?

249
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:40,218
There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a regular cop...

250
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:42,482
...but there's a bonus involved.

251
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,990
Tax-free.

252
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:50,896
We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
You'll be convicted of a crime.

253
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:54,796
We're thinking a guilty plea
to assault and battery would make sense.

254
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:56,027
Given your nature.

255
00:17:56,238 --> 00:17:59,207
You'll do enough jail time
to convince anyone this is no setup.

256
00:17:59,374 --> 00:18:01,899
You'll be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink...

257
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:03,771
...the whole nine yards.

258
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:08,273
You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.

259
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:10,808
We need you, pal.

260
00:18:10,986 --> 00:18:13,853
You've already pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.

261
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:17,980
- Every weekend, sergeant.
- Perfect.

262
00:18:19,695 --> 00:18:21,492
Do it again.

263
00:18:22,664 --> 00:18:24,325
For me.

264
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:01,569
- Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

265
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:04,638
Well, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

266
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:08,140
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.

267
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:10,973
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.

268
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:29,828
- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.

269
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:32,933
- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?

270
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:36,094
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

271
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,439
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

272
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,874
I got kicked out, like, four months ago.

273
00:19:43,046 --> 00:19:45,276
Yeah, it was in the papers.

274
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:48,811
So you know.

275
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:51,818
And why are we graced
with your presence?

276
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:54,790
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

277
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,086
- Look at the smile.
- My mother had them. My...

278
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:00,890
My mother's dead.

279
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:05,458
I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.

280
00:20:05,635 --> 00:20:08,195
I was at a funeral myself, man.

281
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:11,373
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

282
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,804
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

283
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:18,140
- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.

284
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,640
I got, like...

285
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:25,276
- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.

286
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:28,219
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

287
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:31,054
In your line of work, if I gave you...

288
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:34,925
...like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

289
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:38,464
You know what you...

290
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:40,966
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

291
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:45,234
- What? What?
- Come on, man.

292
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:49,310
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

293
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:51,106
What, you want me to say it?

294
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:57,820
I'm not a cop, all right?

295
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:02,155
- I'm your fucking cousin.
- You're bad.

296
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,120
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

297
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,858
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

298
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:14,562
If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

299
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:18,208
<i>R is for Ricans
P is for pigs</i>

300
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,469
Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

301
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:24,614
That's right. You used to be a cop.

302
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:28,217
When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.

303
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:31,844
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.

304
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:33,456
This side of Worcester.

305
00:21:34,191 --> 00:21:37,354
- Says who?
- Says him. Says Costello.

306
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:39,519
God says, as far as you're...

307
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,529
...concerned.

308
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,571
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

309
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,105
- Cunt cop.
- No, no, no.

310
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:53,038
He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.

311
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,678
Well, I knew his father.

312
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,574
- I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
- Jackie was all right.

313
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,241
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

314
00:22:01,418 --> 00:22:03,386
Fucking guineas.

315
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,055
- To Jackie.
- Uncle Jackie.

316
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,316
Cranberry juice.

317
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,656
It's a natural diuretic.

318
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,028
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

319
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,133
What, do you got your period?

320
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:25,775
- Fucking...!
- Get off!

321
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,578
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

322
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,644
Do you know me?

323
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,683
No. No.

324
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,057
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit...

325
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,218
...and there's guys you can't.

326
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,387
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

327
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:48,828
...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

328
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,663
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:

329
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,863
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

330
00:22:57,675 --> 00:23:00,235
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.

331
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:05,341
I fucking know you. I know your family.

332
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,476
You make one more drug deal...

333
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:10,486
...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

334
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,952
...and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

335
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:17,219
I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

336
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,129
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

337
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,560
What are you drinking?

338
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,538
A cranberry juice.

339
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,008
What is it, your period?

340
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:44,284
Get him a cranberry juice.

341
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,854
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.

342
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,696
What? "Oh," fucking what?

343
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:01,838
Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,675
Sorry I'm late.

345
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,777
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.

346
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,538
His undercover work is extensive.

347
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:10,945
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

348
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,346
Okay, my people are out there.

349
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,079
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

350
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:18,690
You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

351
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,690
You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.

352
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,795
Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.

353
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:27,229
- Fuck yourself.
- I'm tired from fucking your wife.

354
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,664
- How's your mother?
- Tired from fucking my father.

355
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,669
Good. Today, girls...

356
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,738
...what I have is microprocessors.

357
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:38,240
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors...

358
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:40,971
...from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

359
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,410
These are the kind
they put into computers...

360
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,416
...that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

361
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,417
...from a couple hundred miles away.

362
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:51,421
These pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece.

363
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:54,151
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

364
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,262
...walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

365
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,489
...has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday...

366
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,032
...but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

367
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:04,363
You know where that dirtball
started his life?

368
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:06,095
Southie projects.

369
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:08,935
- What was his name, the departed?
- Myles Kennefick.

370
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:12,135
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

371
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:14,041
- ... which happens to...
- South Boston?

372
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:17,274
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

373
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,647
His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

374
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,549
We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.

375
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,158
We're here to nail Costello.

376
00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:28,794
All right, look. We got a guy...

377
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:31,488
...says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

378
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:34,134
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

379
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:36,701
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

380
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:40,307
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the Bureau.

381
00:25:40,508 --> 00:25:44,205
Without asking for too many details,
do you have anyone in with Costello now?

382
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:46,977
Maybe. Maybe not.

383
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:48,843
Maybe fuck yourself.

384
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:51,348
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

385
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,419
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

386
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:55,213
You girls have a good day.

387
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:59,686
Normally he's a very nice guy.

388
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,760
Don't judge him from this meeting alone.

389
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:07,995
Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.

390
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:09,898
I knew Myles.

391
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:12,904
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

392
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,234
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

393
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:18,401
Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people...

394
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:21,412
...who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

395
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:23,414
Allegedly.

396
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:25,580
Allegedly.

397
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:28,221
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

398
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,358
But not the robbery. That's not wrong.

399
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:32,583
He did something else wrong?

400
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:37,888
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

401
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:41,929
I mean, fuck yourself.

402
00:26:43,572 --> 00:26:46,040
- Did you get that?
- "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?

403
00:26:46,207 --> 00:26:49,643
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Different breed down here, sarge.

404
00:26:51,145 --> 00:26:52,612
I need a cup of coffee.

405
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:08,625
You making a house call?

406
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:11,254
Have I seen you professionally?

407
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:14,925
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

408
00:27:15,103 --> 00:27:18,766
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty...

409
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,535
...and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.

410
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:26,545
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.

411
00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:28,376
I have an appointment on this floor.

412
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:32,008
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.

413
00:27:32,187 --> 00:27:34,280
- I'm one more up.
- Oh, fancy policeman.

414
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:36,549
- Yeah, that's right, fancy.
- Are you a statie?

415
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:39,853
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

416
00:27:40,028 --> 00:27:41,325
Suffolk, nights?

417
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:44,363
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

418
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:48,026
- When's the last time you checked?
- Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

419
00:27:48,204 --> 00:27:50,968
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insulting you.

420
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:53,801
Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

421
00:27:53,975 --> 00:27:56,773
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.

422
00:27:56,946 --> 00:28:02,043
I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

423
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:04,447
That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.

424
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,646
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.

425
00:28:07,824 --> 00:28:09,314
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

426
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:22,932
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.

427
00:28:23,105 --> 00:28:25,938
No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't...

428
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:29,235
All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

429
00:28:29,411 --> 00:28:32,539
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.

430
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:34,012
All right, have a nice day.

431
00:28:35,284 --> 00:28:37,013
Cut him here.

432
00:28:37,787 --> 00:28:39,254
Bye-bye.

433
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:44,517
Jerk-ass!

434
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:47,356
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.

435
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:51,057
Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

436
00:28:51,234 --> 00:28:54,203
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

437
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,861
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?

438
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,065
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

439
00:29:00,243 --> 00:29:01,471
I'm trying to help you.

440
00:29:01,644 --> 00:29:05,080
You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

441
00:29:05,248 --> 00:29:08,706
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.

442
00:29:08,886 --> 00:29:12,344
See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.

443
00:29:12,523 --> 00:29:15,356
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

444
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:17,959
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

445
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:20,994
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

446
00:29:21,163 --> 00:29:23,393
These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?

447
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:25,797
Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

448
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:29,062
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Know what I'm saying?

449
00:29:29,238 --> 00:29:30,762
You fellas come from Providence?

450
00:29:30,941 --> 00:29:33,000
It isn't any of your business, is it, now?

451
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:35,700
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

452
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:48,718
Hey! You are killing my business, man!

453
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:50,652
Fuck!

454
00:29:50,827 --> 00:29:53,990
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

455
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:01,270
Get out of here. Get out of here!

456
00:30:07,911 --> 00:30:11,608
- Now, you also do probation work, right?
- That's right, I see violent offenders.

457
00:30:11,782 --> 00:30:15,843
- Oh, bad guys.
- Not necessarily.

458
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:24,493
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.

459
00:30:24,662 --> 00:30:26,220
Was your meal okay?

460
00:30:26,396 --> 00:30:27,954
Yeah, no, the lobster was good.

461
00:30:28,132 --> 00:30:31,533
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

462
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,037
I'm waiting for you to make your move.

463
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,145
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

464
00:30:42,312 --> 00:30:43,677
I don't even know what it is.

465
00:30:50,989 --> 00:30:53,787
So what's it like having people
find themselves...

466
00:30:53,957 --> 00:30:55,822
...in your office all day long?

467
00:30:55,994 --> 00:30:58,622
Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?

468
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:02,330
Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?

469
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,899
- No, no, no.
- No?

470
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:06,400
No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.

471
00:31:07,772 --> 00:31:09,967
Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

472
00:31:10,141 --> 00:31:11,540
Yeah, I do.

473
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,874
Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.

474
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:18,680
Who says I wanna see you again?

475
00:31:22,553 --> 00:31:24,316
Don't you?

476
00:31:26,057 --> 00:31:27,957
- You should see your face.
- Don't you?

477
00:31:28,126 --> 00:31:29,559
Course I wanna see you again.

478
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:32,286
What Freud said about the Irish is...

479
00:31:32,464 --> 00:31:36,730
...we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

480
00:31:37,702 --> 00:31:40,034
- Yeah, he said that.
- I know he did.

481
00:31:40,205 --> 00:31:43,368
So you're up shit's creek with a client list
full of mick cops.

482
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:45,532
I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.

483
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,871
Why do you do it, then?

484
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,207
Some people do get better.

485
00:31:54,218 --> 00:31:55,549
Fair enough.

486
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:59,418
Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

487
00:32:00,392 --> 00:32:01,620
Including the criminals?

488
00:32:01,793 --> 00:32:04,057
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

489
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:07,957
I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.

490
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:11,961
- Wait. You are trouble.
- You don't know the half of it.

491
00:32:12,137 --> 00:32:14,230
I'll arrest you right now.

492
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:17,341
<i>My word against yours.</i>

493
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:21,436
...then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.

494
00:32:22,748 --> 00:32:24,648
I say, "Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?"

495
00:32:24,816 --> 00:32:28,843
He goes, "Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners," so...

496
00:32:31,523 --> 00:32:33,923
So I say to him,
"Princess Carolina of Monaco..."

497
00:32:36,628 --> 00:32:37,959
Schuyler.

498
00:32:51,643 --> 00:32:53,941
Do you know who I am?

499
00:32:57,182 --> 00:32:58,706
No.

500
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:07,055
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

501
00:33:17,202 --> 00:33:19,727
His real name Mr. French?

502
00:33:22,642 --> 00:33:24,303
No.

503
00:33:27,914 --> 00:33:29,882
Come with me.

504
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,686
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

505
00:33:40,793 --> 00:33:45,355
You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.

506
00:33:45,532 --> 00:33:49,400
And this can cause me a lot of problems.

507
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:58,308
Those guys you tuned up...

508
00:33:58,478 --> 00:34:00,639
...they're connected down Providence.

509
00:34:02,148 --> 00:34:03,547
What they're gonna do...

510
00:34:03,716 --> 00:34:07,311
...is come back with some guys
and kill you.

511
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:10,513
Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.

512
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,090
Unless I stop them.

513
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,327
Do you want me to stop them?

514
00:34:18,464 --> 00:34:20,694
Is this something I can't do personally?

515
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:26,369
I'm gonna have my associate search you.

516
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:28,837
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

517
00:34:29,008 --> 00:34:31,738
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

518
00:34:32,313 --> 00:34:33,780
Shoes.

519
00:34:40,421 --> 00:34:41,911
I knew your father.

520
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:48,222
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

521
00:34:49,095 --> 00:34:52,064
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

522
00:34:52,832 --> 00:34:55,892
- Stand.
- He didn't complain.

523
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,800
Yeah, that was his problem.

524
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,805
Who said he had a problem?

525
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,635
I just said he had a fucking problem.

526
00:35:06,947 --> 00:35:09,279
There's a man could've been anything.

527
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,850
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

528
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:15,455
- Fuck.
- I'm saying he worked at the airport.

529
00:35:15,623 --> 00:35:17,488
- He's clean.
- Arm.

530
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:18,920
Yeah, come on.

531
00:35:19,093 --> 00:35:20,617
What arm? What fucking arm?

532
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:24,127
Show me your arm. Flip it.

533
00:35:30,938 --> 00:35:34,465
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

534
00:35:36,211 --> 00:35:37,542
He's clean.

535
00:35:37,711 --> 00:35:40,976
And if I can slander my own
environment...

536
00:35:41,148 --> 00:35:44,948
...it makes me sad, this regression.

537
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,079
Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan...

538
00:35:50,257 --> 00:35:54,557
...to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

539
00:35:55,297 --> 00:35:57,663
I just can't know.

540
00:35:58,132 --> 00:36:02,330
I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.

541
00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:06,732
- Are you still a cop?
- No! No!

542
00:36:07,275 --> 00:36:10,244
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

543
00:36:10,412 --> 00:36:13,245
I am not a fucking cop!

544
00:36:14,182 --> 00:36:19,085
Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?

545
00:36:19,254 --> 00:36:22,382
Yes. Yes, yes.

546
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:25,585
All right, all right, all right.

547
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,558
You're okay. You'll be all right.

548
00:36:29,097 --> 00:36:31,964
Get your hand taken care of.

549
00:36:33,034 --> 00:36:37,596
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

550
00:36:38,873 --> 00:36:42,502
As for our problem with Providence...

551
00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:46,143
...let's not cry over spilled guineas.

552
00:36:48,683 --> 00:36:51,652
Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

553
00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:59,256
Just kidding. How's your mother?

554
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:01,663
She's on her way out.

555
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,890
We all are. Act accordingly.

556
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,430
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

557
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:09,764
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

558
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:13,032
- What's got you all hot and bothered?
- Get in the car. You'll see.

559
00:37:13,908 --> 00:37:16,536
Do you trust him?

560
00:37:17,178 --> 00:37:18,406
Well, these days...

561
00:37:19,148 --> 00:37:20,706
...who's reliable?

562
00:37:21,249 --> 00:37:23,217
His Uncle Jackie was.

563
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:28,379
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.

564
00:37:33,228 --> 00:37:35,025
I'm reliable.

565
00:37:35,831 --> 00:37:39,267
Arnold, you're one in a million.

566
00:37:39,435 --> 00:37:42,097
Ten. Ten million.

567
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,736
What about your wife, Arnold?

568
00:37:49,245 --> 00:37:50,803
Well, I thought she was.

569
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:54,078
She wasn't.

570
00:37:56,386 --> 00:37:58,251
Well, she got reliable.

571
00:38:00,357 --> 00:38:03,383
Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?

572
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:06,586
Another county heard from.

573
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:08,491
One too many. She got a big mouth.

574
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:10,757
Answer this for me, will you?

575
00:38:31,588 --> 00:38:35,149
The principles of detection tell me
these two gentlemen came from Providence.

576
00:38:35,325 --> 00:38:39,022
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd
appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.

577
00:38:39,196 --> 00:38:41,960
Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.

578
00:38:42,132 --> 00:38:43,599
Thanks.

579
00:38:45,569 --> 00:38:50,097
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.

580
00:38:50,273 --> 00:38:52,070
Can I meet you for lunch?

581
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:53,504
All right, see you then.

582
00:38:57,948 --> 00:38:59,711
Who's the lead detective?

583
00:38:59,883 --> 00:39:02,716
Good. He's a lox.

584
00:39:10,861 --> 00:39:14,957
Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas
for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...

585
00:39:15,132 --> 00:39:16,861
<i>...and he'll say so.</i>

586
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:21,333
Look in his car, you'll find the gun
that did it, registered, official. Providence.

587
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:23,700
In the trunk or the glove compartment?

588
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:27,033
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

589
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,978
Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the 6:00 news.

590
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:36,450
No wonder you get ahead.

591
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,685
Have a seat, Bill.

592
00:39:52,403 --> 00:39:54,837
Do you know John Lennon?

593
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.

594
00:40:01,546 --> 00:40:03,673
Lennon said:

595
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:06,110
"I'm an artist.

596
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:10,687
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it."

597
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,290
I tell you, Mr. Costello...

598
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,725
...I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

599
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:29,503
Smart-mouth.

600
00:40:30,441 --> 00:40:32,341
Too bad.

601
00:40:33,544 --> 00:40:35,842
If you'll indulge me...

602
00:40:37,748 --> 00:40:38,737
Now what?

603
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:42,219
Choir practice.

604
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:44,585
Choir practice...

605
00:40:49,427 --> 00:40:51,861
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

606
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:56,763
...a man could look at anything...

607
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:58,595
...and make something out of it.

608
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,237
For instance...

609
00:41:00,405 --> 00:41:02,805
...I look at you and I think:

610
00:41:03,742 --> 00:41:06,142
What could I use you for?

611
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,141
Get rid of this.

612
00:41:10,315 --> 00:41:11,805
French.

613
00:41:11,984 --> 00:41:14,452
<i>Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.</i>

614
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,315
Maybe we could work something out.

615
00:41:17,154 --> 00:41:20,453
- Good.
- And send this to his wife.

616
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,593
It was nice the way
you asked the guy...

617
00:41:22,761 --> 00:41:24,991
...which hand he jerked off with.

618
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:27,098
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

619
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:30,933
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.

620
00:41:39,044 --> 00:41:41,808
That was quick.
You think he's dead already?

621
00:41:42,614 --> 00:41:44,673
<i>We have to do it by phone.
I won't do it...</i>

622
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,114
...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

623
00:41:47,286 --> 00:41:49,686
<i>- You don't know what this is like.
- Microprocessors.</i>

624
00:41:49,855 --> 00:41:52,153
<i>- Micro what?
- Microprocessors.</i>

625
00:41:52,325 --> 00:41:55,192
We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years...

626
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,295
...and Costello is selling them
military technology.

627
00:41:58,463 --> 00:42:00,863
Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.

628
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:03,297
<i>Anybody says anything about
anything like that...</i>

629
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:04,458
...you let us know.

630
00:42:08,441 --> 00:42:10,636
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

631
00:42:11,544 --> 00:42:13,307
Jimmy Pappas.

632
00:42:13,478 --> 00:42:15,469
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

633
00:42:16,748 --> 00:42:18,943
Jimmy had a rough month.

634
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:21,449
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...

635
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,817
...and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

636
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,821
I believe it's been in the papers.

637
00:42:28,094 --> 00:42:30,028
You seem quite happy with that result.

638
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:33,191
It's a fucking result.

639
00:42:33,365 --> 00:42:36,630
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

640
00:42:36,802 --> 00:42:39,828
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

641
00:42:42,241 --> 00:42:45,074
I think you are a cop, my son.

642
00:42:46,779 --> 00:42:48,406
- Where's your license?
- What license?

643
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,515
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.

644
00:42:51,684 --> 00:42:54,812
But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.

645
00:42:54,987 --> 00:42:58,388
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

646
00:42:58,558 --> 00:43:01,083
That means you're bringing
undesirable elements...

647
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,194
...into Mr. Costello's area.

648
00:43:08,568 --> 00:43:11,128
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

649
00:43:11,304 --> 00:43:12,328
Hey.

650
00:43:14,307 --> 00:43:15,604
That's Jimmy Bags.

651
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,510
- He was rea... I don't know.
- What the fuck you doing?

652
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,311
I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.

653
00:43:25,485 --> 00:43:27,282
There's no profit, I pay him two grand.

654
00:43:27,454 --> 00:43:29,354
Then make more money.
This is America.

655
00:43:29,522 --> 00:43:32,821
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

656
00:43:32,992 --> 00:43:35,620
- Make more money.
- That's the spirit!

657
00:43:35,796 --> 00:43:37,889
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry about it.

658
00:43:38,064 --> 00:43:40,589
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

659
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,894
It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.

660
00:43:44,071 --> 00:43:46,938
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.

661
00:43:47,107 --> 00:43:51,339
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim...

662
00:43:52,146 --> 00:43:53,238
Hi, Captain.

663
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:54,608
This crazy fuck...

664
00:43:54,782 --> 00:43:56,909
- ... knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
- So?

665
00:43:57,084 --> 00:43:59,177
- He was...
- He was reaching for his cigarettes.

666
00:43:59,353 --> 00:44:02,186
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasn't for no reason, Frank.

667
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:03,618
He reached into his coat.

668
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:06,021
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

669
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:08,627
Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

670
00:44:08,796 --> 00:44:10,855
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

671
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:13,295
Queenan's compartmentalizing
everything in SIU...

672
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:14,798
...which is the right thing.

673
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:17,596
I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.

674
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:20,005
Bottom line...

675
00:44:20,175 --> 00:44:22,268
...we think we might have a problem.

676
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:25,310
We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.

677
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,380
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

678
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,848
Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?

679
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,614
No, no, not presently.

680
00:44:34,788 --> 00:44:36,221
But I'm working on that.

681
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,517
Here, Bill, this is for you.

682
00:44:39,194 --> 00:44:42,823
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

683
00:44:42,997 --> 00:44:46,489
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

684
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,566
You wait. We'll call you.

685
00:44:49,736 --> 00:44:51,397
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got that.

686
00:44:51,573 --> 00:44:54,508
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- I got that.

687
00:44:54,676 --> 00:44:56,303
Good.

688
00:44:57,811 --> 00:44:59,676
Hi, Dad.

689
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,644
I got promoted. All right.

690
00:45:20,201 --> 00:45:22,169
Excuse me for one second.

691
00:45:23,271 --> 00:45:25,068
You know...

692
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:28,707
...if your father were alive...

693
00:45:28,877 --> 00:45:30,936
...and saw you here sitting with me...

694
00:45:31,112 --> 00:45:33,376
...let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

695
00:45:33,548 --> 00:45:36,346
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

696
00:45:36,518 --> 00:45:38,748
And he could do it...

697
00:45:39,354 --> 00:45:43,222
...which is maybe something
you don't know about William Costigan Sr.

698
00:45:47,997 --> 00:45:52,593
- So he never...? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.

699
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:56,259
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

700
00:45:56,437 --> 00:45:58,735
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

701
00:45:59,808 --> 00:46:01,435
Your Uncle Jackie...

702
00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:06,376
...he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

703
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,977
And I think about this.

704
00:46:16,891 --> 00:46:19,587
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

705
00:46:20,395 --> 00:46:23,296
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

706
00:46:23,465 --> 00:46:25,490
School?

707
00:46:27,503 --> 00:46:30,233
With all due respect, Mr. Costello...

708
00:46:30,406 --> 00:46:32,499
...school is out.

709
00:46:33,242 --> 00:46:36,006
Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.

710
00:46:37,813 --> 00:46:39,075
Good day, Fathers.

711
00:46:40,281 --> 00:46:43,250
- Mr. Costello.
- Good morning, Francis, good morning.

712
00:46:43,419 --> 00:46:46,081
You recall our chat?

713
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:48,481
Little boys...

714
00:46:48,924 --> 00:46:53,088
...sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...

715
00:46:53,696 --> 00:46:56,096
"I am as God made me."
Was that your rationale?

716
00:46:58,167 --> 00:47:03,503
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

717
00:47:03,673 --> 00:47:07,700
May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.

718
00:47:10,212 --> 00:47:13,181
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

719
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:16,750
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

720
00:47:17,553 --> 00:47:19,714
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

721
00:47:19,889 --> 00:47:21,584
Pay them.

722
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:25,953
Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.

723
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:35,896
- What do you got for me?
- Uniform clipped him for suspended license.

724
00:47:36,072 --> 00:47:38,438
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation...

725
00:47:38,608 --> 00:47:40,542
More than one. He's one of Costello's.

726
00:47:40,709 --> 00:47:43,269
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

727
00:47:43,446 --> 00:47:46,108
He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

728
00:47:46,282 --> 00:47:48,910
- Who's the lawyer?
- Didn't know the name. Just a number.

729
00:47:49,653 --> 00:47:51,052
Beeper number.

730
00:47:51,755 --> 00:47:54,053
- And the guy didn't show up?
- No.

731
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:57,423
- And he beeped him?
- Twice.

732
00:48:01,665 --> 00:48:04,133
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

733
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,427
- What?
- Turn the fucking camera off.

734
00:48:06,936 --> 00:48:10,030
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.

735
00:48:10,206 --> 00:48:12,265
Whose briefcase is this? All right.

736
00:48:12,442 --> 00:48:13,704
- It's off?
- You're good.

737
00:48:13,877 --> 00:48:16,539
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

738
00:48:16,846 --> 00:48:19,041
- He can't do that.
- He just did.

739
00:48:19,215 --> 00:48:22,673
- You my attorney?
- What do you think?

740
00:48:23,854 --> 00:48:25,845
Have you made statements
or phone calls...

741
00:48:26,022 --> 00:48:27,683
...I need to be made aware of?

742
00:48:29,759 --> 00:48:32,387
I beeped you.

743
00:48:32,629 --> 00:48:35,689
The card they gave me. That's it.

744
00:48:35,866 --> 00:48:39,267
- That's it?
- That's it.

745
00:48:42,473 --> 00:48:43,906
You need to call your mother...

746
00:48:44,075 --> 00:48:46,373
...tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

747
00:48:51,082 --> 00:48:54,609
Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.

748
00:48:57,888 --> 00:49:01,221
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

749
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:04,986
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

750
00:49:06,997 --> 00:49:08,521
So make the call.

751
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:16,628
Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me...

752
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:20,704
...just listen to what I'm saying to you.

753
00:49:37,495 --> 00:49:41,989
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

754
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:44,100
<i>Sorry, yeah, I got held up.</i>

755
00:49:45,636 --> 00:49:48,571
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

756
00:49:49,607 --> 00:49:52,838
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

757
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:54,773
Bye.

758
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,177
Everybody out. Move.

759
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,528
Thank you.

760
00:50:17,836 --> 00:50:19,269
So who are you?

761
00:50:19,437 --> 00:50:22,873
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

762
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:24,702
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

763
00:50:24,876 --> 00:50:28,209
All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.

764
00:50:28,379 --> 00:50:31,075
I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there...

765
00:50:31,249 --> 00:50:33,342
...and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

766
00:50:33,518 --> 00:50:36,885
- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.

767
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,865
The light's nice here in the morning.

768
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,468
So do you wanna talk about last night?

769
00:51:04,116 --> 00:51:07,643
You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make
too big a deal out of it.

770
00:51:13,225 --> 00:51:15,159
It's actually quite common.

771
00:51:15,328 --> 00:51:16,920
I gotta go to work.

772
00:51:26,138 --> 00:51:27,969
Do you lie?

773
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:31,866
Why? Do you?

774
00:51:32,044 --> 00:51:33,739
No, I'm asking if you lie.

775
00:51:34,814 --> 00:51:37,214
Honesty is not synonymous with truth.

776
00:51:37,383 --> 00:51:39,476
Yeah, you lie.

777
00:51:39,652 --> 00:51:40,812
You lie.

778
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,645
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally...

779
00:51:43,823 --> 00:51:45,882
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?

780
00:51:46,525 --> 00:51:51,485
Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.

781
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:56,925
So you had a parent who was a drunk.

782
00:52:00,806 --> 00:52:02,535
Did you?

783
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:04,335
No.

784
00:52:06,646 --> 00:52:08,409
Let's keep it with you.

785
00:52:08,581 --> 00:52:11,175
Talk about how you feel.

786
00:52:12,985 --> 00:52:15,283
<i>How I feel.</i>

787
00:52:15,455 --> 00:52:17,355
<i>How I feel.</i>

788
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:39,940
- Fuck.
- Brian, stop it.

789
00:52:45,217 --> 00:52:48,152
No. Please. No.

790
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:50,118
Ain't gonna hurt you.

791
00:52:53,627 --> 00:52:54,958
<i>You sit there...</i>

792
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:57,358
...with a mass murderer.

793
00:52:57,597 --> 00:52:59,326
A mass murderer.

794
00:52:59,499 --> 00:53:02,696
Your heart rate is jacked.

795
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:05,499
And your hand...

796
00:53:07,174 --> 00:53:08,573
...steady.

797
00:53:10,978 --> 00:53:15,278
That's one thing I figured out about myself
in prison. My hand...

798
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:17,644
...does not shake.

799
00:53:18,452 --> 00:53:19,942
Ever.

800
00:53:28,795 --> 00:53:30,922
Wake the fuck up.

801
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,391
There was a cop leaving when I came in.

802
00:53:35,803 --> 00:53:37,771
How did you know he was a cop?

803
00:53:37,938 --> 00:53:42,739
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

804
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:45,071
- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.

805
00:53:45,245 --> 00:53:48,442
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

806
00:53:48,615 --> 00:53:51,846
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

807
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:54,380
Should I?

808
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:58,022
So do they all come in here...

809
00:53:58,192 --> 00:54:00,422
...and cry, your cops?

810
00:54:00,927 --> 00:54:03,896
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

811
00:54:04,064 --> 00:54:07,261
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons...

812
00:54:07,435 --> 00:54:09,562
Use their weapons?

813
00:54:10,104 --> 00:54:11,571
Let me tell you something.

814
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:14,037
They signed up to use their weapons.

815
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:16,676
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

816
00:54:16,844 --> 00:54:19,745
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

817
00:54:19,914 --> 00:54:22,940
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

818
00:54:23,117 --> 00:54:24,914
Except for a cop on TV.

819
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,260
<i>I looked at your file.</i>

820
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,957
I see that you have a record of assault.

821
00:54:38,132 --> 00:54:39,656
Yeah.

822
00:54:39,935 --> 00:54:41,960
<i>So what was it like for you in jail?</i>

823
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:46,602
What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

824
00:54:46,774 --> 00:54:48,605
Did something happen to you?

825
00:54:48,976 --> 00:54:50,409
No.

826
00:54:52,613 --> 00:54:57,073
- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.
- Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

827
00:54:57,251 --> 00:55:00,652
...and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

828
00:55:00,822 --> 00:55:03,723
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.

829
00:55:03,892 --> 00:55:06,258
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.

830
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,020
It's been a year. I've had enough!

831
00:55:08,196 --> 00:55:11,324
Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?

832
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,628
- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.

833
00:55:14,803 --> 00:55:17,169
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

834
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:20,900
We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

835
00:55:21,076 --> 00:55:23,101
How about we just erase your file, huh?

836
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,041
How about we erase your file...

837
00:55:25,214 --> 00:55:27,648
...and you're just
another soldier for Costello...

838
00:55:27,816 --> 00:55:31,047
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?

839
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:34,815
How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!

840
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:37,117
- That was a joke. Come on.
- That wasn't a joke.

841
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,522
You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

842
00:55:39,695 --> 00:55:45,065
- ... you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

843
00:55:45,234 --> 00:55:49,136
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

844
00:55:49,905 --> 00:55:51,998
For chrissake, be smart.

845
00:55:52,174 --> 00:55:55,473
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

846
00:55:55,645 --> 00:55:57,203
Come on, get in the car.

847
00:55:57,379 --> 00:55:59,745
Both of you, get in the car.

848
00:56:02,017 --> 00:56:03,712
When are you gonna take Costello?

849
00:56:03,887 --> 00:56:06,014
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

850
00:56:06,188 --> 00:56:09,487
...of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?

851
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:11,353
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

852
00:56:11,528 --> 00:56:14,463
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

853
00:56:14,631 --> 00:56:18,328
What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

854
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:20,196
- That what you want?
- That'd stick.

855
00:56:20,369 --> 00:56:22,132
Will you shut up?

856
00:56:22,305 --> 00:56:24,671
We are building a case and it takes time.

857
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,068
You know that.

858
00:56:27,377 --> 00:56:29,242
Something's wrong.

859
00:56:30,013 --> 00:56:31,844
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

860
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,442
Yeah, maybe.

861
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:38,748
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?

862
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:40,918
No bullshit.

863
00:56:41,457 --> 00:56:44,620
I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.

864
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,054
You serious?

865
00:56:49,232 --> 00:56:51,029
I'm afraid so.

866
00:56:55,038 --> 00:56:57,598
Have you heard anything like that?

867
00:56:57,774 --> 00:56:59,435
Jesus Christ.

868
00:57:01,644 --> 00:57:03,475
Hang tight for me, kid.

869
00:57:03,647 --> 00:57:05,444
Just a little while longer.

870
00:57:05,615 --> 00:57:07,913
We are this close:

871
00:57:09,986 --> 00:57:11,715
All right?

872
00:57:13,022 --> 00:57:14,751
<i>What do you expect coming in here?</i>

873
00:57:14,924 --> 00:57:17,722
- I have to come here.
- I know you have to come here.

874
00:57:18,294 --> 00:57:20,819
But now that you're here...

875
00:57:21,097 --> 00:57:22,894
...what do you want?

876
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,733
You want the truth?

877
00:57:27,037 --> 00:57:28,595
Valium.

878
00:57:28,938 --> 00:57:32,066
If you lied, you would have an easier time
getting what you wanted.

879
00:57:32,242 --> 00:57:35,643
- What's that say about what you do?
- We should have a few more meetings...

880
00:57:35,813 --> 00:57:39,510
- ... before we even talk about prescriptions.
- Look, I'm having panic attacks.

881
00:57:39,683 --> 00:57:44,017
Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.

882
00:57:44,187 --> 00:57:45,779
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

883
00:57:45,956 --> 00:57:47,480
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

884
00:57:47,658 --> 00:57:50,354
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

885
00:57:50,527 --> 00:57:52,358
...and you're gonna close my file?

886
00:57:52,528 --> 00:57:56,157
- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I...
- I thought I was supposed to tell...

887
00:57:56,332 --> 00:57:58,926
- ... the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.

888
00:57:59,103 --> 00:58:03,233
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...

889
00:58:03,407 --> 00:58:04,396
...and what do you do?

890
00:58:04,575 --> 00:58:08,636
What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?

891
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:11,545
You're fucking ridiculous.

892
00:58:19,323 --> 00:58:21,120
Two pills?

893
00:58:21,992 --> 00:58:24,153
Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch...

894
00:58:24,328 --> 00:58:26,489
...and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?

895
00:58:26,664 --> 00:58:29,656
- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit?
- You can leave!

896
00:58:29,833 --> 00:58:32,233
What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.

897
00:58:32,403 --> 00:58:36,840
And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

898
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:39,835
<i>Fuck.</i>

899
00:58:48,552 --> 00:58:51,214
Why is the last patient of the day
always the hardest one?

900
00:58:51,389 --> 00:58:53,186
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

901
00:58:53,357 --> 00:58:55,257
- It's not supernatural.
- Listen.

902
00:58:55,427 --> 00:59:00,524
Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody
that you have to see or they put you in jail.

903
00:59:00,698 --> 00:59:03,565
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.

904
00:59:05,603 --> 00:59:07,161
What's this?

905
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:10,472
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 lorazepam.

906
00:59:10,642 --> 00:59:12,200
Yeah?

907
00:59:12,376 --> 00:59:14,003
Is it enough to commit suicide?

908
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:17,070
Maybe it is. All right? Okay?

909
00:59:17,248 --> 00:59:19,409
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

910
00:59:19,584 --> 00:59:23,315
Because according to my standards,
you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.

911
00:59:23,488 --> 00:59:27,117
You know, and too damn bad if you
don't like my initial clinical reaction.

912
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:28,554
Thank you.

913
00:59:29,794 --> 00:59:32,354
I'm transferring you to another counselor.

914
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,521
- Good.
- Okay.

915
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:38,260
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

916
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:47,977
Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

917
00:59:48,146 --> 00:59:49,511
Come on in.

918
00:59:50,615 --> 00:59:54,608
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

919
00:59:54,787 --> 00:59:56,379
Yes, those.

920
00:59:56,554 --> 01:00:00,285
I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.

921
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:02,983
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building...

922
01:00:03,162 --> 01:00:05,426
...that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.

923
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:09,191
I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.

924
01:00:09,367 --> 01:00:11,232
- You guys know anything about this?
- No.

925
01:00:11,404 --> 01:00:14,464
Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.

926
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,005
Our unit will not take action.

927
01:00:16,641 --> 01:00:20,509
I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

928
01:00:20,678 --> 01:00:22,873
...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?

929
01:00:23,048 --> 01:00:27,007
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

930
01:00:27,852 --> 01:00:30,787
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

931
01:00:30,956 --> 01:00:33,481
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

932
01:00:33,659 --> 01:00:36,423
All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

933
01:00:36,595 --> 01:00:38,927
Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.

934
01:00:39,098 --> 01:00:41,123
This lead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.

935
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:45,862
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.

936
01:00:50,976 --> 01:00:53,103
- Hi, Dad?
- Yes.

937
01:00:53,279 --> 01:00:55,440
<i>Yeah, something big came up at work.</i>

938
01:00:55,615 --> 01:00:58,106
<i>- I'm not gonna be home for supper.
- Too bad.</i>

939
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:00,851
Your mother worked all goddamn day.

940
01:01:01,153 --> 01:01:04,520
We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

941
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:06,851
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.

942
01:01:10,329 --> 01:01:13,162
So we'll just... I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.

943
01:01:14,066 --> 01:01:15,829
Your mother will be proud.

944
01:01:16,001 --> 01:01:17,866
All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

945
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:20,661
The readiness is all.

946
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,308
You know the players. Call the game.

947
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,240
Thank you.

948
01:01:29,482 --> 01:01:31,416
- You ready?
- Is your highness...

949
01:01:31,585 --> 01:01:34,748
...gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

950
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:37,651
What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?

951
01:01:37,824 --> 01:01:40,759
A confessional seal, these days...

952
01:01:40,926 --> 01:01:42,553
...I'm not so sure.

953
01:01:47,534 --> 01:01:50,264
He'll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.

954
01:01:50,704 --> 01:01:52,934
All cellphone signals
are under surveillance...

955
01:01:53,106 --> 01:01:55,870
...through the courtesy of
our federal friends over there.

956
01:01:58,378 --> 01:02:02,178
Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

957
01:02:05,385 --> 01:02:06,545
Keep an eye on this one.

958
01:02:41,755 --> 01:02:43,985
All right, here we go.

959
01:02:46,661 --> 01:02:48,959
There's Costello. Mr. French.

960
01:02:49,229 --> 01:02:50,958
There's Fitzy, Delahunt...

961
01:02:51,332 --> 01:02:53,163
...and the new guy, Billy Costigan.

962
01:02:59,739 --> 01:03:02,207
Time is 10:46.

963
01:03:04,277 --> 01:03:06,336
All right, turn off your cellphones.

964
01:03:06,514 --> 01:03:09,506
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

965
01:03:32,273 --> 01:03:35,299
- We have a blind spot.
- Why do we have a blind spot?

966
01:03:35,477 --> 01:03:37,377
We had two hours' notice. Two hours.

967
01:03:37,545 --> 01:03:40,275
- Fuck you think this is, NASA?
- It never crossed my mind.

968
01:03:40,448 --> 01:03:43,508
- Have you got a camera in the back?
- What back?

969
01:03:50,258 --> 01:03:52,886
- How you going, Robert?
- Good, Mr. Costello.

970
01:03:53,294 --> 01:03:56,923
I wanna tell you, at least two
of these gents have machine guns.

971
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:13,171
He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitless.

972
01:04:13,615 --> 01:04:16,482
Government man. Scared.

973
01:04:16,885 --> 01:04:20,582
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

974
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:24,157
...to come to a business transaction...

975
01:04:24,459 --> 01:04:26,222
...with automatic weapons.

976
01:04:33,068 --> 01:04:36,037
For his own good, tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids...

977
01:04:36,204 --> 01:04:38,832
...none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

978
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:42,306
Because here, in this country...

979
01:04:42,744 --> 01:04:45,269
...it don't add inches to your dick.

980
01:04:45,447 --> 01:04:47,642
You get a life sentence for it.

981
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:08,568
If we had some Homeland Security money
like some douche bags I could mention...

982
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:10,898
- Any calls?
- They turned off their cellphones.

983
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,602
Search randomly for calls
made from the area.

984
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:16,176
Eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area.

985
01:05:16,344 --> 01:05:17,811
Then narrow the area.

986
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,540
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

987
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:22,616
Why did they turn their phones off?

988
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:25,754
- Wait. There's still one phone up.
- Where?

989
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,799
The buyers are there.

990
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:46,840
You know, direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages.

991
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:48,499
Not to my guy.

992
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:51,775
This is unbelievable.
Who put the cameras in this place?

993
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:53,410
Oh, who the fuck are you?

994
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,078
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

995
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:03,556
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

996
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:07,992
...they'd better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars.

997
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:16,572
What we generally do, in this country...

998
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,869
...is one guy...

999
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:21,235
...brings the items...

1000
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,708
...and the other guy...

1001
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:25,310
...pays him.

1002
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:31,110
No "tickee"...

1003
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:33,951
...no laundry.

1004
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:44,492
Go ahead, Fitz.

1005
01:07:00,617 --> 01:07:03,609
Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?

1006
01:07:05,322 --> 01:07:07,381
Please tell me those cars aren't empty.

1007
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:12,620
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me
that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!

1008
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:20,136
They didn't figure we had a navy.

1009
01:07:25,976 --> 01:07:28,206
Did you put a camera in the back?

1010
01:07:29,913 --> 01:07:32,143
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

1011
01:07:34,485 --> 01:07:36,715
You stupid fucking hard-on!

1012
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,078
You fucked this whole thing up!

1013
01:07:39,257 --> 01:07:42,522
What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!

1014
01:07:42,694 --> 01:07:45,959
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!

1015
01:07:46,297 --> 01:07:48,492
Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

1016
01:07:48,665 --> 01:07:50,895
<i>I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on.</i>

1017
01:07:51,069 --> 01:07:54,061
Queenan had a funeral to go to.
This is my shift. Calm down.

1018
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,264
Why shouldn't I get
on a fucking plane, huh?

1019
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,068
Meet up? You actually want me dead?

1020
01:07:59,244 --> 01:08:02,077
Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, all right?

1021
01:08:02,247 --> 01:08:03,714
<i>- Where's Queenan?
- He's not here.</i>

1022
01:08:03,881 --> 01:08:06,941
They knew you had cameras in the building.
They knew everything.

1023
01:08:07,118 --> 01:08:10,281
There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.

1024
01:08:10,455 --> 01:08:14,482
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?

1025
01:08:14,659 --> 01:08:18,186
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have
a sealed wiretap warrant...

1026
01:08:18,363 --> 01:08:22,823
...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell
anyone in our division, but tell SIU.

1027
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:25,469
Flush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.

1028
01:08:25,637 --> 01:08:27,502
That's what we do first. Narrow it down.

1029
01:08:27,672 --> 01:08:30,732
<i>- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
- He's not here.</i>

1030
01:08:30,909 --> 01:08:34,003
You wanna meet up
or you got something real, call me back.

1031
01:08:40,018 --> 01:08:43,181
...changing your life radically.

1032
01:08:43,355 --> 01:08:45,755
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

1033
01:08:45,924 --> 01:08:47,949
- Right?
- Yeah.

1034
01:08:50,863 --> 01:08:53,229
How long you been with this guy?

1035
01:08:54,065 --> 01:08:56,693
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

1036
01:08:59,405 --> 01:09:02,602
- Four months. Almost four months.
- Four months.

1037
01:09:02,775 --> 01:09:04,299
Do you love him?

1038
01:09:06,478 --> 01:09:08,946
It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.

1039
01:09:09,113 --> 01:09:10,478
It's very serious.

1040
01:09:10,649 --> 01:09:14,346
Is he a headcase like me?
I'm just curious.

1041
01:09:14,954 --> 01:09:16,979
No more than I am.

1042
01:09:17,623 --> 01:09:19,614
I know that it's a serious relationship.

1043
01:09:20,258 --> 01:09:22,488
I know there are ups and downs. Right?

1044
01:09:22,661 --> 01:09:24,993
People have doubts and problems.

1045
01:09:25,464 --> 01:09:29,127
Well, not problems, but doubts.

1046
01:09:31,869 --> 01:09:35,635
What would you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?

1047
01:09:40,646 --> 01:09:44,013
I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.

1048
01:09:44,183 --> 01:09:47,710
You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?

1049
01:09:47,886 --> 01:09:49,979
Right? We talked about that.

1050
01:09:55,527 --> 01:09:57,495
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1051
01:09:58,063 --> 01:10:00,088
Want a French doughnut?

1052
01:10:00,599 --> 01:10:02,066
Yeah.

1053
01:10:03,502 --> 01:10:05,094
- Hey, can I lookit?
- Yeah.

1054
01:10:05,504 --> 01:10:06,732
Sure.

1055
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:12,003
- All right, we're not having this out.
- What?

1056
01:10:12,177 --> 01:10:14,338
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

1057
01:10:14,814 --> 01:10:16,281
Look, I respect who you are...

1058
01:10:16,448 --> 01:10:18,609
...just, you know, not in the living room.

1059
01:10:18,785 --> 01:10:20,377
We might have company.

1060
01:10:20,552 --> 01:10:22,543
- Company?
- Yeah, company.

1061
01:10:23,289 --> 01:10:26,690
- Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
- Why not? You do.

1062
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:30,557
No, what you do. The degrees and all,
everything you got. You're hot shit.

1063
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:31,919
Yeah?

1064
01:10:32,097 --> 01:10:35,032
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counselor?

1065
01:10:35,201 --> 01:10:38,728
Because I believe in public service.

1066
01:10:40,506 --> 01:10:43,873
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?

1067
01:10:44,644 --> 01:10:47,112
- No, don't start with me. Don't...
- Hey.

1068
01:10:47,846 --> 01:10:50,406
Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!

1069
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:52,278
- The phone.
- Forget the phone.

1070
01:10:52,452 --> 01:10:53,919
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

1071
01:10:54,187 --> 01:10:56,314
This is your first phone call
in the new house.

1072
01:10:56,489 --> 01:10:58,684
You live here now. You're a resident.

1073
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,389
Mayor Sullivan's office.

1074
01:11:02,562 --> 01:11:05,360
<i>Put Colin on the phone right now.</i>

1075
01:11:05,832 --> 01:11:07,129
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1076
01:11:07,301 --> 01:11:08,825
What?

1077
01:11:09,302 --> 01:11:11,429
I think it's a guy with...

1078
01:11:11,604 --> 01:11:15,597
- It's like a cancer guy.
- Hello.

1079
01:11:15,775 --> 01:11:18,938
What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?

1080
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:22,145
Something for work.

1081
01:11:22,315 --> 01:11:26,183
Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get...

1082
01:11:26,387 --> 01:11:28,651
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

1083
01:11:28,822 --> 01:11:31,450
Remember I told you that we were...
She was gonna move in?

1084
01:11:31,624 --> 01:11:33,319
<i>- Yeah.
- She moved in.</i>

1085
01:11:33,493 --> 01:11:37,224
- You better get organized, quick.
- Last time I checked, I tipped you off...

1086
01:11:37,397 --> 01:11:39,228
...and you're not in jail.

1087
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:42,800
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

1088
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:46,701
Do you like Little Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?

1089
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:50,775
Yes. Yes, I do.

1090
01:11:50,945 --> 01:11:52,572
So earn it.

1091
01:11:53,447 --> 01:11:55,506
I'm getting the feeling...

1092
01:11:55,682 --> 01:11:57,582
...we got a cop in my crew.

1093
01:11:57,885 --> 01:12:00,285
Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeling too.

1094
01:12:00,454 --> 01:12:03,252
He's one of yours. Inside.

1095
01:12:03,423 --> 01:12:04,515
<i>Have you seen anything?</i>

1096
01:12:04,692 --> 01:12:08,287
I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1097
01:12:08,462 --> 01:12:09,656
<i>- Doing my best.
- Your best?</i>

1098
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:12,697
What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?

1099
01:12:12,867 --> 01:12:14,425
Look, Frank, if you don't relax...

1100
01:12:14,602 --> 01:12:18,470
If you don't relax, I can't relax. All right?
Now, what I need you to do...

1101
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:22,097
<i>...get me information on the people
with you last night. Your crew.</i>

1102
01:12:22,276 --> 01:12:24,210
Get me social-security numbers, get me...

1103
01:12:24,378 --> 01:12:28,542
Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?

1104
01:12:28,716 --> 01:12:31,981
All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
All right. I'm sorry.

1105
01:12:32,153 --> 01:12:35,350
If you could, please.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...

1106
01:12:35,523 --> 01:12:40,051
...just all the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.

1107
01:12:40,227 --> 01:12:42,024
<i>If you can get me that information...</i>

1108
01:12:42,197 --> 01:12:44,631
...I can... We're gonna handle it.
I can handle it.

1109
01:12:44,798 --> 01:12:46,993
Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.

1110
01:12:47,169 --> 01:12:48,898
<i>I'll get you the records and whatnot.</i>

1111
01:12:49,069 --> 01:12:52,232
<i>But listen to me, son.
Don't disappoint me on this...</i>

1112
01:12:52,406 --> 01:12:55,705
...or some other guy will be putting
their fat cock...

1113
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:58,367
...up Little Miss Freud's ass.

1114
01:13:05,187 --> 01:13:07,553
How are you, Francis?

1115
01:13:12,727 --> 01:13:16,219
- My mother called me Francis.
- I know she did.

1116
01:13:16,398 --> 01:13:19,196
And your father called you the tumor.

1117
01:13:19,366 --> 01:13:22,028
And what did your father
call you, Charlie?

1118
01:13:22,204 --> 01:13:26,197
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasn't around.

1119
01:13:26,374 --> 01:13:28,501
You have a boss
that has a laryngectomy?

1120
01:13:28,677 --> 01:13:32,579
No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.

1121
01:13:32,747 --> 01:13:34,738
You're lying to me.

1122
01:13:36,518 --> 01:13:37,883
Not exactly.

1123
01:13:38,053 --> 01:13:41,511
What did you do with
the real microprocessors, Frank?

1124
01:13:41,957 --> 01:13:44,653
Microprocessors.

1125
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,388
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:13:46,561 --> 01:13:49,724
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

1127
01:13:49,898 --> 01:13:53,231
...at the border carrying some light sockets
or something.

1128
01:13:54,937 --> 01:13:57,770
I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.

1129
01:13:58,441 --> 01:14:01,103
Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?

1130
01:14:01,276 --> 01:14:05,235
There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.

1131
01:14:05,614 --> 01:14:10,381
And I cannot allow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation...

1132
01:14:10,553 --> 01:14:12,578
...or your life.

1133
01:14:13,556 --> 01:14:16,548
No, really, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.

1134
01:14:17,193 --> 01:14:18,922
Okay, then just say that.

1135
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:22,375
All right, I will.

1136
01:14:23,012 --> 01:14:25,173
Oh, that's the movers.

1137
01:14:25,348 --> 01:14:27,111
Yeah, you still wanna stay?

1138
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:30,244
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1139
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:34,049
Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.

1140
01:14:34,491 --> 01:14:36,459
I'm gonna get you.

1141
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:40,493
If you could've, you would've.

1142
01:14:40,764 --> 01:14:44,325
But I guess you like to go
at your own pace.

1143
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:48,870
Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.

1144
01:14:56,913 --> 01:14:57,902
<i>Frankie.</i>

1145
01:14:58,848 --> 01:15:00,315
<i>Frankie!</i>

1146
01:15:01,184 --> 01:15:03,277
<i>Your mother forgives me.</i>

1147
01:15:08,057 --> 01:15:09,922
You take off an armored car at the mall.

1148
01:15:10,093 --> 01:15:12,118
What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?

1149
01:15:12,295 --> 01:15:15,128
- Fucking now I do!
- What the fuck do you do?

1150
01:15:15,298 --> 01:15:19,701
I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.

1151
01:15:19,869 --> 01:15:22,360
FBI? What the fuck
you talking about, FBI?

1152
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:27,334
My God, is that French out there?

1153
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:29,671
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?

1154
01:15:29,847 --> 01:15:31,781
Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.

1155
01:15:32,448 --> 01:15:34,939
Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor...

1156
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:38,885
...very limited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, all right?

1157
01:15:39,156 --> 01:15:41,317
- Just tell me what you fucking said.
- Forget it.

1158
01:15:41,492 --> 01:15:45,394
I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.

1159
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:47,219
Fuck!

1160
01:15:47,397 --> 01:15:50,696
Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?

1161
01:15:50,868 --> 01:15:54,827
Why do you think he never gets busted?
Costello's a protected FBI informant.

1162
01:15:55,005 --> 01:15:57,496
He'll trade you out.

1163
01:15:57,875 --> 01:16:00,571
I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.

1164
01:16:00,744 --> 01:16:03,838
I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!

1165
01:16:04,014 --> 01:16:07,006
It fucking hurts!

1166
01:16:14,525 --> 01:16:16,755
Hey. It's me.

1167
01:16:16,927 --> 01:16:19,259
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

1168
01:16:21,465 --> 01:16:24,229
Costello's giving people up to the FBI.

1169
01:16:24,401 --> 01:16:28,701
- The FBI?
- He is giving information to the FBI.

1170
01:16:28,873 --> 01:16:31,239
He's a protected fucking informant.

1171
01:16:31,408 --> 01:16:35,640
I mean, aren't they always trying to make it
a federal case and it never gets made?

1172
01:16:36,814 --> 01:16:39,442
Go around the back.
I'll open the door. Go on.

1173
01:16:43,154 --> 01:16:46,521
- Here's some ice water.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

1174
01:16:51,595 --> 01:16:53,290
That's my son, Patrick.

1175
01:16:53,598 --> 01:16:56,726
- Goes to Notre Dame.
- Oh, yeah?

1176
01:16:56,902 --> 01:17:00,269
My wife's asleep but she left some
supper out. You want something to eat?

1177
01:17:00,437 --> 01:17:01,927
No. No, thanks.

1178
01:17:02,107 --> 01:17:05,702
Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.

1179
01:17:05,877 --> 01:17:07,504
Come on.

1180
01:17:43,049 --> 01:17:44,277
You want some coke?

1181
01:17:49,821 --> 01:17:51,721
There it is.

1182
01:17:52,357 --> 01:17:54,848
Don't move till you're numb.

1183
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:11,809
Come on. Get inside.

1184
01:18:14,146 --> 01:18:15,977
Boss wants your real name...

1185
01:18:16,682 --> 01:18:19,674
...your social and license number,
your bank account numbers.

1186
01:18:19,851 --> 01:18:21,944
I don't have a bank account.

1187
01:18:22,121 --> 01:18:25,318
- I'm a cash business myself.
- What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

1188
01:18:25,491 --> 01:18:29,427
Just fill the fucking paper in. Your real name
and all your account numbers.

1189
01:18:29,595 --> 01:18:31,426
Then we wait here.

1190
01:18:32,264 --> 01:18:34,994
- You're shitting me.
- No, I ain't.

1191
01:18:46,379 --> 01:18:48,506
Put the forms in there.

1192
01:18:52,018 --> 01:18:54,384
I don't know if this
is how you spell "citizens."

1193
01:18:54,554 --> 01:18:57,216
But fuck it, you know?

1194
01:18:57,723 --> 01:19:00,191
No, no, no. Come here.

1195
01:19:05,164 --> 01:19:07,155
What, are you fucking retarded
or something?

1196
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:09,494
That ain't fucking right.

1197
01:19:09,668 --> 01:19:10,930
Are you kidding me?

1198
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,400
Look at this. Look.

1199
01:19:13,172 --> 01:19:15,163
"Citizens." Look.

1200
01:19:15,508 --> 01:19:16,839
Billy, he said to stay here.

1201
01:19:17,209 --> 01:19:19,734
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.

1202
01:19:19,912 --> 01:19:21,277
Where the fuck are you going?

1203
01:19:21,448 --> 01:19:25,612
I'm not staying, all right?
You can tell him I said that.

1204
01:19:44,938 --> 01:19:46,963
- Hey.
- Hi.

1205
01:19:49,009 --> 01:19:51,068
- It's pouring out there.
- Yeah.

1206
01:19:57,984 --> 01:19:59,849
Look...

1207
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:01,783
- ... if this is inappropriate, I...
- No.

1208
01:20:01,955 --> 01:20:04,583
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

1209
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:09,395
So you moving out or you moving in?

1210
01:20:10,163 --> 01:20:12,324
I've still got
three weeks left on the lease.

1211
01:20:21,508 --> 01:20:23,169
That's me.

1212
01:20:26,247 --> 01:20:27,737
Yeah, I know.

1213
01:20:33,821 --> 01:20:37,518
- Hedging your bets?
- No. No.

1214
01:20:37,892 --> 01:20:39,291
You have to choose.

1215
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:42,121
- You have to make a...
- A decision.

1216
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:45,697
A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.

1217
01:20:45,867 --> 01:20:48,131
- You have to...
- Move in with your boyfriend?

1218
01:20:48,301 --> 01:20:50,895
Yes. Otherwise it's...

1219
01:20:51,838 --> 01:20:54,739
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

1220
01:21:05,553 --> 01:21:10,786
I have to say your vulnerability
is really freaking me out right now.

1221
01:21:15,997 --> 01:21:17,658
Is it real?

1222
01:21:21,569 --> 01:21:23,298
I think so.

1223
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:31,075
You don't have any cats.

1224
01:21:31,245 --> 01:21:32,803
No.

1225
01:21:33,781 --> 01:21:35,544
I like that.

1226
01:22:47,856 --> 01:22:49,050
I don't get it.

1227
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,588
We are all convinced
that Costello has at least...

1228
01:22:54,764 --> 01:22:57,927
...one mole inside
the Special Investigations Unit.

1229
01:22:58,101 --> 01:23:02,333
You will investigate everybody
and anybody.

1230
01:23:02,505 --> 01:23:06,669
Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.

1231
01:23:06,843 --> 01:23:10,108
We looked at all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record.

1232
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:13,613
Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.

1233
01:23:13,783 --> 01:23:15,250
I have an immaculate record.

1234
01:23:16,518 --> 01:23:18,383
How is your wedding coming along?

1235
01:23:18,554 --> 01:23:20,988
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

1236
01:23:21,524 --> 01:23:23,924
- That's outstanding.
- Yeah.

1237
01:23:24,092 --> 01:23:26,219
Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.

1238
01:23:26,396 --> 01:23:29,297
Lets people know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stable.

1239
01:23:29,465 --> 01:23:32,127
People see the ring, think at least
someone can stand him.

1240
01:23:32,302 --> 01:23:36,363
Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.

1241
01:23:37,173 --> 01:23:39,607
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

1242
01:23:40,043 --> 01:23:42,773
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you.

1243
01:24:30,861 --> 01:24:34,524
Be dirty, be dirty.

1244
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,895
Yeah...

1245
01:24:44,108 --> 01:24:46,838
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

1246
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:50,736
- See anything you like, Col?
- I almost fucking shot you.

1247
01:24:50,913 --> 01:24:53,814
- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you?
- Sit down.

1248
01:24:53,984 --> 01:24:58,045
I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.

1249
01:24:58,422 --> 01:25:00,117
You're not cracking up, are you?

1250
01:25:01,058 --> 01:25:03,618
- I don't crack up.
- Pick a place like this...

1251
01:25:03,794 --> 01:25:05,694
...where any cop could see you. Jesus.

1252
01:25:05,863 --> 01:25:09,026
If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?

1253
01:25:09,633 --> 01:25:11,294
I own the place.

1254
01:25:13,604 --> 01:25:16,198
Why am I not fucking surprised?

1255
01:25:17,541 --> 01:25:21,272
- All right, lookit, I gotta tell you...
- You're getting reassigned. I know.

1256
01:25:21,979 --> 01:25:23,446
How the fuck do you know that?

1257
01:25:23,614 --> 01:25:25,912
- Where'd they put you?
- Hey, Frank.

1258
01:25:26,084 --> 01:25:29,645
I gotta find myself.

1259
01:25:29,821 --> 01:25:31,413
You're telling me, sonny boy.

1260
01:25:32,022 --> 01:25:34,422
I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.

1261
01:25:35,159 --> 01:25:38,788
With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself...

1262
01:25:38,962 --> 01:25:41,021
...I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.

1263
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:45,636
I know, but, Frank, lookit.
For me, you gotta lay low.

1264
01:25:45,804 --> 01:25:47,635
- Right now.
- Collie...

1265
01:25:47,805 --> 01:25:50,205
...laying low is not what I do.

1266
01:25:50,375 --> 01:25:53,037
All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.

1267
01:25:53,211 --> 01:25:55,441
What good am I to you
if you don't listen to me?

1268
01:25:55,612 --> 01:25:57,204
What good am I if you don't listen?

1269
01:26:02,353 --> 01:26:05,151
Queenan is compartmentalizing.
He's splitting everything up.

1270
01:26:05,323 --> 01:26:06,984
He's fucking smart. You know this.

1271
01:26:07,157 --> 01:26:10,752
I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.

1272
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:15,459
Okay.

1273
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:22,171
But Colin,
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1274
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:26,367
...that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1275
01:26:26,544 --> 01:26:30,776
...most likely,
it won't be me who suffers for it.

1276
01:26:31,716 --> 01:26:34,207
Now, why would you have to
remind me of that?

1277
01:26:34,386 --> 01:26:39,551
Would I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking already know that?

1278
01:26:39,724 --> 01:26:42,158
Frank, you gotta trust me.

1279
01:26:42,695 --> 01:26:45,061
All right? Just trust me, Frank.

1280
01:26:46,298 --> 01:26:50,860
Hey, it fucking involves lying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1281
01:26:51,035 --> 01:26:52,696
Right?

1282
01:26:52,871 --> 01:26:55,499
Maybe because
it's always been so easy...

1283
01:26:55,673 --> 01:27:00,303
...for me to get cunt that I never understood
jerking off in a theater.

1284
01:27:06,818 --> 01:27:08,376
Christ.

1285
01:27:10,523 --> 01:27:13,048
Who knows what's easy?

1286
01:27:13,826 --> 01:27:18,490
Colin, I know you'll take care
of business.

1287
01:28:03,242 --> 01:28:04,709
Shit!

1288
01:28:43,617 --> 01:28:45,050
Fuck.

1289
01:30:03,196 --> 01:30:04,686
Hey, how you doing?

1290
01:30:04,865 --> 01:30:07,026
Hi, Darlene, hi.

1291
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:13,070
- That's it for me.
- Yeah, see you.

1292
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,935
Have a good one.

1293
01:30:38,066 --> 01:30:40,227
I smell a rat.

1294
01:30:46,874 --> 01:30:48,102
Jesus Christ.

1295
01:30:49,177 --> 01:30:50,769
You got a girlfriend?

1296
01:30:52,714 --> 01:30:54,375
No.

1297
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:56,608
No, no. Why, what does that matter?

1298
01:30:58,353 --> 01:30:59,718
It depends.

1299
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:05,552
I'm sure by now you know...

1300
01:31:06,161 --> 01:31:09,289
...I got an informer in my outfit.

1301
01:31:10,265 --> 01:31:11,493
Cop.

1302
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:16,933
Staties, Boston Police Department,
I'm not sure.

1303
01:31:17,105 --> 01:31:19,266
Jesus Christ.

1304
01:31:20,876 --> 01:31:23,504
Are you sure it's not the FBI?

1305
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:27,847
It ain't the FBI.

1306
01:31:28,884 --> 01:31:30,818
Ex-wife.

1307
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:34,179
Old girlfriend.

1308
01:31:35,557 --> 01:31:37,491
Or stupid.

1309
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:42,027
That is what brings you down
in this business.

1310
01:31:42,198 --> 01:31:43,893
Stupid, huh?

1311
01:31:44,566 --> 01:31:46,466
Well, I guess that leaves me out.

1312
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:56,075
You know, past days, situation like this,
I kill everybody.

1313
01:31:56,812 --> 01:31:59,246
Everybody who works for me.

1314
01:31:59,714 --> 01:32:02,012
Right. You know, Frank...

1315
01:32:02,185 --> 01:32:04,278
...I look around at your other guys...

1316
01:32:05,087 --> 01:32:08,022
I mean, they're all murderers, right?
Right?

1317
01:32:08,691 --> 01:32:11,854
And I think, "Could I do murder?"

1318
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:17,093
And all I can answer myself is:

1319
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,625
"What's the difference?"

1320
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:23,702
Give them up to the Almighty.

1321
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:26,936
You see, that's my point, you know?

1322
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:32,204
You accuse me once, I put up with it.

1323
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:33,712
You accuse me twice...

1324
01:32:35,351 --> 01:32:37,251
...I quit.

1325
01:32:37,854 --> 01:32:42,257
You pressure me to fear for my life and
I will put a fucking bullet in your head...

1326
01:32:42,425 --> 01:32:45,360
...as if you were anybody else. Okay?

1327
01:32:56,505 --> 01:33:00,168
You got something
you wanna ask me?

1328
01:33:02,312 --> 01:33:06,339
Look, you're 70 years old, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?

1329
01:33:07,216 --> 01:33:09,514
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

1330
01:33:09,686 --> 01:33:12,018
- One of your guys is gonna pop you.
- Yeah, yeah.

1331
01:33:12,188 --> 01:33:14,486
As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?

1332
01:33:14,657 --> 01:33:18,252
You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they will catch you.

1333
01:33:18,428 --> 01:33:20,555
I haven't needed the money...

1334
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:24,860
...since I took Archie's milk money
in the third grade.

1335
01:33:25,035 --> 01:33:28,300
Tell you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.

1336
01:33:29,773 --> 01:33:31,604
But I like it.

1337
01:33:32,776 --> 01:33:35,540
Point I'm making here is, Bill...

1338
01:33:35,711 --> 01:33:38,544
...I got this rat...

1339
01:33:38,714 --> 01:33:43,014
...this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat...

1340
01:33:43,185 --> 01:33:45,585
...and it brings up questions.

1341
01:33:45,756 --> 01:33:49,749
You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.

1342
01:33:50,993 --> 01:33:52,824
Girlfriend...

1343
01:33:54,664 --> 01:33:59,533
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

1344
01:34:00,304 --> 01:34:02,966
Social-security numbers.

1345
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:06,075
- Yeah.
- Everybody's fucking numbers.

1346
01:34:06,243 --> 01:34:09,041
Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?

1347
01:34:09,212 --> 01:34:11,612
Because I'll give you
the fucking answer, all right?

1348
01:34:11,782 --> 01:34:13,716
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

1349
01:34:13,884 --> 01:34:17,183
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

1350
01:34:17,354 --> 01:34:18,753
I'm not the fucking rat.

1351
01:34:19,856 --> 01:34:22,188
Start with you agree there is a rat.

1352
01:34:23,093 --> 01:34:24,617
You said there is one, all right?

1353
01:34:24,795 --> 01:34:28,322
I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.

1354
01:34:28,498 --> 01:34:30,591
Sure. Sure, Will.

1355
01:34:30,767 --> 01:34:35,261
You, William. What would you do?

1356
01:34:40,277 --> 01:34:41,801
Frank, how many of these guys...

1357
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:44,380
...have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled?

1358
01:34:44,549 --> 01:34:47,518
Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.

1359
01:34:47,684 --> 01:34:50,653
It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.

1360
01:34:50,821 --> 01:34:54,348
The question is,
and this is the only question...

1361
01:34:55,192 --> 01:34:59,686
...who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?

1362
01:35:00,631 --> 01:35:03,794
The only one
who could do what I do is me.

1363
01:35:05,069 --> 01:35:08,505
Lot of people had to die
for me to be me.

1364
01:35:11,008 --> 01:35:13,033
You wanna be me?

1365
01:35:16,748 --> 01:35:19,410
I probably could be you. Yeah.

1366
01:35:19,584 --> 01:35:21,074
Yeah, I know that much.

1367
01:35:22,387 --> 01:35:25,447
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

1368
01:35:25,623 --> 01:35:27,887
I don't wanna be you.

1369
01:35:28,893 --> 01:35:33,830
"Heavy lies the crown" sort of thing.

1370
01:35:34,333 --> 01:35:35,766
Yeah.

1371
01:35:36,601 --> 01:35:39,069
- Francis.
- I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm...

1372
01:35:39,237 --> 01:35:43,333
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.
- All right. Good night.

1373
01:35:45,844 --> 01:35:48,711
You know what I like about restaurants?

1374
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,745
The fucking food? I don't know. What?

1375
01:35:51,249 --> 01:35:55,151
You learn a lot watching things eat.

1376
01:35:57,389 --> 01:35:59,721
There's a boat coming up Gloucester.

1377
01:36:00,692 --> 01:36:03,525
French will give you all the details.
Don't forget.

1378
01:36:03,694 --> 01:36:06,857
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

1379
01:36:11,035 --> 01:36:16,268
In the future, I tell you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?

1380
01:36:17,109 --> 01:36:19,373
I got it. Okay?

1381
01:36:21,747 --> 01:36:23,305
Excuse me...

1382
01:36:23,482 --> 01:36:26,144
- ... French, I forgot my...
- Okay, Francis.

1383
01:36:26,318 --> 01:36:27,307
...cigarette.

1384
01:36:30,289 --> 01:36:32,621
Eat something.

1385
01:36:41,266 --> 01:36:42,255
Problem?

1386
01:36:42,434 --> 01:36:45,961
Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks
like you, okay? I don't like them.

1387
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:48,471
The day you wouldn't take a promotion,
let me know.

1388
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,767
If you'd taken care of this
I wouldn't be here.

1389
01:36:50,943 --> 01:36:54,470
- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
- I need the identity of your undercovers.

1390
01:36:54,646 --> 01:36:58,207
Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately,
there's no promotion involved for you.

1391
01:36:58,384 --> 01:36:59,373
Fucking prick.

1392
01:36:59,785 --> 01:37:02,777
- Hi, captain.
- Look who's here. The prom queen.

1393
01:37:02,955 --> 01:37:05,287
- They are not happy with me.
- What do you expect?

1394
01:37:05,625 --> 01:37:08,958
Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find Costello's rat.

1395
01:37:09,729 --> 01:37:12,323
They want to find the leak
as much as you do.

1396
01:37:12,799 --> 01:37:16,860
Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who Costello's rat is.

1397
01:37:18,604 --> 01:37:21,505
- But he lost him in the streets.
- Really?

1398
01:37:23,842 --> 01:37:27,107
- Well, did he get a look at the guy?
- No.

1399
01:37:27,279 --> 01:37:30,043
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.

1400
01:37:30,216 --> 01:37:31,444
No.

1401
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,821
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.

1402
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:41,287
Costello can't do much business without
coordinating with his source...

1403
01:37:41,461 --> 01:37:43,326
...who is here in SIU.

1404
01:37:45,098 --> 01:37:47,464
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1405
01:37:55,108 --> 01:37:57,736
<i>You're gonna be looking at my people...</i>

1406
01:37:57,944 --> 01:38:02,176
<i>...going through their bank statements,
their phone calls and medical records.</i>

1407
01:38:02,349 --> 01:38:07,150
<i>Don't be surprised if they don't buy you
a beer or invite you into their homes.</i>

1408
01:38:08,588 --> 01:38:10,579
<i>Let me get you a coffee.</i>

1409
01:38:13,527 --> 01:38:16,758
<i>If I wasn't
with the Massachusetts State Police...</i>

1410
01:38:17,398 --> 01:38:20,333
...if I did it full-time, law school...

1411
01:38:20,934 --> 01:38:23,095
...I'd be through it in a year.

1412
01:38:24,404 --> 01:38:26,304
If I wasn't a trooper.

1413
01:38:30,610 --> 01:38:33,443
But another city. I was thinking that.

1414
01:38:34,681 --> 01:38:36,410
Another city.

1415
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:38,982
Another city, huh?

1416
01:38:40,487 --> 01:38:43,615
Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.

1417
01:38:44,158 --> 01:38:47,423
<i>I want you to know,
you don't got to stay.</i>

1418
01:38:49,763 --> 01:38:51,560
If we're not gonna make it...

1419
01:38:51,732 --> 01:38:56,192
...it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capable.

1420
01:38:57,504 --> 01:39:01,838
I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something
being wrong for the rest of my life.

1421
01:39:10,618 --> 01:39:14,452
<i>It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.</i>

1422
01:39:32,706 --> 01:39:35,470
- Of course I know how to spot a cop.
- How's that?

1423
01:39:35,643 --> 01:39:38,669
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.

1424
01:39:38,846 --> 01:39:42,111
Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.

1425
01:39:42,284 --> 01:39:43,273
Yeah.

1426
01:39:43,450 --> 01:39:47,147
Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.

1427
01:39:47,788 --> 01:39:50,621
- Okay.
- You get it now, do you?

1428
01:39:56,564 --> 01:39:58,532
- What about this guy?
- Cop.

1429
01:40:01,102 --> 01:40:03,832
Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?

1430
01:40:05,607 --> 01:40:07,939
She ignored us so she must be a cop.

1431
01:40:08,109 --> 01:40:10,407
She's probably
the fucking police commissioner.

1432
01:40:21,923 --> 01:40:25,950
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

1433
01:40:27,696 --> 01:40:32,326
- I thought I was on for this.
- I changed my mind. Take the night off.

1434
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:36,698
Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.

1435
01:40:37,472 --> 01:40:40,032
- Jimmy, bring a mop.
- Out the back.

1436
01:40:41,042 --> 01:40:43,135
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

1437
01:40:43,311 --> 01:40:45,609
- ... and there's guys that don't.
- And a pail.

1438
01:40:48,016 --> 01:40:49,643
You're a cop.

1439
01:40:50,119 --> 01:40:51,450
What?

1440
01:40:51,619 --> 01:40:53,746
You ignored us, you're a cop.

1441
01:40:54,789 --> 01:40:58,520
We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-looking women are cops.

1442
01:40:59,961 --> 01:41:03,089
Well, I'm going home, all right?
He's playing with his new guys.

1443
01:41:03,264 --> 01:41:05,198
- See you later, all right?
- See you later.

1444
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:15,101
He's moving something with all new guys.
A whole new crew.

1445
01:41:15,276 --> 01:41:18,473
No, no, I can't tell you what or where.
It's probably disinformation.

1446
01:41:18,646 --> 01:41:21,945
Just keep following him, all right?
Listen, I need to see you today.

1447
01:41:22,118 --> 01:41:23,551
<i>- Tomorrow.
- No, no, no. Today.</i>

1448
01:41:23,719 --> 01:41:26,085
<i>- You heard nothing about drugs?
- No.</i>

1449
01:41:26,254 --> 01:41:29,712
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?

1450
01:41:29,892 --> 01:41:33,658
Not a thing. And I would have.
That information would have come to me.

1451
01:41:35,531 --> 01:41:37,158
It ain't Bill.

1452
01:41:37,333 --> 01:41:39,096
No way, he says.

1453
01:41:51,614 --> 01:41:53,980
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1454
01:41:54,151 --> 01:41:55,675
Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.

1455
01:41:55,851 --> 01:42:00,254
I want constant surveillance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.

1456
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:02,985
Good. Thank you.

1457
01:42:05,829 --> 01:42:09,765
Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we following Captain Queenan?

1458
01:42:09,933 --> 01:42:11,833
To find out about the good Catholic life?

1459
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:15,164
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely...

1460
01:42:15,337 --> 01:42:19,103
...however fucking painful it might be
to your delicate fucking sensibilities.

1461
01:42:19,275 --> 01:42:21,266
Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?

1462
01:42:21,445 --> 01:42:24,972
<i>- I just don't like it. Don't feel right.
- I have reason to believe...</i>

1463
01:42:25,148 --> 01:42:27,878
...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.

1464
01:42:28,051 --> 01:42:30,349
So just follow him and don't get made.

1465
01:42:33,690 --> 01:42:36,557
Sarge, we got the target coming out.

1466
01:43:13,029 --> 01:43:14,257
Hey. Where are you?

1467
01:43:14,431 --> 01:43:16,399
<i>Look down the car.</i>

1468
01:43:17,802 --> 01:43:20,270
<i>- You got me?
- Yeah, I gotcha.</i>

1469
01:43:20,437 --> 01:43:22,302
Is there a reason you would have a tail?

1470
01:43:22,806 --> 01:43:24,205
No.

1471
01:43:25,843 --> 01:43:28,676
- Because I think...
- Billy, I don't have a tail.

1472
01:43:30,014 --> 01:43:33,643
Get off at the next stop, all right?
South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.

1473
01:43:33,818 --> 01:43:36,082
South Station. Wait 10 minutes.

1474
01:44:12,023 --> 01:44:15,220
He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

1475
01:44:15,393 --> 01:44:17,918
You got that? 344 Wash.

1476
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:23,727
Yeah, he went up to the top floor.

1477
01:44:28,306 --> 01:44:30,968
Building's empty. No tenants here.

1478
01:44:32,476 --> 01:44:35,775
He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He...

1479
01:44:36,614 --> 01:44:38,104
He's getting spooky, captain.

1480
01:44:38,282 --> 01:44:39,408
- What?
- I just saw him.

1481
01:44:39,584 --> 01:44:42,109
He had blood on his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.

1482
01:44:48,694 --> 01:44:51,128
I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.

1483
01:44:51,762 --> 01:44:54,731
He's not including his regular guys.
But I'll tell you something.

1484
01:44:54,899 --> 01:44:58,426
Sooner or later he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.

1485
01:44:58,603 --> 01:45:00,935
- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!
- All right!

1486
01:45:07,779 --> 01:45:10,748
I think we got him. I think Queenan's
meeting with him right now.

1487
01:45:10,915 --> 01:45:12,610
All right, all right. Listen to me.

1488
01:45:12,784 --> 01:45:15,582
I'm really sorry for your trouble.
I swear to God I am.

1489
01:45:15,754 --> 01:45:19,019
I'll get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'll get you out.

1490
01:45:20,092 --> 01:45:21,150
Yeah?

1491
01:45:21,326 --> 01:45:24,022
Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.

1492
01:45:24,196 --> 01:45:26,528
- What about the FBI?
- They're compromised.

1493
01:45:26,698 --> 01:45:28,131
- They're what?
- They're fucked.

1494
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:33,330
<i>- Yeah.
- Where are you?</i>

1495
01:45:33,505 --> 01:45:35,803
We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.

1496
01:45:36,274 --> 01:45:38,265
<i>Listen, we're gonna take him out.
Lookit:</i>

1497
01:45:38,443 --> 01:45:41,037
The address is 314 Washington Street.
You got it?

1498
01:45:41,213 --> 01:45:42,646
All right, we'll see you there.

1499
01:45:43,181 --> 01:45:44,409
- What?
- You were followed.

1500
01:45:44,583 --> 01:45:46,175
- By who?
- By Costello's people.

1501
01:45:46,351 --> 01:45:47,784
- Impossible.
- One of the cops...

1502
01:45:47,953 --> 01:45:50,683
...he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.

1503
01:45:51,657 --> 01:45:53,181
Come on!

1504
01:45:59,831 --> 01:46:02,299
What the fuck is going on?

1505
01:46:03,402 --> 01:46:06,235
Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's
meeting with all of them.

1506
01:46:07,139 --> 01:46:09,573
Yeah, he must be our guy.

1507
01:46:09,742 --> 01:46:13,041
<i>Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.
Those guys aren't fucking around.</i>

1508
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:20,817
Ah, Christ, it's too late.
Let's go back up.

1509
01:46:24,891 --> 01:46:26,688
- Shit!
- You got to get out of here!

1510
01:46:26,858 --> 01:46:28,689
- Take the fire escape.
- What about you?

1511
01:46:28,861 --> 01:46:31,887
I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!

1512
01:46:49,515 --> 01:46:52,075
- One of you mugs got a light?
- Where's your boy?

1513
01:46:52,251 --> 01:46:55,277
- He's studying law at Notre Dame.
- Where's your fucking boy?

1514
01:46:55,455 --> 01:46:57,548
- Hey! Hey!
- Goddamn motherfucker!

1515
01:46:57,724 --> 01:46:59,749
- Fucking kill you!
- Where's your fucking boy?

1516
01:47:16,075 --> 01:47:19,067
What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?

1517
01:47:23,416 --> 01:47:25,441
Sarge, something
just came off the building.

1518
01:47:26,252 --> 01:47:28,311
What the fuck?

1519
01:47:31,390 --> 01:47:32,379
Fuck.

1520
01:47:32,559 --> 01:47:34,459
What do you mean,
off the building?

1521
01:47:34,627 --> 01:47:37,323
- Something came off the fucking roof.
- It's a fucking body.

1522
01:47:46,038 --> 01:47:47,938
We can't get a visual.
Want us to get out?

1523
01:47:48,108 --> 01:47:50,872
We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.

1524
01:47:51,478 --> 01:47:52,968
- Where were you?
- What happened?

1525
01:47:53,147 --> 01:47:54,944
You're fucking late! Get in the van!

1526
01:47:55,115 --> 01:47:56,480
What do you mean,
off the roof?

1527
01:47:56,650 --> 01:47:58,311
What's going on? I came to meet you.

1528
01:47:58,484 --> 01:48:00,008
- What the fuck...?
- Get in the van!

1529
01:48:00,187 --> 01:48:03,122
I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?

1530
01:48:03,290 --> 01:48:05,349
No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.

1531
01:48:05,526 --> 01:48:07,653
- Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
- I need information.

1532
01:48:07,828 --> 01:48:09,193
What came off the roof?

1533
01:48:09,363 --> 01:48:10,853
- No pursuit.
- That's bullshit.

1534
01:48:11,031 --> 01:48:12,794
Fuck this.

1535
01:48:20,874 --> 01:48:22,501
Fitzy! Get in the van!

1536
01:48:24,011 --> 01:48:26,946
Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!

1537
01:48:27,114 --> 01:48:28,741
All right. I got him.

1538
01:48:35,189 --> 01:48:37,384
32X to CP. We're being fired upon!

1539
01:48:37,559 --> 01:48:40,960
<i>An officer is down. I repeat,
an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!</i>

1540
01:48:41,129 --> 01:48:43,154
<i>Send some back...</i>

1541
01:49:00,515 --> 01:49:03,678
So do you know
why Queenan went into that building?

1542
01:49:03,852 --> 01:49:05,683
- No.
- Well, a better question...

1543
01:49:05,854 --> 01:49:08,015
...is why the fuck
were your guys following him?

1544
01:49:08,189 --> 01:49:10,919
I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.

1545
01:49:11,092 --> 01:49:13,492
- Why?
- That's Internal Investigations' business.

1546
01:49:14,394 --> 01:49:16,055
Fucking piece of shit!

1547
01:49:16,231 --> 01:49:17,721
- All right.
- Hey, hey!

1548
01:49:17,899 --> 01:49:19,264
- Fucking bitch!
- Let him go!

1549
01:49:19,434 --> 01:49:22,597
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain
anything to anybody!

1550
01:49:22,770 --> 01:49:24,931
I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!

1551
01:49:25,106 --> 01:49:27,336
- Come on!
- I don't give a fuck what you think!

1552
01:49:27,508 --> 01:49:30,909
I got reason to believe that Queenan
got killed by his fucking undercover.

1553
01:49:31,079 --> 01:49:32,171
That's a fucking lie.

1554
01:49:32,347 --> 01:49:35,908
He has fucking information
in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.

1555
01:49:36,084 --> 01:49:37,676
I need access to those files.

1556
01:49:37,853 --> 01:49:40,879
I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'll give it to you.

1557
01:49:41,055 --> 01:49:43,182
- That's a fucking lie.
- Nobody calls me a liar!

1558
01:49:43,358 --> 01:49:46,156
Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unlock those files.

1559
01:49:46,327 --> 01:49:49,194
- Dignam, take a leave of absence.
- Take a leave of what?

1560
01:49:49,365 --> 01:49:52,300
Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.

1561
01:49:52,467 --> 01:49:54,833
I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.

1562
01:49:55,003 --> 01:49:58,404
World needs plenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.

1563
01:49:58,573 --> 01:50:00,040
Good.

1564
01:50:01,877 --> 01:50:03,469
- Piece of shit.
- Fuck off.

1565
01:50:05,414 --> 01:50:07,245
- I need those codes.
- No.

1566
01:50:07,415 --> 01:50:09,542
You want those codes.

1567
01:50:12,655 --> 01:50:14,384
So where the fuck were you?

1568
01:50:16,058 --> 01:50:18,618
Well, boss told me to go home.

1569
01:50:18,793 --> 01:50:22,991
Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you weren't at fucking home.

1570
01:50:23,165 --> 01:50:24,632
So where the fuck were you?

1571
01:50:25,234 --> 01:50:28,135
I was at the grocery store
with no signal, all right?

1572
01:50:28,304 --> 01:50:30,295
When I got the signal, I got the call.

1573
01:50:30,471 --> 01:50:33,497
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

1574
01:50:33,676 --> 01:50:35,735
Billy. Billy.

1575
01:50:42,117 --> 01:50:43,641
Yeah?

1576
01:50:45,855 --> 01:50:47,846
Yeah?

1577
01:50:48,324 --> 01:50:50,485
You know what I thought today?

1578
01:50:52,294 --> 01:50:53,989
What's that?

1579
01:50:54,997 --> 01:50:58,455
Who didn't show up today is the rat.

1580
01:51:01,937 --> 01:51:03,302
Yeah?

1581
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:08,140
- So?
- And you never been late in your life.

1582
01:51:10,045 --> 01:51:12,275
When I called you...

1583
01:51:12,449 --> 01:51:14,679
...I made a mistake.

1584
01:51:14,850 --> 01:51:18,650
I gave you the wrong address...

1585
01:51:18,821 --> 01:51:22,655
...but you showed up at the right one...

1586
01:51:23,125 --> 01:51:25,025
...didn't you?

1587
01:51:26,295 --> 01:51:28,855
Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?

1588
01:51:30,132 --> 01:51:31,463
Tell me why.

1589
01:51:54,357 --> 01:51:57,758
That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.

1590
01:51:57,926 --> 01:51:59,723
He's dead.

1591
01:51:59,896 --> 01:52:01,523
I'm going home.

1592
01:52:01,698 --> 01:52:04,496
<i>- Your guys should not have done that.
- One of us had to die.</i>

1593
01:52:04,667 --> 01:52:06,692
With me it tends to be the other guy.

1594
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:08,337
But Queenan.
Now I got no access.

1595
01:52:08,505 --> 01:52:11,702
You killed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

1596
01:52:11,875 --> 01:52:14,537
<i>- He resigned.
- I don't give a fuck about Dignam.</i>

1597
01:52:14,711 --> 01:52:16,178
<i>He put in his papers, Frank.</i>

1598
01:52:16,346 --> 01:52:20,407
- He left. I don't know where he is.
- Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.

1599
01:52:20,583 --> 01:52:22,016
<i>That Irish pissant...</i>

1600
01:52:22,185 --> 01:52:25,848
...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.

1601
01:52:26,022 --> 01:52:28,081
<i>Let's give him a whiff.</i>

1602
01:52:28,258 --> 01:52:31,921
- I will.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1603
01:52:33,597 --> 01:52:35,258
Sweetheart.

1604
01:52:35,432 --> 01:52:37,627
You're giving me a hard-on.

1605
01:52:38,234 --> 01:52:39,633
Are you sure it's me?

1606
01:52:40,137 --> 01:52:43,402
Not all that talk
about whiffing and crawling up asses?

1607
01:52:43,874 --> 01:52:45,865
Watch your fucking mouth.

1608
01:52:46,042 --> 01:52:48,476
No. You watch it.

1609
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:51,478
Let me straighten you out.

1610
01:52:59,390 --> 01:53:02,257
I tried to call you a few times.

1611
01:53:05,463 --> 01:53:07,226
I know.

1612
01:53:33,625 --> 01:53:37,527
Listen, I can't be a friend to you.

1613
01:53:42,666 --> 01:53:44,566
I'm sorry.

1614
01:53:51,041 --> 01:53:52,770
Yeah...

1615
01:53:57,349 --> 01:53:58,976
...I know.

1616
01:56:07,613 --> 01:56:09,103
Yeah.

1617
01:56:09,915 --> 01:56:13,146
You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.

1618
01:56:13,587 --> 01:56:15,145
Who are you?

1619
01:56:15,388 --> 01:56:17,652
So it is you.

1620
01:56:18,858 --> 01:56:21,850
Well, thank God you're all right.
We were very worried.

1621
01:56:23,262 --> 01:56:24,889
Who are you?

1622
01:56:25,798 --> 01:56:27,823
This is Sergeant Sullivan.

1623
01:56:28,001 --> 01:56:29,764
I'm taking over Queenan's unit.

1624
01:56:30,469 --> 01:56:32,494
Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.

1625
01:56:32,673 --> 01:56:34,004
<i>Staff Sergeant Dignam...</i>

1626
01:56:34,173 --> 01:56:37,370
...is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.

1627
01:56:37,544 --> 01:56:39,739
We're all very upset.

1628
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:43,144
<i>I think the best thing would be
for you to come in.</i>

1629
01:56:44,117 --> 01:56:47,018
We need you to come in.
Can you come in?

1630
01:56:48,488 --> 01:56:49,477
<i>We'll meet...</i>

1631
01:57:28,663 --> 01:57:30,961
<i>Police confirm
the body of the man found dead...</i>

1632
01:57:31,131 --> 01:57:33,099
<i>...in the Fenway marshes
yesterday...</i>

1633
01:57:33,267 --> 01:57:36,259
<i>...is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...</i>

1634
01:57:36,437 --> 01:57:38,928
<i>...the city of Boston.
This was the scene yesterday...</i>

1635
01:57:39,106 --> 01:57:42,075
<i>...when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.</i>

1636
01:57:42,242 --> 01:57:43,800
<i>As for who did this or why...</i>

1637
01:57:43,978 --> 01:57:46,378
<i>...that's something police
are working on right now.</i>

1638
01:57:46,546 --> 01:57:50,004
- I don't believe it.
- What can't you believe?

1639
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:53,708
I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

1640
01:57:53,887 --> 01:57:55,821
Tell me how they found him so fast.

1641
01:57:55,990 --> 01:57:58,618
Somebody walking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?

1642
01:57:58,792 --> 01:58:00,953
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

1643
01:58:01,129 --> 01:58:03,256
Must have been a big fucking dog, man.

1644
01:58:03,431 --> 01:58:05,661
I spent all fucking night doing it, man.

1645
01:58:06,032 --> 01:58:07,329
I'm embarrassed.

1646
01:58:08,002 --> 01:58:10,664
I still don't believe he was a cop.
I don't believe it.

1647
01:58:10,838 --> 01:58:15,366
The cops are saying he's a cop...

1648
01:58:15,743 --> 01:58:17,938
...so I won't look for the cop.

1649
01:58:19,213 --> 01:58:20,840
Are you soft, Fitz?

1650
01:58:21,015 --> 01:58:25,975
When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh...

1651
01:58:26,154 --> 01:58:29,089
...you dump him in the marsh.

1652
01:58:30,124 --> 01:58:33,423
Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday...

1653
01:58:33,595 --> 01:58:35,688
...to get a fucking blowjob!

1654
01:58:36,464 --> 01:58:38,625
Don't laugh!

1655
01:58:39,467 --> 01:58:42,368
This ain't reality TV!

1656
01:58:46,307 --> 01:58:48,070
Proceed.

1657
01:59:10,531 --> 01:59:11,998
- What?
- Yeah.

1658
01:59:12,167 --> 01:59:14,931
You got a tail. Two cars.
Not very subtle.

1659
01:59:15,103 --> 01:59:18,664
They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.

1660
01:59:18,841 --> 01:59:19,967
So get rid of them.

1661
01:59:20,142 --> 01:59:23,236
There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.

1662
01:59:23,412 --> 01:59:25,642
Get rid of the fucking tail!

1663
01:59:30,586 --> 01:59:32,144
All right.

1664
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:41,657
Fucking rats.
It's wearing me thin.

1665
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:44,628
Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.

1666
02:00:00,950 --> 02:00:04,283
Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello.
There's no need to surveil him.

1667
02:00:04,454 --> 02:00:06,820
- What are you saying?
- I got it from an undercover.

1668
02:00:06,989 --> 02:00:09,651
He knows he's being followed.
So let the UC take him in.

1669
02:00:09,858 --> 02:00:11,223
- Undercover?
- Queenan's guy.

1670
02:00:11,393 --> 02:00:14,055
He called when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.

1671
02:00:14,229 --> 02:00:17,164
- You give him to me.
- No, I can give you Costello's destination.

1672
02:00:17,367 --> 02:00:19,835
- You know where he's going?
- Yes. And what he's doing.

1673
02:00:20,003 --> 02:00:22,164
Get rid of the tail,
get Special Ops on standby.

1674
02:00:22,337 --> 02:00:24,771
- We'll take this prick tonight.
- Let's go. Now.

1675
02:00:24,941 --> 02:00:27,933
All units fall back.
All units fall back.

1676
02:00:48,298 --> 02:00:50,357
It's the warehouse he owns
over on Sheffield.

1677
02:00:50,533 --> 02:00:53,127
He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.

1678
02:01:17,428 --> 02:01:18,952
Load it.

1679
02:01:26,970 --> 02:01:29,268
Frank, how do you know
you don't have a tail, huh?

1680
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:32,508
Were you not in the fucking car?

1681
02:01:32,676 --> 02:01:35,736
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

1682
02:01:38,948 --> 02:01:40,745
Load.

1683
02:01:48,325 --> 02:01:50,156
Go, go!

1684
02:01:52,596 --> 02:01:54,154
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

1685
02:01:56,233 --> 02:01:58,360
Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.

1686
02:01:58,535 --> 02:02:01,993
- Watch your fucking back.
- Move out! Go on!

1687
02:02:11,015 --> 02:02:13,449
Cocksuckers.

1688
02:02:19,456 --> 02:02:22,016
Motherfucking shit!

1689
02:02:25,463 --> 02:02:27,124
Motherfucking...!

1690
02:02:30,534 --> 02:02:32,798
Back the fuck up!

1691
02:02:32,971 --> 02:02:35,064
They fucking shot me.

1692
02:02:38,776 --> 02:02:39,902
Get down!

1693
02:02:42,913 --> 02:02:44,471
Come on, fucking bastards!

1694
02:03:03,201 --> 02:03:04,668
Fuck it.

1695
02:03:44,109 --> 02:03:47,875
How the fuck did this happen?

1696
02:03:49,281 --> 02:03:51,875
You're an FBI informant?

1697
02:03:52,050 --> 02:03:54,245
Are you fucking kidding me?

1698
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:57,415
Grow up.

1699
02:03:58,123 --> 02:04:01,058
Of course I talk to the FBI.

1700
02:04:01,227 --> 02:04:02,717
Do they know who I am?

1701
02:04:04,663 --> 02:04:09,032
I never gave up anybody
who wasn't going down anyway.

1702
02:04:10,068 --> 02:04:12,502
Nobody knows nothing.

1703
02:04:14,105 --> 02:04:15,595
Frank.

1704
02:04:15,908 --> 02:04:18,809
Frank. Frank.

1705
02:04:18,978 --> 02:04:20,969
Do they know about me?

1706
02:04:22,681 --> 02:04:25,206
I know about you, Collie.

1707
02:04:25,384 --> 02:04:28,217
You know I'd never give you up.

1708
02:04:28,954 --> 02:04:31,718
- You're like a...
- What? Like a son?

1709
02:04:32,625 --> 02:04:35,992
To you? Is that what this is about?

1710
02:04:36,962 --> 02:04:41,296
All that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.

1711
02:05:03,322 --> 02:05:05,756
Fucking rat prick!

1712
02:05:27,347 --> 02:05:28,939
<i>Frank?</i>

1713
02:05:29,115 --> 02:05:30,605
Yeah?

1714
02:05:32,352 --> 02:05:33,580
Who's this?

1715
02:05:35,488 --> 02:05:37,115
Gwen?

1716
02:05:38,257 --> 02:05:40,350
Where the hell's Frank?

1717
02:05:41,427 --> 02:05:43,224
Frank got shot.

1718
02:05:46,065 --> 02:05:48,465
Gwen, we lost Frank.

1719
02:05:56,843 --> 02:05:58,470
I got him!

1720
02:05:58,645 --> 02:06:01,079
I got Costello here!

1721
02:06:05,218 --> 02:06:07,709
Hey, good job, sarge.

1722
02:06:08,488 --> 02:06:10,046
No, it's...

1723
02:06:11,458 --> 02:06:13,050
For you.

1724
02:06:14,127 --> 02:06:17,187
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

1725
02:06:20,701 --> 02:06:23,932
He's been waiting here
a long time for you.

1726
02:06:24,137 --> 02:06:26,571
How'd you get him without the files?

1727
02:06:26,740 --> 02:06:29,538
Caller ID on Queenan's phone.

1728
02:06:30,510 --> 02:06:31,875
You know that guy?

1729
02:06:32,046 --> 02:06:34,913
Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.

1730
02:06:42,355 --> 02:06:44,016
Good to see you, trooper.

1731
02:06:44,191 --> 02:06:46,853
- Yeah.
- Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.

1732
02:06:47,027 --> 02:06:48,585
- Yeah.
- So.

1733
02:06:50,130 --> 02:06:51,893
Now, how long were you undercover?

1734
02:06:52,066 --> 02:06:53,966
Long time.

1735
02:06:54,134 --> 02:06:55,965
- Long fucking time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1736
02:06:56,370 --> 02:07:01,307
Well, I can't even tell you the debt...

1737
02:07:04,145 --> 02:07:07,478
I just want you to know I'll be
recommending you for the Medal of Merit.

1738
02:07:07,648 --> 02:07:09,343
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1739
02:07:10,284 --> 02:07:12,650
That's kind of like a gold star
around here, huh?

1740
02:07:14,689 --> 02:07:16,486
It's the highest honor we got.

1741
02:07:16,657 --> 02:07:19,455
Look, I just want
my identity back, all right?

1742
02:07:19,627 --> 02:07:21,618
- That's all.
- All right.

1743
02:07:21,796 --> 02:07:24,697
- I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
- No, no.

1744
02:07:24,865 --> 02:07:28,460
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

1745
02:07:28,736 --> 02:07:31,705
Check your computer. Go on.
You'll have to excuse my behavior.

1746
02:07:31,872 --> 02:07:35,831
My only contact in the last six months
has been a police shrink.

1747
02:07:38,479 --> 02:07:40,777
How's that working for you?

1748
02:07:40,949 --> 02:07:42,678
Is it helpful?

1749
02:07:43,417 --> 02:07:46,181
What are you gonna do
about Costello's rat in this building?

1750
02:07:48,790 --> 02:07:52,021
- I'm gonna find the prick.
- Yeah.

1751
02:07:52,461 --> 02:07:55,157
I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.

1752
02:07:55,329 --> 02:07:58,492
- Good.
- Anything you can do to help me...

1753
02:07:58,666 --> 02:08:02,500
You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name...? You know, anything.

1754
02:08:02,670 --> 02:08:05,264
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

1755
02:08:05,439 --> 02:08:07,999
I'm all done being a cop, all right?

1756
02:08:08,176 --> 02:08:10,337
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

1757
02:08:10,511 --> 02:08:12,911
All right. That'll be
the best thing for everybody.

1758
02:08:13,081 --> 02:08:14,480
Fair enough.

1759
02:08:15,083 --> 02:08:19,543
I just, I can't get into your file
unless I have your password.

1760
02:08:21,722 --> 02:08:22,746
It's my name.

1761
02:08:23,558 --> 02:08:25,924
William Costigan Jr.

1762
02:08:26,094 --> 02:08:29,359
They gave it to me in case I had to
explain myself to someone like you.

1763
02:08:29,931 --> 02:08:31,865
It's your name.

1764
02:08:33,969 --> 02:08:35,368
All right.

1765
02:08:35,537 --> 02:08:38,233
Fucking unreal, that...
Well, makes a lot of sense.

1766
02:08:38,407 --> 02:08:40,637
Listen, Bill, I gotta run this
in the other room.

1767
02:08:40,809 --> 02:08:43,073
This computer's getting
all frigging blooey on me.

1768
02:08:43,245 --> 02:08:47,011
Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.

1769
02:10:20,344 --> 02:10:24,178
All right, everything checks out,
so let's get you paid.

1770
02:10:55,145 --> 02:10:56,908
I know.

1771
02:10:58,448 --> 02:11:00,939
I know. I'm not...
I'm not here for that, okay?

1772
02:11:01,217 --> 02:11:02,809
I'm not.

1773
02:11:05,022 --> 02:11:08,287
Listen. I've gotta give you something.

1774
02:11:08,458 --> 02:11:10,892
Something I need you to keep.

1775
02:11:11,061 --> 02:11:12,653
For me.

1776
02:11:14,932 --> 02:11:16,524
Okay?

1777
02:11:20,137 --> 02:11:24,437
- What is it?
- This is for you to hold. Only you.

1778
02:11:24,609 --> 02:11:28,568
You open this if something happens to me
or if I call you and I tell you to open it.

1779
02:11:28,746 --> 02:11:31,306
You're the only person
I can trust, all right?

1780
02:11:32,917 --> 02:11:34,509
Please.

1781
02:11:38,055 --> 02:11:40,455
- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry to even...

1782
02:11:40,625 --> 02:11:43,321
I'm sorry to even show up here
like this, you know?

1783
02:11:43,494 --> 02:11:46,759
I... There's just no one else
I could give it to.

1784
02:11:48,199 --> 02:11:50,360
There's no one else.

1785
02:11:51,135 --> 02:11:53,865
- I'm really sorry.
- I...

1786
02:11:54,471 --> 02:11:56,439
You know, I have...

1787
02:11:56,608 --> 02:11:59,042
- I...
- Whatever you have to say...

1788
02:11:59,210 --> 02:12:01,405
...think about it real hard, all right?

1789
02:12:01,578 --> 02:12:05,105
If you still wanna tell me,
you tell me in two weeks, okay?

1790
02:12:34,879 --> 02:12:36,813
I was dreaming I was dead.

1791
02:12:38,182 --> 02:12:42,380
Death is hard. Life is much easier.

1792
02:12:43,321 --> 02:12:46,552
- What's this?
- Open it.

1793
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:58,062
- Really?
- Yeah.

1794
02:12:59,103 --> 02:13:00,570
Really?

1795
02:13:01,239 --> 02:13:02,763
Yeah.

1796
02:13:02,940 --> 02:13:06,501
And they say
that this little speck...

1797
02:13:06,678 --> 02:13:08,873
...is a penis.

1798
02:13:12,151 --> 02:13:14,016
It's a boy.

1799
02:13:14,185 --> 02:13:16,983
Yeah, well,
one usually follows the other.

1800
02:13:18,490 --> 02:13:20,481
Can you still...?

1801
02:14:11,043 --> 02:14:13,034
<i>I hope I won't have to remind you...</i>

1802
02:14:13,212 --> 02:14:17,410
<i>...that if you don't find this cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...</i>

1803
02:14:17,583 --> 02:14:21,246
<i>...you can assume it won't be me
who pays for it.</i>

1804
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:24,253
<i>Now, why would you
have to remind me of that?</i>

1805
02:14:24,424 --> 02:14:29,726
<i>Would I...? Would I be any good at what
I do if I didn't fucking already know that?</i>

1806
02:14:29,895 --> 02:14:33,092
<i>Frank, you gotta trust me.
I can get the rat.</i>

1807
02:14:33,265 --> 02:14:35,631
<i>You just gotta let me do it
my way, Frank.</i>

1808
02:14:35,802 --> 02:14:39,203
<i>Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.</i>

1809
02:14:39,372 --> 02:14:43,240
<i>Hey, it fucking involves lying and
I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?</i>

1810
02:14:46,913 --> 02:14:48,471
What?

1811
02:14:52,085 --> 02:14:53,575
What?

1812
02:14:55,889 --> 02:14:58,187
<i>- We got a cop in my crew.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

1813
02:14:58,358 --> 02:15:02,317
<i>- I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
- He's one of yours. Inside.</i>

1814
02:15:02,495 --> 02:15:03,826
<i>- You seen anything?
- Frank.</i>

1815
02:15:03,997 --> 02:15:07,592
<i>I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.</i>

1816
02:15:07,767 --> 02:15:12,329
<i>- I'm doing my...
- You know what, I thought I was the liar.</i>

1817
02:15:12,506 --> 02:15:15,441
Hey, I can explain that!

1818
02:15:20,614 --> 02:15:22,639
Costello recorded everything.

1819
02:15:22,816 --> 02:15:27,378
He put all the tapes in a box and kept them
with his lawyer. That was his insurance.

1820
02:15:27,554 --> 02:15:29,044
His lawyer came to me.

1821
02:15:29,222 --> 02:15:30,985
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

1822
02:15:31,157 --> 02:15:33,148
<i>Costello trusted me more than anyone.</i>

1823
02:15:33,827 --> 02:15:37,024
Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.

1824
02:15:37,530 --> 02:15:40,124
- What do you want?
- I told you I want my identity back...

1825
02:15:40,301 --> 02:15:42,326
...you two-faced faggot.

1826
02:15:42,635 --> 02:15:46,469
- All right, where are you?
- Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

1827
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:48,574
You keep your cell on.

1828
02:16:00,688 --> 02:16:02,451
Open the door.

1829
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:10,453
Open... Didn't we already talk about this?

1830
02:16:11,632 --> 02:16:13,793
This is my job.

1831
02:16:39,059 --> 02:16:41,050
- Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
- Hey!

1832
02:16:41,228 --> 02:16:42,752
Put the fucking gun down!

1833
02:16:42,930 --> 02:16:46,161
Put the gun down, all right?
I came here to talk some sense into you.

1834
02:16:46,333 --> 02:16:47,891
- Hands!
- Just act professional.

1835
02:16:48,069 --> 02:16:50,094
- I can get you your money.
- What did you say?

1836
02:16:50,271 --> 02:16:53,866
- I can get you your money.
- You didn't come here to talk, all right?

1837
02:16:54,041 --> 02:16:57,010
- You came here to get arrested.
- You got fucking tapes? Of what?

1838
02:16:57,177 --> 02:17:00,669
Costello was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.

1839
02:17:00,849 --> 02:17:02,840
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

1840
02:17:03,018 --> 02:17:04,883
Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!

1841
02:17:05,052 --> 02:17:07,452
What is this, a citizen's arrest?
Blow me, all right?

1842
02:17:07,622 --> 02:17:10,455
Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.
You understand that, Bill?

1843
02:17:10,625 --> 02:17:12,525
- No one knows you.
- Shut the fuck up!

1844
02:17:12,694 --> 02:17:15,959
I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State Police. Who the fuck are you?

1845
02:17:16,131 --> 02:17:19,259
- I erased you!
- You erased me, huh?

1846
02:17:19,434 --> 02:17:22,096
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.

1847
02:17:22,270 --> 02:17:24,738
This bullet would
go right through your fucking head!

1848
02:17:24,906 --> 02:17:27,602
- Watch what happens!
- What, so you can get the parade, huh?

1849
02:17:27,776 --> 02:17:32,236
The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!

1850
02:17:32,414 --> 02:17:35,178
- That's the stupidest thing you could do.
- Shut the fuck up!

1851
02:17:37,919 --> 02:17:40,149
I could give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.

1852
02:17:40,322 --> 02:17:42,017
I'm still fucking arresting you.

1853
02:17:42,457 --> 02:17:44,357
Get up.

1854
02:17:45,527 --> 02:17:48,553
Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.

1855
02:17:48,731 --> 02:17:51,256
I called you. You specifically. Look:

1856
02:17:51,433 --> 02:17:54,800
You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I told you to meet me downstairs.

1857
02:17:54,970 --> 02:17:57,939
Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!

1858
02:17:58,106 --> 02:18:00,233
Where's Dignam?
I told you to bring Dignam!

1859
02:18:00,409 --> 02:18:02,639
Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot!

1860
02:18:02,811 --> 02:18:06,508
- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?

1861
02:18:06,681 --> 02:18:11,345
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!

1862
02:18:13,755 --> 02:18:15,689
Maybe you do.

1863
02:18:15,858 --> 02:18:17,985
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

1864
02:18:18,159 --> 02:18:21,128
I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, all right?

1865
02:18:21,296 --> 02:18:24,265
- Would you shoot this fucking prick!
- You know who I am.

1866
02:18:24,433 --> 02:18:26,526
- You know who I am.
- Shoot this fucking prick.

1867
02:18:26,702 --> 02:18:28,897
I'm taking him downstairs now.

1868
02:18:32,208 --> 02:18:34,039
You know who I am.

1869
02:18:59,168 --> 02:19:01,033
Shut up.

1870
02:19:02,071 --> 02:19:05,097
I can't wait to see you explain this
to a Suffolk County jury...

1871
02:19:05,274 --> 02:19:06,468
...you fucking cocksucker.

1872
02:19:06,642 --> 02:19:09,167
This is gonna be fucking fun.

1873
02:19:20,323 --> 02:19:22,621
Just fucking kill me.

1874
02:19:24,227 --> 02:19:26,388
Just fucking kill me.

1875
02:19:28,665 --> 02:19:30,724
I am killing you.

1876
02:20:06,937 --> 02:20:09,667
Did you think you were the only one
he had on the inside?

1877
02:20:09,906 --> 02:20:12,204
Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.

1878
02:20:12,375 --> 02:20:14,070
It's you and me now, you understand?

1879
02:20:14,244 --> 02:20:17,111
We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?

1880
02:20:30,727 --> 02:20:32,319
Give me that.

1881
02:20:47,745 --> 02:20:51,112
<i>Right. Slow. March.</i>

1882
02:20:59,323 --> 02:21:01,518
<i>I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...</i>

1883
02:21:01,691 --> 02:21:06,219
<i>...at which time he drew down on me,
and I was able to squeeze off one shot...</i>

1884
02:21:06,397 --> 02:21:08,558
<i>...and strike him in the head.</i>

1885
02:21:08,733 --> 02:21:11,167
<i>At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...</i>

1886
02:21:11,335 --> 02:21:13,530
<i>...on both
Troopers Brown and Costigan...</i>

1887
02:21:13,704 --> 02:21:16,867
...and discovered that they had expired.

1888
02:21:20,044 --> 02:21:22,308
I just wanna go on record.

1889
02:21:23,047 --> 02:21:27,006
I'm recommending William Costigan
for the Medal of Merit.

1890
02:21:37,995 --> 02:21:40,327
- Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.
- Ready?

1891
02:21:40,499 --> 02:21:43,400
- And let perpetual light shine upon him.
- Fold.

1892
02:21:43,568 --> 02:21:46,366
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1893
02:21:46,537 --> 02:21:48,869
May his soul and the souls...

1894
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:53,875
...of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

1895
02:21:54,045 --> 02:21:55,637
Amen.

1896
02:22:25,076 --> 02:22:27,306
Detail. Half left. Face.

1897
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:30,671
Prepare to fire.

1898
02:22:30,916 --> 02:22:32,543
Fire.

1899
02:22:32,718 --> 02:22:35,209
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1900
02:22:36,121 --> 02:22:39,147
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1901
02:22:39,591 --> 02:22:42,890
Detail. Half right. Face.

1902
02:22:56,309 --> 02:22:58,675
I'll catch up with you guys.

1903
02:23:05,951 --> 02:23:07,782
What about the baby?

1904
02:23:25,504 --> 02:23:27,131
Hi, pup.

1905
02:23:58,671 --> 02:24:00,298
Okay.
