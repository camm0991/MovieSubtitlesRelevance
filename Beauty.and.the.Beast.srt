1
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,915
Once upon a time, in a faraway land,

2
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,751
a young prince lived
in a shining castle.

3
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,047
Although he had everything
his heart desired,

4
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:34,552
the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.

5
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,055
But then, one winter's night,

6
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,808
an old beggar woman came
to the castle

7
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,728
and offered him a single rose

8
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,231
in return for shelter from the bitter cold.

9
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,901
Repulsed by her haggard appearance,

10
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:54,697
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away.

11
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,284
But she warned him
not to be deceived by appearances,

12
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,454
for beauty is found within.

13
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:06,334
And when he dismissed her again,
the old woman's ugliness melted away

14
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,338
to reveal a beautiful enchantress.

15
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,591
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too iate,

16
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,261
for she had seen
that there was no love in his heart.

17
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,387
And as punishment,

18
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,098
she transformed him
into a hideous beast

19
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:25,895
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle and all who lived there.

20
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,440
Ashamed of his monstrous form,

21
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:32,360
the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle

22
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:36,614
with a magic mirror as his only window
to the outside world.

23
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,493
The rose she had offered

24
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,037
was truly an enchanted rose,

25
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,707
which would bloom until his 21st year.

26
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,460
lf he could learn to love another

27
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:54,215
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell,

28
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,218
then the spell would be broken.

29
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,763
if not, he wouid be doomed

30
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,724
to remain a beast for all time.

31
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,478
As the years passed,

32
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:11,941
he fell into despair and lost all hope,

33
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:17,238
for who could ever learn
to love a beast?

34
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:48,102
Little town, it's a quiet village

35
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:53,232
Every day like the one before

36
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:58,321
Little town, full of little people

37
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:03,534
Waking up to say...

38
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,584
There goes the baker
with his tray, like always

39
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,795
The same old bread and rolls to sell

40
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,631
Every morning just the same

41
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,591
Since the morning that we came

42
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,343
To this poor provincial town

43
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,219
-Good morning, Belle.
-Morning, monsieur.

44
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,013
-Where you off to?
-The bookshop.

45
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,390
I just finished the most wonderful story

46
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,060
-about a beanstalk and an ogre and...
-That's nice.

47
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,313
Marie, the baguettes! Hurry up!

48
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:36,025
Look, there she goes
The girl is strange, no question

49
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,362
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

50
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,322
Never part of any crowd

51
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,240
'Cause her head's up on some cloud

52
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:47,411
No denying she's a funny girl
that Belle

53
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,246
-Bonjour
-Good day

54
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,248
How is your family?

55
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,209
-Bonjour
-Good day

56
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,002
How is your wife?

57
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,921
I need six eggs

58
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,339
That's too expensive

59
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:03,135
There must be more
than this provincial life

60
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,096
-Belle.
-Good morning.

61
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,931
I've come to return the book I borrowed.

62
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,057
Finished already?

63
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,018
I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?

64
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,603
Not since yesterday.

65
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:16,065
That's all right. I'll borrow this one.

66
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,526
That one? But you've read it twice.

67
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,985
Well, it's my favorite.

68
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,407
Far-off places, daring sword fights,
magic spells, a prince in disguise.

69
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,243
If you like it all that much, it's yours.

70
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,120
-But, sir...
-I insist.

71
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,331
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

72
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,001
Look, there she goes
That girl is so peculiar

73
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,296
I wonder if she's feeling well

74
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,173
With a dreamy, far-off look

75
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,092
And her nose stuck in a book

76
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,887
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

77
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:53,185
Isn't this amazing?

78
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,646
It's my favorite part

79
00:05:55,731 --> 00:06:02,236
Because you'll see

80
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,617
Here's where she meets
Prince Charming

81
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,788
But she won't discover that it's him

82
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:16,125
Till chapter three

83
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,960
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!

84
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,672
Now it's no wonder
that her name means beauty

85
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,967
Her looks have got no parallel

86
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,677
But behind that fair facade

87
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,721
l'm afraid she's rather odd

88
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,681
Very different from the rest of us

89
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,433
She's nothing like the rest of us

90
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,395
Yes, different from the rest of us
is Belle

91
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,195
Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston.

92
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,197
You're the greatest hunter
in the whole world!

93
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,865
-I know.
-No beast alive

94
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,784
stands a chance against you.

95
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,703
-And no girl, for that matter.
-It's true, LeFou.

96
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:55,372
And I've got my sights set on that one.

97
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,583
-The inventor's daughter?
-She's the one.

98
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,044
-The lucky girl I'm going to marry.
-But she...

99
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,129
-The most beautiful girl in town.
-I know, but...

100
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,340
That makes her the best.

101
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,552
-And don't I deserve the best?
-Well, of course. I mean, you do.

102
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:12,473
Right from the moment
when i met her, saw her

103
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,851
I said she's gorgeous, and I fell

104
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,895
Here in town there's only she

105
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,772
Who is beautiful as me

106
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:24,026
So I'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle

107
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,903
Look, there he goes

108
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,738
Isn't he dreamy?

109
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,532
Monsieur Gaston

110
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,325
Oh, he's so cute

111
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,118
Be still, my heart

112
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,578
I'm hardly breathing

113
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:38,916
He's such a tall, dark, strong
and handsome brute

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,584
-Bonjour
-Good day

115
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,503
-You call this bacon?
-What lovely grapes

116
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,754
-Some cheese
-Ten yards

117
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,172
-Excuse me
-I'll get the knife

118
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,132
-Please let me through
-This bread, it's staie

119
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,426
-Those fish, they smell
-Madame's mistaken

120
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,097
There must be more
than this provincial life

121
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:57,393
Just watch, I'm going
to make Belle my wife

122
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,938
Look, there she goes
a girl who's strange but special

123
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,149
A most pecuIiar mademoiselle

124
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,943
It's a pity and a sin

125
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,736
She doesn't quite fit in

126
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,780
'Cause she really is a funny girl

127
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,574
A beauty but a funny girl

128
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:16,579
She really is a funny girl

129
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,791
That Belle

130
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,841
-Hello, Belle.
-Bonjour, Gaston.

131
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,926
Gaston, may I have my book, please?

132
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,554
How can you read this?
There's no pictures.

133
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,931
Well, some people
use their imagination.

134
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,851
Belle, it's about time you got
your head out of those books

135
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,478
and paid attention
to more important things.

136
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,813
Like me.

137
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,901
The whole town's talking about it.

138
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,819
It's not right for a woman to read.

139
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,488
Soon she starts getting ideas
and thinking.

140
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,908
Gaston, you are positively primeval.

141
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,910
Why, thank you, Belle.

142
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,245
What do you say you and me
take a walk over to the tavern

143
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,498
-and take a look at my trophies?
-Maybe some other time.

144
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,334
-What's wrong with her?
-She's crazy.

145
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,835
He's gorgeous.

146
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,547
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home to help my father.

147
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,215
Goodbye.

148
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,053
That crazy old loon.
He needs all the help he can get.

149
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,930
Don't talk about my father that way.

150
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,515
Yeah! Don't talk
about her father that way.

151
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,226
My father is not crazy. He's a genius.

152
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,826
-Papa?
-How on earth did that happen?

153
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,122
-Doggone it!
-Are you all right, Papa?

154
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,793
I'm... I'm about ready
to give up on this hunk ofjunk.

155
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,672
-You always say that.
-I mean it this time!

156
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,633
I'll never get this
boneheaded contraption to work!

157
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,637
Yes, you will. And you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.

158
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,099
And become a world-famous inventor.

159
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,226
You really believe that?

160
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,103
I always have.

161
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:08,399
Well, what are we waiting for?
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.

162
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,694
Hand me that...
The dog-legged clincher there.

163
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,613
So, did you have a good time
in town today?

164
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,949
I got a new book.

165
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,910
Papa, do you think I'm odd?

166
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,413
My daughter? Odd?

167
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,415
Where would you get an idea like that?

168
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:28,711
I don't know.
It's just that I'm not sure I fit in here.

169
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,671
There's no one I can really talk to.

170
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,216
What about that Gaston?
He's a handsome fella.

171
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,345
He's handsome, all right,
and rude and conceited and...

172
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,097
Papa, he's not for me.

173
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,266
Well, don't you worry.

174
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,020
'Cause this invention's gonna be
the start of a new life for us.

175
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,273
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.

176
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,748
-It works!
-It does?

177
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,126
-It does!
-You did it.

178
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,170
You really did it!

179
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,256
Hitch up Philippe, girl. I'm off to the fair!

180
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,510
Goodbye, Papa. Good luck.

181
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,555
Goodbye, Belle.
Take care while I'm gone.

182
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,950
We should be there by now.

183
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,244
Maybe we missed a turn.

184
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,456
I guess I should've taken...
Wait a minute.

185
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,879
No. Let's go this way.

186
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,685
Come on, Philippe, it's a shortcut.
We'll be there in no time.

187
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,834
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?

188
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,086
We better turn around.

189
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:39,800
Whoa. Whoa, boy.
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.

190
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,972
Look out! No!

191
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,184
Whoa!

192
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,228
Whoa, boy!

193
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,982
Back up, back up, back up!

194
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:59,069
Good boy. Good boy.
That's good, that's... Back up!

195
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,822
Steady, steady, now. Steady.

196
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,825
Steady. No, Philippe!

197
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,625
Philippe?

198
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,279
Help! Is... Is someone there?

199
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,406
Help!

200
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,652
Hello?

201
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,114
Hello!

202
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,492
Poor fellow must have lost his way
in the woods.

203
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,995
Keep quiet. Maybe he'll go away.

204
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,039
Is someone there?

205
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,542
Not a word, Lumiere. Not one word.

206
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:41,838
I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse

207
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,716
and I need a place to stay for the night.

208
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,261
Cogsworth, have a heart.

209
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,100
Of course, monsieur,
you are welcome here.

210
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,143
Who said that?

211
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,770
Over here.

212
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,939
-Where?
-Hello.

213
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,194
Incredible!

214
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,029
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.

215
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,365
Splendid. Just peachy.

216
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,494
-How is this accomplished?
-Put me down at once.

217
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,705
Stop that! Stop that, I say!

218
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,839
Sir, close that at once!

219
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,383
-Do you mind?
-I beg your pardon.

220
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,928
It's... It's just
that I've never seen a clock that...

221
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,647
You are soaked to the bone, monsieur.

222
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,691
Come. Warm yourself by the fire.

223
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,986
-Thank you.
-No, no, no!

224
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,113
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

225
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,699
I demand that you stop right there.

226
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:55,287
No, no. Not the master's chair.

227
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,042
I'm not seeing this. I'm not seeing this.

228
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,878
Well, hello there, boy.

229
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,427
-What service.
-All right.

230
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,555
This has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here...

231
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,934
How would you like a nice spot of tea,
sir? It'll warm you up in no time.

232
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,271
No. No tea. No tea!

233
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,109
His mustache tickles, Mama.

234
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,196
Hello.

235
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,296
There's a stranger here.

236
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:49,591
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.

237
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,718
He was cold and wet, so...

238
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,474
Master, I'd like to take this moment
to say

239
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,726
I was against this from the start.
It was all his fault.

240
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:03,355
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no...

241
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,404
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

242
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,656
I... I... I was lost in the woods and...

243
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,574
You are not welcome here!

244
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,326
I... I'm... I'm sorry.

245
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:19,329
-What are you staring at?
-Nothing.

246
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:22,833
So, you've come to stare
at the Beast, have you?

247
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,503
Please, I meant no harm!
I just needed a place to stay.

248
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:31,341
-I'll give you a place to stay!
-No, no, please! No! No!

249
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:40,725
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get
the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?

250
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,061
Yep, this is her lucky day.

251
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,860
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

252
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:53,280
First, I better go in there
and propose to the girl.

253
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,493
And you, LeFou, now,
when Belle and I come out that door...

254
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,163
I know. I know. I strike up the band!

255
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,793
-Not yet.
-Sorry.

256
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,058
Gaston, what a pleasant surprise.

257
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,437
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.

258
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,355
You know, Belle,
there's not a girl in town

259
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,025
who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.

260
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,776
This is the day...

261
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,240
This is the day your dreams come true.

262
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,076
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

263
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,913
Plenty! Here. Picture this.

264
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:48,752
A rustic hunting lodge,
my latest kill roasting on the fire

265
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,255
and my little wife massaging my feet

266
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,716
while the little ones play on the floor
with the dogs.

267
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,135
-We'll have six or seven.
-Dogs?

268
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,762
No, Belle.

269
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,598
-Strapping boys like me.
-Imagine that.

270
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,016
Do you know who that little wife will be?

271
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,060
-Let me think.
-You, Belle.

272
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,980
Gaston, I'm... I'm speechless.

273
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,441
I really don't know what to say.

274
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:14,903
-Say you'll marry me.
-I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...

275
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,698
But I just don't deserve you!

276
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,382
So, how'd it go?

277
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,427
I'll have Belle for my wife.

278
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,305
Make no mistake about that.

279
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,183
Touchy.

280
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,900
Is he gone?

281
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,989
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.

282
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,909
Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless...

283
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,287
Madame Gaston

284
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,205
Can't you just see it?

285
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,249
Madame Gaston

286
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,084
His little wife

287
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,671
No, sir, not me, I guarantee it

288
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:19,259
I want much more
than this provincial life

289
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:33,273
I want adventure
in the great wide somewhere

290
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,152
I want it more than I can tell

291
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:41,197
And for once it might be grand

292
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,909
To have someone understand

293
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:52,500
I want so much more
than they've got planned

294
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:59,341
Philippe! What are you doing here?
Where's... Where's Papa?

295
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,093
Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?

296
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,305
We have to find him.
You have to take me to him.

297
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,695
What is this place?

298
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,199
Philippe, please, steady.

299
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,452
Steady.

300
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,332
Papa!

301
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,669
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

302
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,213
Just had to invite him to stay,
didn't we?

303
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,676
Serve him tea, sit in the master's chair.
Pet the pooch.

304
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,427
I was trying to be hospitable.

305
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,013
Hello?

306
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,265
Is anyone here?

307
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,351
Hello?

308
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,605
Papa? Papa?

309
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,024
Are you here?

310
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,319
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.

311
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,406
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

312
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,616
Really, Mama. I saw her.

313
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,952
-Not another word. Into the tub.
-But... What?

314
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,122
A girl. I saw a girl in the castle.

315
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,374
See, I told you.

316
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:18,920
Irresponsible, devil-may-care,
waxy-eared, slack-jawed...

317
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,088
Papa?

318
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:23,383
Did you see that?

319
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,430
-It's a girl!
-I know it's a girl.

320
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,683
Don't you see? She's the one.
The girl we have been waiting for.

321
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,519
-She has come to break the spell.
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

322
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:42,235
Papa?

323
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,865
Hello? Is someone here?

324
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,243
Wait! I'm looking for my father. I...

325
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,541
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.

326
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,170
Is anyone here?

327
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,630
-Belle?
-Papa!

328
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,676
How did you find me?

329
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,596
Your hands are like ice.
We have to get you out of there.

330
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,681
Belle, I want you to leave this place.

331
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:12,849
Who's done this to you?

332
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,435
No time to explain. You must go. Now!

333
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,812
-I won't leave you.
-What are you doing here?

334
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,105
Run, Belle!

335
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,650
-Who's there? Who are you?
-The master of this castle.

336
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,361
I've come for my father.

337
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,697
Please let him out.
Can't you see he's sick?

338
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:29,991
Then he shouldn't
have trespassed here!

339
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,702
But he could die.
Please, I'll do anything.

340
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:36,581
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.

341
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,958
There must be some way I can...

342
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:40,960
Wait!

343
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,927
-Take me instead.
-You?

344
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,765
You would take his place?

345
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,059
Belle, no!
You don't know what you're doing!

346
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,145
If I did, would you let him go?

347
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,775
Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.

348
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,987
Come into the light.

349
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,585
No, Belle! I won't let you do this!

350
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,674
-You have my word.
-Done.

351
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,181
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.

352
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,266
Wait.

353
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,392
-Belle!
-Wait.

354
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,688
No! Please spare my daughter. Please!

355
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:45,108
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.

356
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,944
Let me out. Please let me out!

357
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:52,198
Let me out! Please! Please!

358
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,539
-Master?
-What?

359
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,376
Since the girl is going to be with us
for quite some time,

360
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,172
I was thinking that you might want
to offer her a more comfortable room.

361
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,426
Then again, maybe not.

362
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,472
You didn't even let me say goodbye.

363
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,558
I'll never see him again.

364
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,227
I didn't get to say goodbye.

365
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,439
I'll show you to your room.

366
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,066
My room? But I thought...

367
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,485
You wanna...
You wanna stay in the tower?

368
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,904
-No.
-Then follow me.

369
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,260
Say something to her.

370
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,182
I hope you like it here.

371
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:02,894
The castle is your home now,

372
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,939
so you can go anywhere you like,
except the west wing.

373
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,650
-What's in the west...
-It's forbidden!

374
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,118
Now, if you need anything,
my servants will attend you.

375
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,412
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.

376
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:25,625
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!

377
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,104
Who does she think she is?

378
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,356
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.

379
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,484
-No one says no to Gaston.
-Darn right.

380
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:55,863
Dismissed. Rejected.
Publicly humiliated.

381
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,907
Why, it's more than I can bear.

382
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:01,411
-More beer?
-What for? Nothing helps.

383
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,497
-I'm disgraced.
-Who, you? Never.

384
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,751
Gaston, you've got
to pull yourself together.

385
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,255
Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston

386
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,425
Looking so down in the dumps

387
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,761
Every guy here'd
love to be you, Gaston

388
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,764
Even when taking your lumps

389
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,892
There's no man in town
as admired as you

390
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,479
You're everyone's favorite guy

391
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,816
Everyone's awed
and inspired by you

392
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,944
And it's not very hard

393
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:38,865
To see why

394
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:45,163
No one's slick as Gaston

395
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,748
No one's quick as Gaston

396
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:50,084
No one's neck's
as incredibly thick as Gaston

397
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,796
For there's no man in town
half as manly

398
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,591
Perfect, a pure paragon

399
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,927
You can ask any
Tom, Dick or Stanley

400
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:05,391
And they'll tell you
whose team they prefer to be on

401
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:09,687
No one's been like Gaston

402
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,355
A kingpin like Gaston

403
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,650
No one's got a swell cleft
in his chin like Gaston

404
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:18,571
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating

405
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,616
My, what a guy, that Gaston

406
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,994
Give five hurrahs
Give 12 hip-hips

407
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:29,665
Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips

408
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:34,837
No one fights like Gaston

409
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,506
Douses lights like Gaston

410
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,842
In a wrestling match
nobody bites like Gaston

411
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:43,221
For there's no one
as burly and brawny

412
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,516
As you see, I've got biceps to spare

413
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,311
-Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny
-That's right

414
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,356
And every last inch of me's
covered with hair

415
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,567
-No one hits like Gaston
-Matches wits like Gaston

416
00:28:56,652 --> 00:29:00,029
In a spitting match
nobody spits like Gaston

417
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:03,908
I'm especially good at expectorating

418
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,036
Ten points for Gaston

419
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:10,039
When I was a lad
I ate four dozen eggs

420
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:13,626
Every morning to help me get large

421
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,712
And now that I'm grown
I eat five dozen eggs

422
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:22,802
So I'm roughly the size of a barge

423
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:27,682
No one shoots like Gaston

424
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,392
Makes those beauts like Gaston

425
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,687
Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston

426
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,732
I use antlers in all of my decorating

427
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:39,235
My, what a guy

428
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:45,283
Gaston

429
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,206
-Help! Someone help me!
-Maurice?

430
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,500
Please! Please, I need your help.

431
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:57,253
He's got her...
He's got her locked in the dungeon.

432
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,338
-Who?
-Belle. We must go.

433
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,215
Not... Not a minute to lose.

434
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,593
Whoa! Slow down, Maurice.

435
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,470
-Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
-A beast!

436
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,182
A horrible, monstrous beast!

437
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,564
-Is it a big beast?
-Huge.

438
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,567
-With a long, ugly snout?
-Hideously ugly.

439
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,112
-And sharp, cruel fangs?
-Yes, yes! Will you help me?

440
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,948
All right, old man. We'll help you out.

441
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:29,785
You will?
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

442
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,373
Crazy old Maurice.

443
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:37,251
He's always good for a laugh.

444
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,630
Crazy old Maurice?

445
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,508
Crazy old Maurice.

446
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:49,180
LeFou, I'm afraid I've been thinking

447
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,848
A dangerous pastime

448
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,099
I know

449
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,478
But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father

450
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,648
And his sanity's only so-so

451
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:01,984
Now, the wheels in my head
have been turning

452
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,196
Since I looked at that loony old man

453
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,699
See, I promised myself
I'd be married to Belle

454
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:13,329
And right now, I'm evolving a plan

455
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,498
-If I...
-Yes?

456
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,626
-Then we...
-No, would she?

457
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,336
-Guess.
-Now I get it!

458
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,672
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

459
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:26,759
No one plots like Gaston

460
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,469
Takes cheap shots like Gaston

461
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,847
Plans to persecute harmless crackpots
like Gaston

462
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:37,520
So, his marriage
we soon will be celebrating

463
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,106
My, what a guy

464
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,443
Gaston

465
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,283
Will no one help me?

466
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,252
-Who is it?
-Mrs. Potts, dear.

467
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:05,256
I thought you might like a spot of tea.

468
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,341
But you're... You're a...

469
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,387
-Careful.
-This is impossible.

470
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,056
I know it is, but here we are.

471
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,976
I told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't I?

472
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,355
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now. Don't spill.

473
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,233
Thank you.

474
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,319
Wanna see me do a trick?

475
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:30,740
-Chip!
-Sorry.

476
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,409
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

477
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,952
We all think so.

478
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:38,581
But I've lost my father,
my dreams, everything.

479
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:43,294
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.

480
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,962
You'll see.

481
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,672
Listen to me jabbering on

482
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,924
while there's a supper
to get on the table.

483
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,760
Chip?

484
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,178
Bye.

485
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:55,431
Well, now,
what shall we dress you in for dinner?

486
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,434
Let's see what I got in my drawers.

487
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,227
How embarrassing!

488
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:06,108
Here we are.
You'll look ravishing in this one.

489
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:09,570
That's very kind of you,
but I'm not going to dinner.

490
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,697
But you must.

491
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,370
Dinner is served.

492
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,499
What's taking so long?

493
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,334
I told her to come down.

494
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,921
-Why isn't she here yet?
-Try to be patient, sir.

495
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,299
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day.

496
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:31,884
Master, have you thought

497
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,804
that perhaps this girl could be the one
to break the spell?

498
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:37,640
Of course I have! I'm not a fool.

499
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,476
Good! So, you fall in love with her,

500
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,188
she falls in love with you, and poof!
The spell is broken.

501
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,482
We'll be human again by midnight.

502
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,068
It's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.

503
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,821
But the rose has already begun to wilt.

504
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,739
It's no use.

505
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,242
She's so beautiful and I'm...

506
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,952
Well, look at me!

507
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,040
You must help her to see past all that.

508
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,875
I don't know how.

509
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,503
Well, you can start
by making yourself more presentable.

510
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,964
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.

511
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,968
Yes. When she comes in,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.

512
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,345
Come, come, show me the smile.

513
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:20,391
-But don't frighten the poor girl.
-Impress her with your rapier wit.

514
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,642
But be gentle.

515
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,019
-Shower her with compliments.
-But be sincere.

516
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,521
And above all,

517
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,607
-you must control your temper!
-You must control your temper!

518
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,109
Here she is!

519
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:33,612
Good evening.

520
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,408
-Well, where is she?
-Who?

521
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,203
The girl, yes. The girl.

522
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:45,166
Well, actually, she's in the process of...

523
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,670
Circumstances being what they are...
She's not coming.

524
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,881
What?

525
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,050
Oh, dear. Your Grace! Your Eminence!

526
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,511
Let's not be hasty!

527
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,224
I thought I told you
to come down to dinner!

528
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,851
I'm not hungry.

529
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:07,688
You'll come out or I'll... I'll...
I'll break down the door!

530
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,607
Master, I could be wrong,

531
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:14,236
but that may not be the best way
to win the girl's affections.

532
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:17,698
Please attempt to be a gentleman.

533
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,493
But she is being so difficult.

534
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,953
Gently, gently.

535
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:27,416
-Will you come down to dinner?
-No!

536
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,003
Suave, genteel.

537
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:34,048
It would give me great pleasure

538
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,926
if you would join me for dinner.

539
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,719
And we say "please."

540
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,596
-Please.
-No, thank you.

541
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,890
-You can't stay in there forever!
-Yes, I can.

542
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:47,478
Fine! Then go ahead and starve!

543
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:52,191
If she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all!

544
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,656
Oh, dear.
That didn't go very well at all, did it?

545
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,617
Lumiere, stand watch at the door

546
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,954
and inform me at once
if there is the slightest change.

547
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,540
You can count on me, mon capitaine.

548
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:11,835
Well, we might as well go downstairs
and start cleaning up.

549
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,506
I ask nicely, but she refuses.

550
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,592
What does she want me to do, beg?

551
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,470
Show me the girl.

552
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:27,268
But the master's really not so bad,
once you get to know him.

553
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,353
Why don't you give him a chance?

554
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,230
I don't want to get to know him.

555
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,233
I don't want to have anything
to do with him.

556
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,987
I'm just fooling myself.

557
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,948
She'll never see me as anything

558
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,533
but a monster.

559
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,290
It's hopeless.

560
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,018
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

561
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,770
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes, yes, yes.

562
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,315
I've been burned by you before.

563
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,570
Zut aIors¡ She has emerged!

564
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,120
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

565
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,873
But I'm not sleepy.

566
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,043
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

567
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:37,671
I work and I slave all day long,
and for what?

568
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,674
A culinary masterpiece gone to waste!

569
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,761
Stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.

570
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:47,014
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

571
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,682
After all, he did say "please."

572
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,518
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper,

573
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,854
-he'll never break the...
-Splendid to see you

574
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,564
out and about, mademoiseIIe.

575
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:58,317
I am Cogsworth, head of the household.

576
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,739
-This is Lumiere.
-Enchanté, chérie.

577
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,034
If there's, stop that,
anything we, please,

578
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,287
can do to make your stay
more comfortable...

579
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:12,706
-I am a little hungry.
-You are?

580
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,541
Hear that? She's hungry.

581
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,711
Stoke the fire.
Break out the silver. Wake the china.

582
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,422
Remember what the master said.

583
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,550
Pish tosh. I'm not about
to let the poor child go hungry.

584
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,553
All right, fine. Glass of water,
crust of bread and then...

585
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,514
Cogsworth, I am surprised at you.

586
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,934
She's not a prisoner. She's our guest.

587
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,604
We must make her feel welcome here.
Right this way, mademoiseIIe.

588
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,523
Well, keep it down.

589
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,025
If the master finds out about this,
it will be our necks.

590
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,944
Of course, of course.

591
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,030
But what is dinner
without a little music?

592
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:46,865
Music?

593
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:54,289
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

594
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:56,208
that we welcome you tonight.

595
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,919
And now, we invite you to relax.

596
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:03,841
Let us pull up a chair,
as the dining room proudly presents

597
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,342
your dinner.

598
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:11,640
Be our guest, be our guest

599
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,934
Put our service to the test

600
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,603
Tie your napkin
'round your neck, chérie

601
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,605
And we provide the rest

602
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,899
Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres

603
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,152
Why, we only live to serve

604
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,487
Try the gray stuff, it's delicious

605
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,823
Don't believe me?
Ask the dishes

606
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,075
They can sing, they can dance

607
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,578
After aii, miss, this is France

608
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:36,498
And a dinner here
is never second best

609
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,042
Go on, unfold your menu

610
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:42,254
Take a glance
and then you'll be our guest

611
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,507
Oui, ourguest
Be our guest

612
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,885
Beef ragout, cheese soufflé

613
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,012
Pie and pudding, en flambé

614
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,930
We'll prepare and serve with flair

615
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,183
A culinary cabaret

616
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,518
You're alone and you're scared

617
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,604
But the banquet's all prepared

618
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,731
No one's gloomy or complaining

619
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,941
While the flatware's entertaining

620
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,943
We tell jokes, I do tricks

621
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,196
With my fellow candlesticks

622
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,031
Und it's all in perfect taste

623
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,200
That you can bet

624
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,368
Come on and lift your glass

625
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,454
You've won your own free pass

626
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,622
To be our guest

627
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:20,000
If you're stressed
it's fine dining we suggest

628
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,169
Be our guest, be our guest

629
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,087
Be our guest

630
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:28,050
Life is so unnerving

631
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,594
For a servant who's not serving

632
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,889
He's not whole
without a soul to wait upon

633
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,516
Get off!

634
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:37,601
Those good old days

635
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,436
When we were useful

636
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:44,316
Suddenly, those good old days
are gone

637
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,236
Ten years we've been rusting

638
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,905
Needing so much more than dusting

639
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,365
Needing exercise

640
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,660
A chance to use our skills

641
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:59,748
Most days
we just lay around the castle

642
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,458
Flabby, fat and lazy

643
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,460
You walked in and oops-a-daisy

644
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,379
It's a guest, it's a guest

645
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,130
Sakes aiive, weii, i'ii be biessed

646
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,924
Wine's been poured
and thank the Lord

647
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,968
I've had the napkins freshly pressed

648
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,970
with dessert, she'ii want tea

649
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,972
And, my dear, that's fine with me

650
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,807
While the cups do their soft-shoeing

651
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,851
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing

652
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,727
I'll get warm, piping hot

653
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,729
Heaven sakes, is that a spot?

654
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:26,108
Clean it up
We want the company impressed

655
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,318
We've got a lot to do

656
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,237
Is it one lump or two?

657
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,530
For you, our guest

658
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,407
-She's our guest
-She's our guest

659
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,741
Be our guest

660
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,493
Be our guest, be our guest
Our command is your request

661
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:37,953
Let's go, people. Fun's over.
Over here. Line up.

662
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,789
It's 10 years
since we've had anybody here

663
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:41,957
And we're obsessed

664
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,834
With your meal, with your ease

665
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,878
Yes, indeed, we aim to please

666
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,463
While the candlelight's still glowing

667
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:53,093
Let us help you, we'll keep going

668
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:57,389
Course by course

669
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,641
One by one

670
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:02,394
Till you shout, "Enough, I'm done!"

671
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:06,231
Then we'll sing you off to sleep
as you digest

672
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,317
Tonight, you'll prop your feet up

673
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,152
But for now, let's eat up

674
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:15,073
Be our guest

675
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:18,702
Please be our

676
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:24,541
Guest

677
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:30,672
-Bravo! That was wonderful.
-Thank you.

678
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:36,094
Thank you, mademoiseIIe.
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!

679
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:41,516
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.

680
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,019
I couldn't possibly go to bed now.

681
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,021
It's my first time in an enchanted castle.

682
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,439
Enchanted!

683
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:51,526
Who said anything
about the castle being enchanted?

684
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,195
It was you, wasn't it?

685
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,405
I figured it out for myself.

686
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,618
I'd like to look around, if that's all right.

687
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,829
-Would you like a tour?
-Wait a second. Wait a second.

688
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,374
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

689
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:09,169
We can't let her go poking around
in certain places,

690
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,712
if you know what I mean.

691
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,214
Perhaps you'd like to take me.

692
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,717
I'm sure you know everything there is
to know about the castle.

693
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,679
Well. Actually, I...

694
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,097
Yes, I do.

695
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,851
As you can see,
the pseudo-facade was stripped away

696
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,396
to reveal the minimalist Rococo design.

697
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,190
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

698
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,902
This is yet another example
of the late-neoclassic Baroque period.

699
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:37,531
And, as I always say,
if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.

700
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,618
Where was I?

701
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:43,954
As you were!

702
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:49,418
Now, then, if I may draw your attention
to the flying buttresses above the...

703
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,502
Mademoiselle?

704
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:59,052
-What's up there?
-Where? There? Nothing.

705
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,221
Absolutely nothing of interest at all
in the west wing.

706
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,306
Dusty, dull, very boring.

707
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,768
So, that's the west wing!

708
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,228
Nice going.

709
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:11,440
I wonder what he's hiding up there.

710
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:15,444
-Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.
-Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

711
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:19,948
Perhaps mademoiseIIe would like
to see something else?

712
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:22,617
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

713
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,870
-Maybe later.
-The gardens.

714
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,122
Or... Or the... The library, perhaps?

715
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,082
You have a library?

716
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,209
-Yes. Indeed.
-With books.

717
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,754
-Scads of books.
-Mountains of books.

718
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,255
-Forests of books.
-Cascades.

719
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,882
-Cloudbursts.
-Swamps of books.

720
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:39,634
More books than you'll ever be able
to read in a lifetime.

721
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,803
Books on every subject ever studied

722
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:44,681
by every author
who ever set pen to paper.

723
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:28,076
-Why did you come here?
-I'm... I'm sorry.

724
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:31,872
-I warned you never to come here!
-I didn't mean any harm.

725
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:34,666
Do you realize
what you could have done?

726
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:36,918
Please! Stop!

727
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:39,171
-Get out!
-No!

728
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,426
Get out!

729
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:56,938
Where are you going?

730
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:00,317
Promise or no promise,
I can't stay here another minute.

731
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:03,028
No, wait, please! Please, wait!

732
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,146
No!

733
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:32,427
Here, now. Don't do that.

734
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,308
Just hold still.

735
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,186
That hurts!

736
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,188
If you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

737
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:45,440
Well, if you hadn't have run away,
this wouldn't have happened.

738
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,985
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.

739
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:52,072
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing!

740
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:55,158
Well, you should learn
to control your temper.

741
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,914
Now, hold still. This might sting a little.

742
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:08,380
By the way,
thank you for saving my life.

743
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,552
You're welcome.

744
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,897
I don't usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night,

745
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,733
but he said
you'd make it worth my while.

746
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,863
-I'm listening.
-It's like this.

747
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:37,242
I've got my heart set on marrying Belle,

748
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:40,161
but she needs a little persuasion.

749
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,831
Turned him down flat.

750
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:45,875
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.

751
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,337
He was in here tonight
raving about a beast in a castle.

752
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:51,089
Maurice is harmless.

753
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:56,428
The point is, Belle would do anything
to keep him from being locked up.

754
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,889
Yeah, even marry him.

755
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:05,186
So, you want me to throw her father
into the asylum,

756
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,605
unless she agrees to marry you.

757
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,775
That is despicable.

758
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,445
I love it.

759
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:19,117
If no one will help me,
then I'll go back alone.

760
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:22,245
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes.

761
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,831
I'll find that castle and somehow, I...

762
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,958
I'll get her out of there.

763
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,300
-Belle! Maurice!
-Oh, well.

764
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:38,428
Guess it's not gonna work, after all.

765
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,763
They have to come back sometime.

766
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:44,601
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

767
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:50,899
LeFou, don't move from that spot
until Belle and her father come home.

768
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,525
But... But I...

769
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:56,321
Nuts.

770
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,721
I've never felt this way about anyone.

771
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:27,435
I want to do something for her.
But what?

772
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,354
Well, there's the usual things.

773
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:32,941
Flowers, chocolates,
promises you don't intend to keep.

774
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,111
No, no.
It has to be something very special.

775
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:40,406
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute.

776
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:44,202
Belle?

777
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,539
There's something I want to show you.

778
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,834
But first, you have to close your eyes.

779
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,588
It's a surprise.

780
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,768
-Can I open them?
-No, no. Not yet.

781
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,688
Wait here.

782
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:21,072
-Now can I open them?
-All right. Now.

783
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:31,833
I can't believe it.

784
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,377
I've never seen so many books
in all my life.

785
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,755
-You... You like it?
-It's wonderful.

786
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,424
Then it's yours.

787
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,093
Thank you so much.

788
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:45,221
-Would you look at that!
-I knew it would work.

789
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:47,557
What? What works?

790
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:51,060
-It's very encouraging.
-Isn't this exciting?

791
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,438
-I didn't see anything.
-Come along, Chip.

792
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,273
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

793
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,943
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.

794
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:49,744
There's something sweet
and almost kind

795
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:53,539
But he was mean
and he was coarse and unrefined

796
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:57,335
And now he's dear and so unsure

797
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:01,130
I wonder why
I didn't see it there before

798
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,604
She glanced this way

799
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:18,439
I thought I saw

800
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:22,276
And when we touched
she didn't shudder at my paw

801
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:24,153
No, it can't be

802
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,030
I'll just ignore

803
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:30,201
But then she's never looked at me
that way before

804
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:38,459
New and a bit alarming

805
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:41,379
Who'd have ever thought

806
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:47,969
That this could be

807
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,388
True

808
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:54,267
That he's no Prince Charming

809
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,644
But there's something in him

810
00:55:56,729 --> 00:56:01,399
That I simply didn't see

811
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:04,485
-Well, who'd have thought
-Well, bless my soul

812
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,487
-Weii, who'd have known
-Weii, who, indeed

813
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:09,240
And who'd have guessed
they'd come together on their own

814
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,868
-It's so peculiar. Wait and see
-We'll wait and see

815
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,661
A few days more

816
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:17,039
There may be something there
that wasn't there before

817
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:23,337
You know, perhaps there is something
there that wasn't there before

818
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:25,256
What?

819
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:29,093
There may be something there
that wasn't there before

820
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:30,928
What's there, Mama?

821
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,432
I'll tell you when you're older.

822
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:38,478
Right, then,
you all know why we're here.

823
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:41,606
We have exactly 1 2 hours,
36 minutes and 1 5 seconds

824
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:45,193
to create the most magical,
spontaneous, romantic atmosphere

825
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,153
known to man or beast.

826
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,661
Right. Need I remind you

827
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:59,248
that if the last petal falls from this rose

828
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,626
the spell will never be broken?

829
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:06,005
Very well.
You all know your assignments.

830
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,342
Half of you to the west wing,
half of you to the east wing,

831
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,636
the rest of you, come with me.

832
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,936
Lighten up, Cogsworth,
and let nature take its course.

833
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,438
It's obvious there's a spark
between them.

834
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:26,400
Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames, you know, a little.

835
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:32,114
Besides, they must fall in love tonight
if we ever expect to be human again.

836
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,325
-Human again.
-Human again.

837
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,495
Yes, think what that means.

838
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:43,042
I'll be cooking again

839
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,044
Be good-looking again

840
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:48,381
With a mademoiselle on each arm

841
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,842
When I'm human again

842
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,718
Only human again

843
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:56,597
Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm

844
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,432
I'll be courting again

845
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,434
Chic and sporting again

846
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:04,188
Which should cause
several husbands alarm

847
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:05,940
I'll hop down off this shelf

848
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,567
and, tout de suite, be myseIf

849
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:11,112
I can't wait to be human again

850
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,907
When we're human again

851
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,617
Only human again

852
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:20,246
When we're knickknacks
and what-nots no more

853
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,998
When we're human again

854
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:23,708
Good and human again

855
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:27,420
Oh, chéri, won't it all be top-drawer?

856
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,338
I'll wear lipstick and rouge

857
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:31,007
And I won't be so huge

858
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,468
Why, I'll easily fit through that door

859
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,470
I'll exude savoir-faire

860
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,306
I'll wear gowns, I'll have hair

861
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:41,893
It's my prayer to be human again

862
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,482
When we're human again

863
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:50,151
Only human again

864
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:53,529
When the world once more
starts making sense

865
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:55,239
I'll unwind for a change

866
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:56,908
Really? That would be strange

867
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:59,869
Can I help it if I'm tense?

868
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:02,163
In a shack by the sea

869
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,748
I'll sit back sipping tea

870
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:07,126
Let my early retirement commence

871
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,003
Far from fools made of wax

872
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,797
I'll get down to brass tacks and relax

873
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:15,843
When I'm human again

874
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:19,388
So, sweep that dust from the fIoor

875
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:22,516
Let's let some light in the room

876
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,185
i can feei, i can teii

877
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,978
Someone might break the spell

878
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:29,815
Any day now

879
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,777
Shine up the brass on the door

880
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:35,988
Alert the dustbin and broom

881
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,657
If it all goes as planned

882
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,408
Our time may be at hand

883
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:42,995
Any day now

884
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:46,916
Open the shutters
and let in some air

885
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,670
Put these here
and put those over there

886
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:54,090
Sweep up the years
of sadness and tears

887
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:58,803
And throw them away

888
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:06,060
We'll be human again

889
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,770
Only human again

890
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:11,190
When the girl finally sets us all free

891
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,900
Cheeks a-blooming again

892
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:14,652
We're assuming again

893
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:18,072
We'll resume our long lost
joie de vivre

894
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,740
We'll be playing again

895
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:21,575
Holidaying again

896
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:25,079
And we're praying it's ASAP

897
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,747
We will push, we will shove

898
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:28,499
They will both fall in love

899
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:32,753
And we'll finally be human again

900
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:37,258
"For never was a story of more woe

901
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,844
"Than this of Juliet and her Romeo"

902
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:46,434
-Could you read it again?
-Here, why don't you read it to me?

903
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:47,852
All right.

904
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,151
-I can't.
-You mean, you never learned?

905
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:57,695
I learned. A little.

906
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:01,115
It's just been so long.

907
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,409
Well, here, I'll help you.

908
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,828
-Let's start here.
-Here.

909
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,332
-Okay. "Twoh..."
-"Two."

910
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:14,170
"Two." I knew that. "Two households..."

911
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:19,633
We'll be dancing again

912
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:21,469
We'll be twirling again

913
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:24,847
We'll be whirling around
with such ease

914
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,474
When we're human again

915
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:28,184
Only human again

916
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:31,645
We'll go waltzing
those old one-two-threes

917
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,147
We'll be floating again

918
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,982
We'll be gliding again

919
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:38,486
Stepping, striding
as fine as you please

920
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,906
Like a real human does

921
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:45,367
I'll be all that I was

922
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:49,538
On that glorious morn
when we're finally reborn

923
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:53,667
And we're all of us human

924
01:01:53,752 --> 01:02:00,591
Again

925
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,521
Tonight is the night.

926
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:19,110
-I'm not sure I can do this.
-You don't have time to be timid.

927
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:21,445
You must be bold, daring.

928
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:22,988
Bold. Daring.

929
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:30,871
There will be music,
romantic candlelight

930
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:32,665
provided by myself.

931
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:36,043
And when the moment is right,
you confess your love.

932
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,712
Yes, I...

933
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:40,881
I... I... No, I can't.

934
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:44,593
-You care for the girl, don't you?
-More than anything.

935
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,846
Well, then, you must tell her.

936
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,892
VoiIà¡ You look so, so...

937
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:53,894
Stupid.

938
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,730
Not quite the word I was looking for.

939
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:59,275
Perhaps a little more off the top.

940
01:03:03,572 --> 01:03:05,489
Your lady awaits.

941
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,892
Tale as old as time

942
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,980
True as it can be

943
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,402
Barely even friends

944
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:46,113
Then somebody bends

945
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,115
Unexpectedly

946
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,412
Just a little change

947
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:58,709
Small to say the least

948
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,545
Both a little scared

949
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:04,048
Neither one prepared

950
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:07,051
Beauty and the Beast

951
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,598
Everjust the same

952
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:18,562
Ever a surprise

953
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,524
Ever as before

954
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,818
Everjust as sure

955
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:28,489
As the sun will rise

956
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,910
Tale as old as time

957
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:37,748
Tune as old as song

958
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:42,544
Bittersweet and strange

959
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:44,922
Finding you can change

960
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,841
Learning you were wrong

961
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:53,347
Certain as the sun

962
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:57,601
Rising in the east

963
01:04:57,686 --> 01:05:00,104
Tale as old as time

964
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:03,232
Song as old as rhyme

965
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,985
Beauty and the Beast

966
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:12,241
Tale as old as time

967
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:16,620
Song as old as rhyme

968
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:23,252
Beauty and the Beast

969
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:28,090
Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip.
It's past your bedtime.

970
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:32,011
Good night, love.

971
01:05:56,036 --> 01:05:57,202
Belle?

972
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:02,499
Are you happy here with me?

973
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,168
Yes.

974
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,424
What is it?

975
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:15,637
If only I could see my father again,
just for a moment.

976
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:17,431
I miss him so much.

977
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,354
There is a way.

978
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,985
This mirror will show you anything.

979
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,071
Anything you wish to see.

980
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,449
I'd like to see my father, please.

981
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:45,209
Papa. Oh, no.

982
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:49,797
He's sick. He may be dying,
and he's all alone.

983
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:59,223
Then you must go to him.

984
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:01,308
What did you say?

985
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:04,853
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.

986
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:08,774
-You mean I'm free?
-Yes.

987
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:14,404
Thank you.
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.

988
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:19,118
Take it with you

989
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:23,080
so you'll always have a way
to look back and remember me.

990
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:30,587
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.

991
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:43,725
Well, Your Highness, I must say
everything is going just swimmingly.

992
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,687
I knew you had it in you.

993
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:48,856
I let her go.

994
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,941
Yes, yes...

995
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:54,069
You what?

996
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:57,197
-How could you do that?
-I had to.

997
01:07:57,282 --> 01:08:00,075
Yes, but... But why?

998
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,328
Because I love her.

999
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:05,622
He did what?

1000
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:09,877
-Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
-She's going away?

1001
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:12,004
But he was so close.

1002
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:16,550
After all this time,
he's finally learned to love.

1003
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:19,178
That's it then.
That should break the spell.

1004
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:23,140
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.

1005
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,726
Now it's too late.

1006
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:38,280
Papa?

1007
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,087
They're back.

1008
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:57,716
Belle.

1009
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:01,511
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.

1010
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:05,682
I thought I'd never see you again.

1011
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:09,144
-I missed you so much!
-But the Beast...

1012
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:11,897
-Did you... How did you escape?
-I didn't escape, Papa.

1013
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:15,275
-He... He let me go.
-That horrible beast?

1014
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:19,780
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.

1015
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:28,372
-Hi!
-A stowaway.

1016
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:31,333
Why, hello there, little fella.

1017
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,044
Didn't think I'd see you again.

1018
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,713
Belle, why'd you go away?

1019
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:39,216
Don't you like us anymore?

1020
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,177
Chip, of course I do. It's just that...

1021
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:49,226
-May I help you?
-I've come to collect your father.

1022
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,145
-My father?
-Don't worry, mademoiselle.

1023
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,731
We'll take good care of him.

1024
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:59,111
-My father's not crazy!
-He was raving like a lunatic!

1025
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,406
-We all heard him, didn't we?
-Yes!

1026
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:05,951
-No, I won't let you!
-Belle?

1027
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:09,371
Maurice, tell us again, old man.

1028
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:12,124
Just how big was the beast?

1029
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:16,086
He was... I mean, he was...
He was enormous!

1030
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:20,465
I'd... I'd say at least eight,
no, more like 1 0 feet!

1031
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,095
Well, you don't get much crazier
than that.

1032
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,848
It's true, I tell you.

1033
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:31,351
-Get him out of here!
-Let go of me!

1034
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,645
No! You can't do this!

1035
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:38,275
Poor Belle.
It's a shame about your father.

1036
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,902
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

1037
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:45,866
I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding if...

1038
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,785
-If what?
-If you marry me.

1039
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:51,121
-What?
-One little word, Belle.

1040
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,123
-That's all it takes.
-Never!

1041
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:54,541
Have it your way.

1042
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:57,878
Belle? Let go of me!

1043
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,298
My father's not crazy
and I can prove it.

1044
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,050
Show me the Beast.

1045
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:11,391
-Is it dangerous?
-No, no, he'd never hurt anyone.

1046
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:15,520
Please, I know he looks vicious,
but he's really kind and gentle.

1047
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:18,648
-He's my friend.
-If I didn't know better,

1048
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:21,735
I'd think you had feelings
for this monster.

1049
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:24,613
He's no monster, Gaston. You are!

1050
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,116
She's as crazy as the old man.

1051
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,827
The Beast will make off
with your children.

1052
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:32,412
-He'll come after them in the night.
-No.

1053
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:35,374
We're not safe till his head
is mounted on my wall!

1054
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,417
I say we kill the Beast!

1055
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:40,003
We're not safe until he's dead

1056
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:41,797
He'll come stalking us at night

1057
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:43,507
Set to sacrifice our children

1058
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:45,342
To his monstrous appetite

1059
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:47,094
He'll wreak havoc on our village

1060
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:49,012
If we let him wander free

1061
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:52,766
So, it's time to take some action, boys

1062
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:59,106
It's time to follow me

1063
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,651
Through the mist, through the woods
through the darkness and the shadows

1064
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,862
It's a nightmare
but it's one exciting ride

1065
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:09,157
Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle

1066
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:12,369
And there's something
truly terrible inside

1067
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:15,622
It's a beast
He's got fangs, razor-sharp ones

1068
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:19,000
Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast

1069
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:20,669
Hear him roar, see him foam

1070
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,295
But we're not coming home

1071
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:26,550
Till he's dead, good and dead
Kill the Beast!

1072
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,051
No, I won't let you do this.

1073
01:12:28,136 --> 01:12:31,972
If you're not with us, you're against us.
Bring the old man!

1074
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:33,723
Get your hands off me!

1075
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:36,351
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

1076
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:39,938
-Let us out!
-We'll rid the village of this beast!

1077
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,190
-Who's with me?
-I am!

1078
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:43,567
-I am!
-I am!

1079
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:45,110
Light your torch, mount your horse

1080
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,945
Screw your courage
to the sticking place

1081
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,906
We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way

1082
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:53,076
Through a mist, to a wood
where within a haunted castle

1083
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:56,371
Something's lurking
that you don't see every day

1084
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:59,666
It's a beast
One as tall as a mountain

1085
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,919
We won't rest
till he's good and deceased

1086
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,588
Sally forth, tally-ho

1087
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,256
Grab your sword and your bow

1088
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,883
Praise the Lord and here we go

1089
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:11,511
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!

1090
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:15,474
I have to warn the Beast.
This is all my fault.

1091
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:20,103
-Papa, what are we going to do?
-Now, now. We'll think of something.

1092
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:30,113
We don't like
what we don't understand

1093
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:31,239
in fact, it scares us

1094
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:34,451
And this monster
is mysterious at least

1095
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,244
Bring your guns, bring your knives

1096
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:37,621
Save your children and your wives

1097
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:40,957
We'll save our village and our lives

1098
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,125
We'll kill the Beast

1099
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:46,296
I knew it. I knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.

1100
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:50,008
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.

1101
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,469
-Could it be...
-Is it she?

1102
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:54,846
SacrebIeu¡ Invaders!

1103
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:57,140
-Encroachers.
-And they have the mirror.

1104
01:13:57,225 --> 01:13:58,266
Warn the master.

1105
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:00,435
If it's a fight they want,
we'll be ready for them.

1106
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,354
Who's with me?

1107
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,439
Take whatever booty you can find.

1108
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:07,150
But remember, the Beast is mine!

1109
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:09,152
Hearts ablaze, banners high

1110
01:14:09,237 --> 01:14:10,737
We go marching into battle

1111
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:13,740
Unafraid, although the danger
just increased

1112
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:15,575
Raise the flag, sing the song

1113
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,035
Here we come, we're 50 strong

1114
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,288
And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong

1115
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:22,123
Let's kill the Beast

1116
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:25,502
-Pardon me, Master.
-Leave me in peace.

1117
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:28,004
But, sir, the castle is under attack.

1118
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:31,174
Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!

1119
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:36,012
-This isn't working.
-Lumiere, we must do something!

1120
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:37,639
Wait! I know!

1121
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,142
Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!

1122
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:44,312
What shall we do, Master?

1123
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:46,523
It doesn't matter now.

1124
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,024
Just let them come.

1125
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:51,319
Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast!

1126
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:53,196
Kill the Beast!

1127
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:06,668
Now!

1128
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:28,648
Yes!

1129
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,154
Here we go!

1130
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:39,159
What the devil?

1131
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:41,745
Belle, look out!

1132
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,170
You guys gotta try this thing.

1133
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,719
Up here, you scurvy scum.

1134
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,679
Now!

1135
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,334
And stay out.

1136
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:46,035
Get up.

1137
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,621
What's the matter, Beast?

1138
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:52,959
Too kind and gentle to fight back?

1139
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:01,593
No!

1140
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:07,640
-Belle.
-No, Gaston, don't.

1141
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:15,356
Let's go, Philippe.

1142
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:42,342
Come on out and fight!

1143
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:47,514
Were you in love with her, Beast?

1144
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:50,099
Did you honestly think she'd want you

1145
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:52,435
when she had someone like me?

1146
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:08,284
It's over, Beast! Belle is mine!

1147
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,793
Let me go. Let me go.
Please, don't hurt me.

1148
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,962
I'll do anything. Anything!

1149
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:34,394
Get out.

1150
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,146
Beast!

1151
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,399
Belle.

1152
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:49,576
Belle?

1153
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,791
You came back.

1154
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:37,290
You...

1155
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:40,376
You came back.

1156
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:43,922
Of course I came back.
I couldn't let them...

1157
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,591
This is all my fault.

1158
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,468
If only I'd gotten here sooner.

1159
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:53,181
Maybe it's better... It's better this way.

1160
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,683
Don't talk like that.

1161
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,061
You'll be all right.

1162
01:20:58,145 --> 01:21:01,981
We're together now.
Everything's going to be fine, you'll see.

1163
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:07,445
At least I got to see you

1164
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:10,740
one last time.

1165
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,503
No. No.

1166
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:28,508
Please. Please. Please don't leave me.

1167
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:33,846
I love you.

1168
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:15,239
Belle, it's me.

1169
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:32,548
It is you.

1170
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,166
Lumiere.

1171
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,377
Cogsworth.

1172
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:12,255
Mrs. Potts!

1173
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,675
-Look at us.
-Mama. Mama.

1174
01:24:20,514 --> 01:24:24,016
-Oh, my goodness.
-It is a miracle.

1175
01:24:34,862 --> 01:24:36,112
L'amour.

1176
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:43,870
Well, Lumiere, old friend.
Shall we let bygones be bygones?

1177
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:46,789
Of course, mon ami.
I told you she would break the spell.

1178
01:24:46,874 --> 01:24:51,460
I beg your pardon, old friend,
but I believe I told you.

1179
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:53,337
No, you didn't. I told you.

1180
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:55,214
You most certainly did not,

1181
01:24:55,299 --> 01:24:57,341
you pompous,
paraffin-headed pea-brain!

1182
01:24:57,426 --> 01:25:00,553
En garde, you overgrown pocket watch!

1183
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:02,638
-Take that.
-Stop shoving.

1184
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:09,228
Are they gonna live
happily ever after, Mama?

1185
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:11,063
Of course, my dear.

1186
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:13,232
Of course.

1187
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:16,903
Do I still have to sleep in the cupboard?

1188
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:24,035
Certain as the sun

1189
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:27,872
Rising in the east

1190
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,333
Tale as old as time

1191
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:33,085
Song as old as rhyme

1192
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:39,008
Beauty and the Beast

1193
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:41,969
Tale as old as time

1194
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:45,556
Song as old as rhyme

1195
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:51,354
Beauty and the Beast
