00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:16,723 
<i>Beautiful friend</i> 

3 
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:22,937 
<i>This is the end</i> 

4 
00:01:23,062 --> 00:01:25,607 
<i>My only friend</i> 

5 
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:27,692 
<i>The end</i> 

6 
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:31,571 
<i>Of our elaborate plans</i> 

7 
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:33,615 
<i>The end</i> 

8 
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,368 
<i>Of everything that stands</i> 

9 
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:39,412 
<i>The end</i> 

10 
00:01:39,537 --> 00:01:43,416 
<i>No safety nor surprise</i> 

11 
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,502 
<i>The end</i> 

12 
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:51,341 
<i>I'll never look into your eyes</i> 

13 
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:53,510 
<i>Again</i> 

14 
00:01:57,764 --> 00:02:00,475 
<i>Can you picture</i> 

15 
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,852 
<i>What will be</i> 

16 
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:08,149 
<i>So limitless and free</i> 

17 
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:11,945 
<i>Desperately in need</i> 

18 
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,947 
<i>Of some</i>

<i>Wilderness of pain</i> 

24 
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:24,601 
<i>And all the children</i> 

25 
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:28,480 
<i>Are insane</i> 

26 
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:35,695

29 
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,084

30 
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:17,946 
<i>Saigon. </i> 

31 
00:04:19,823 --> 00:04:21,866 
<i>Shit. </i> 

32 
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:25,870 
<i>I'm still only in Saigon. </i> 

33 
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:38,299 
<i>Every time, I think I'm gonna 
wake up back in the jungle. </i> 

34 
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:46,599 
<i>When I was home after 
my first tour, it was worse. </i> 

35 
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:58,445 
<i>I'd wake up, 
and there'd be nothing. </i> 

36 
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:10,290 
<i>I hardly said a word to my wife 
until I said yes to a divorce. </i> 

37 
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:16,129 
<i>When I was here, 
I wanted to be there. </i> 

38 
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:22,093 
<i>When I was there, all I could think 
of was getting back into the jungle. </i> 

39 
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:27,140 
<i>I'm here a week now. </i> 

40 
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:32,687

<i>getting softer. </i> 

42 
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:43,364 
<i>Every minute I stay 
in this room, I get weaker. </i> 

43 
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:48,411 
<i>And every minute Charlie squats 
in the bush, he gets stronger. </i> 

44 
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,920 
<i>Each time I looked around, 
the walls moved in a little tighter. </i> 

45 
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:11,935 
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck 
Yeah</i> 

46 
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,899 
<i>Come on, babe, come on now 
Livin' life, yeah</i> 

47 
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:21,820 
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck 
Yeah</i> 

48 
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:25,323

00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:32,330 
<i>Yeah, do it, yeah, come on</i> 

52 
00:06:34,457 --> 00:06:37,710 
<i>Yeah, all right</i> 

53 
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:57,522 
<i>Yeah</i> 

54 
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:02,444 
<i>Yeah, yeah</i> 

55 
00:07:02,444 --> 00:07:04,821 
<i>Yeah</i> 

56 
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:08,616 
<i>Yeah, yeah</i> 

57 
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:10,827 
<i>Yeah</i> 

58 
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:39,439 
<i>Everyone gets everything he wants. </i> 

59 
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:42,275 
<i>I wanted a mission... </i> 

60 
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,196 
<i>and for my sins, 
they gave me one. </i> 

61 
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:48,698 
<i>Brought it up to me 
like room service. </i> 

62 
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:52,494 
Captain Willard? 
Are you in there? 

63 
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:54,662 
Yeah, I'm comin'. 

64 
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:57,582 
<i>It was a real choice mission. </i> 

65 
00:07:57,707 --> 00:08:02,045 
<i>And when it was over, 
I'd never want another. </i> 

66 
00:08:10,178 --> 00:08:12,847 
- What do you want? 
- Are you all right, Captain? 

67 
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:15,850 
What does it look like? 

68 
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,861 
- Are you Willard, 505th Battalion? 
- Affirmative. 

69 
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:28,863 
- 173rd Airborne? 
- Yeah. 

70 
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:33,493 
- Assigned to SOG? 
- Hey, buddy, gonna shut the door? 

71 
00:08:33,618 --> 00:08:38,206 
We have orders to escort you 
to the airfield. 

72 
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:41,709 
- What are the charges? 
- Sir? 

73 
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:45,130 
- What'd I do? 
- There's no charges, Captain. 

74 
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:49,050 
You have orders to report to 
Com-Sec Intelligence at Nha Trang. 

75 
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:52,053 
- I see. 
- All right? 

76 
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:55,140 
- Nha Trang, for me? 
- That's right. 

77 
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:58,643 
Come on, Captain. You still have 
a few hours to get cleaned up. 

78 
00:08:58,768 --> 00:09:02,772 
- I'm not feeling too good. 
- Captain? 

79 
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:06,109 
Dave, come here and give me a hand. 
We got a dead one. 

80 
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:09,237 
Come on, Captain. 
Let's take a shower. 

81 
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:11,448 
- Don't be an ass. 
- Get a hold of him good. 

82 
00:09:11,573 --> 00:09:13,783 
We're gonna take a shower, Captain. 
In we go. 

83 
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:17,412 
Stand underneath this, Captain. 

84 
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:29,924 
<i>I was going to the worst place 
in the world... </i> 

85 
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:32,802 
<i>and I didn't even know it yet. </i> 

86 
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,889 
<i>Weeks away and hundreds 
of miles up a river... </i> 

87 
00:09:35,972 --> 00:09:39,142 
<i>that snaked through the war 
like a main circuit cable... </i> 

88 
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:41,936 
<i>plugged straight into Kurtz. </i> 

89 
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:46,900 
<i>It was no accident that 
I got to be the caretaker... </i> 

90 
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:49,694 
<i>of Colonel 
Walter E. Kurtz's memory... </i> 

91 
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:54,574 
<i>any more than being back 
in Saigon was an accident. </i> 

92 
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:58,536 
<i>There is no way to tell his story 
without telling my own. </i> 

93 
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:01,247 
<i>If his story 
is really a confession... </i> 

94 
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:03,917 
<i>- Captain Willard reporting, sir. 
- Then so is mine. </i> 

95 
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,170 
- Captain. Good. Come on in. 
- Thank you, sir. 

96 
00:10:07,295 --> 00:10:11,257 
- Stand at ease. 
- General. 

97 
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:14,928 
You want a cigarette? 

98 
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:17,555 
No, thank you, sir. 

99 
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,102 
- Have you ever seen this man before? 
- No, sir. 

100 
00:10:22,227 --> 00:10:24,938 
- Met the general or myself? 
- No, sir. 

101 
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:27,524 
Not personally. 

102 
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:31,361 
- You've worked a lot on your own? 
- Yes, sir, I have. 

103 
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:32,946 
Your report 
specifies intelligence... 

104 
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:34,447 
counterintelligence 
with Com-Sec, "l" Corps. 

105 
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:38,660 
I'm not presently disposed to 
discuss those operations, sir. 

106 
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:49,337 
Did you not work for 
the CIA in "l" Corps? 

107 
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:52,966 
No, sir. 

108 
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:55,760 
Did you not assassinate 
a government tax collector... 

109 
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:58,638 
Quang Tri Province, 
June 18, 1968? 

110 
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:02,642 
Captain? 

111 
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:09,524 
Sir, I am unaware of any 
such activity or operation... 

112 
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:14,779 
nor would I be disposed to 
discuss such an operation... 

113 
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:18,575 
if it did, 
in fact, exist, sir. 

114 
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:31,838 
I thought we'd have 
a bite of lunch while we talk. 

115 
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:35,758 
I hope you brought 
a good appetite, Captain. 

116 
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:40,764 
I notice that you have 
a bad hand there. You wounded? 

117 
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:43,224 
I had a little fishing accident 
on R and R, sir. 

118 
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:46,936 
- Fishing on R and R? 
- Yes, sir. 

119 
00:11:47,061 --> 00:11:49,439 
But you're feeling fit? 
You're ready for duty? 

120 
00:11:49,564 --> 00:11:51,983 
Yes, General. 
Very much so, sir. 

121 
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:57,655 
Well, let's see what we have here, 
roast beef, and usually it's not bad. 

122 
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:02,160 
Try some, Jerry, 
and pass it around. 

123 
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:06,331 
To save a little time, 
we might pass both ways. 

124 
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:11,711 
Captain, I don't know how 
you feel about this shrimp... 

125 
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:13,713 
but if you'll eat it... 

126 
00:12:13,838 --> 00:12:18,468 
you'll never have to prove 
your courage in any other way. 

127 
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:22,472 
I swear, why don't I 
just take a piece here? 

128 
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:26,893 
Captain, you've heard of 
Colonel Walter E. Kurtz? 

129 
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:31,106 
Yes, sir, 
I've heard the name. 

130 
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:35,068 
Oh, Jesus! Operations officer, 
Fifth Special Forces. 

131 
00:12:35,193 --> 00:12:38,738 
Luke, would you play that tape 
for the captain, please? 

132 
00:12:38,863 --> 00:12:41,366 
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. 
- Listen to this carefully, Captain. 

133 
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:46,830 
<i>October 9, 0430 hours, 
sector Peter, Victor, King. </i> 

134 
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:50,125 
These were monitored 
out of Cambodia. 

135 
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,961 
This has been verified 
as Col. Kurtz's voice. 

136

this country's ever produced. 

160 
00:14:28,556 --> 00:14:32,644 
He was brilliant. 
He was outstanding in every way. 

161 
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:38,441 
And he was a good man, too, 
a humanitarian man. 

162 
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:41,569 
A man of wit and humor. 

163 
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:45,657 
He joined the Special Forces. 

164 
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:49,494 
And after that his... 

165 
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:52,705 
ideas, methods... 

166 
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,501 
became... 

167 
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:00,880 
unsound. 

168 
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,387 
Unsound. 

169 
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:15,228 
Now he's crossed 
into Cambodia with this... 

170 
00:15:15,353 --> 00:15:18,606 
Montagnard army of his 
that worship... 

171 
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:21,401 
the man like a god... 

172 
00:15:21,526 --> 00:15:26,406 
and follow every order, 
however ridiculous. 

173 
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:30,660 
Well, I have some other 
shocking news to tell you. 

174 
00:15:30,785 --> 00:15:36,332 
Col. Kurtz was about 
to be arrested for murder. 

175 
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:40,336 
I don't follow, sir. 
Murdered who? 

176 
00:15:40,462 --> 00:15:44,466 
Kurtz had ordered the execution of 
some Vietnamese intelligence agents... 

177 
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:48,511 
men he believed 
were double agents. 

178 
00:15:48,636 --> 00:15:53,808 
So he took matters 
into his own hands. 

179 
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:56,519 
Well, you see, Willard... 

180 
00:15:56,644 --> 00:16:02,275 
in this war, things 
get confused out there. 

181 
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,196 
Power, ideals, 
the old morality... 

182 
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:09,157 
and practical 
military necessity. 

183 
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:14,662 
But out there 
with these natives... 

184 
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:19,459 
it must be a temptation to... 

185 
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,961 
be God. 

186 
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:28,551 
Because there's a conflict 
in every human heart... 

187 
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:32,263 
between the rational 
and the irrational... 

188 
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:35,683 
between good and evil... 

189 
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:38,770 
and good does not 
always triumph. 

190 
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:43,775 
Sometimes... 

191 
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,069 
the dark side... 

192 
00:16:46,194 --> 00:16:50,990 
overcomes what Lincoln called 
the better angels of our nature. 

193 
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:54,911 
Every man has got 
a breaking point. 

194 
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:58,164 
You and I have them. 

195 
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,168 
Walt Kurtz has reached his. 

196 
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:06,965 
And very obviously, 
he has gone insane. 

197 
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:23,106 
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir. 
Obviously insane. 

198 
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:31,197 
Your mission is to proceed up the 
Nung River in a navy patrol boat... 

199 
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:36,286 
pick up Col. Kurtz's path 
at Nu Mung Ba... 

200 
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:39,581 
follow it, learn what 
you can along the way. 

201 
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:43,001 
When you find the colonel, 
infiltrate his team by... 

202 
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:48,006 
whatever means available and 
terminate the colonel's command. 

203 
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,973 
Terminate the colonel? 

204 
00:17:57,098 --> 00:18:02,187 
He's out there operating 
without any decent restraint... 

205 
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:06,316 
totally beyond the pale 
of any acceptable... 

206 
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:08,401 
human conduct... 

207 
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:12,697 
and he is still on the field, 
commanding troops. 

208 
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:16,284 
Terminate with 
extreme prejudice. 

209 
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:20,163 
You understand, Captain, 
that this mission... 

210 
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:24,834 
does not exist 
nor will it ever exist. 

211 
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:24,018 
<i>How many people 
had I already killed? </i> 

212 
00:19:24,144 --> 00:19:27,897 
<i>There were those six 
that I knew about for sure... </i> 

213 
00:19:28,022 --> 00:19:32,444 
<i>close enough to blow 
their last breath in my face. </i> 

214 
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:37,240 
<i>But this time 
it was an American... </i> 

215 
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:39,367 
<i>and an officer. </i> 

216 
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,006 
<i>That wasn't supposed to make 
any difference to me... </i> 

217 
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:55,175 
<i>but it did. </i> 

218 
00:19:56,926 --> 00:20:00,346 
<i>Shit. Charging a man 
with murder in this place... </i> 

219 
00:20:00,472 --> 00:20:06,019 
<i>was like handing out 
speeding tickets at the Indy 500.</i> 

220 
00:20:06,144 --> 00:20:10,523 
<i>I took the mission. 
What the hell else was I gonna do? </i> 

221 
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:16,112 
<i>But I really didn't know 
what I'd do when I found him. </i> 

222 
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:26,122 
- Did you check the tank? 
- Yeah. 

223 
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:32,337 
<i>I was being ferried down 
the coast in a navy PBR... </i> 

224 
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:36,466 
<i>a type of plastic patrol boat... 
a pretty common sight on the rivers. </i> 

225 
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:39,469 
<i>They said it was a good way to 
pick up information and move... </i> 

226 
00:20:39,594 --> 00:20:43,807 
<i>without drawing a lot 
of attention, and that was okay. </i> 

227 
00:20:43,932 --> 00:20:46,893 
<i>I needed the air and the time. </i> 

228 
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:49,312 
<i>Only problem was 
I wouldn't be alone. </i> 

229 
00:20:49,437 --> 00:20:51,523 
Mornin', Captain. 

230 
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:56,903 
<i>The crew were 
mostly just kids... </i> 

231 
00:20:56,986 --> 00:21:00,907 
<i>rock and rollers with 
one foot in their graves. </i> 

232 
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:04,619 
- How old are you? 
- Seventeen. 

233 
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:08,164 
<i>The machinist... the one they 
called Chef... was from New Orleans. </i> 

234 
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:11,167 
<i>He was wrapped too tight 
for Vietnam. </i> 

235 
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:14,003 
<i>Probably wrapped too tight 
for New Orleans. </i> 

236 
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:16,047 
<i>Lance, on the forward fifties... </i> 

237 
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:18,925 
<i>was a famous surfer 
from the beaches south of L.A. </i> 

238 
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:22,846 
<i>To look at him, you wouldn't believe 
he'd ever fired a weapon in his life. </i> 

239 
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:28,935 
<i>Clean... Mr. Clean... was 
from some South Bronx shit-hole... </i> 

240 
00:21:29,018 --> 00:21:31,187 
<i>and I think the light 
and the space of Vietnam... </i> 

241 
00:21:31,312 --> 00:21:34,899 
<i>really put the zap on his head. </i> 

242 
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:38,945 
<i>Then there was Phillips, 
the chief. </i> 

243 
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:42,949 
<i>It might have been my mission, but 
it sure as shit was the chiefs boat. </i> 

244 
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:44,993 
There's about two points 
where we can draw enough water... 

245 
00:21:45,118 --> 00:21:47,495 
to get into the Nung River. 

246 
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,749 
They're both hot. 
Belong to Charlie. 

247 
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,252 
Don't worry about it. 

248 
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:57,464 
Don't smoke. 

249 
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:00,717 
You know, I've pulled 
a few special ops in here. 

250 
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:03,428 
About six months ago... 

251 
00:22:03,553 --> 00:22:07,849 
I took a man who was going up 
past the bridge at Do Lung. 

252 
00:22:07,974 --> 00:22:10,643 
He was regular army too. 

253 
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:16,107 
Heard he shot himself 
in the head. 

254 
00:22:24,032 --> 00:22:27,911 
<i>At first I thought 
they handed me the wrong dossier. </i> 

255 
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:30,580 
<i>I couldn't believe 
they wanted this man dead. </i> 

256 
00:22:32,207 --> 00:22:35,084 
<i>Third-generation West Point, 
top of his class. </i> 

257 
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,422 
<i>Korea, Airborne, 
about a thousand decorations. </i> 

258 
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:41,549 
<i>Et cetera, et cetera. </i> 

259 
00:22:44,135 --> 00:22:49,057 
<i>I'd heard his voice on the tape, 
and it really put the hook in me... </i> 

260 
00:22:49,182 --> 00:22:53,770 
<i>but I couldn't connect up 
that voice with this man. </i> 

261 
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:03,738 
<i>Like they said, 
he had an impressive career. </i> 

262 
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:08,743 
<i>Maybe too impressive. 
I mean, perfect. </i> 

263 
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:13,081 
<i>He was being groomed for one of 
the top slots in the corporation... </i> 

264 
00:23:13,206 --> 00:23:16,501 
<i>general, chief of staff, 
anything. </i> 

265 
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:22,215 
<i>In 1964, he returned from a tour 
with Advisory Command in Vietnam... </i> 

266 
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,676 
<i>and things started to slip. </i> 

267 
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:26,886 
<i>His report to 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff... </i> 

268 
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:29,431 
<i>and Lyndon Johnson was restricted. </i> 

269 
00:23:31,141 --> 00:23:34,894 
<i>Seems they didn't dig 
what he had to tell them. </i> 

270 
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:37,939 
<i>During the next few months, he 
made three requests for transfer... </i> 

271 
00:23:38,064 --> 00:23:43,111 
<i>to Airborne training, Fort Benning, 
Georgia, and was finally accepted. </i> 

272 
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:48,241 
<i>Airborne? </i> 

273 
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:52,871 
<i>He was 38 years old. </i> 

274 
00:23:53,955 --> 00:23:56,249 
<i>Why the fuck would he do that? </i> 

275 
00:23:58,585 --> 00:24:02,839 
<i>1966, joins Special Forces... </i> 

276 
00:24:02,964 --> 00:24:04,924 
<i>returns to Vietnam. </i> 

277 
00:24:05,216 --> 00:24:07,218 
Hey, what's that? 

278 
00:24:07,343 --> 00:24:09,846 
- Arc light. 
- What's up? 

279 
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:12,515 
- B-52 strike. 
- Yeah? 

280 
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,517 
- What's that? 
- Arc light. 

281 
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:17,562 
I hate that. Every time I hear that, 
something terrible happens. 

282 
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:19,564 
Charlie don't never 
see 'em or hear 'em, man. 

283 
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:20,940 
There they are. 

284 
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:23,318 
Concussion will suck the air 
out of your damn lungs. 

285 
00:24:23,443 --> 00:24:25,445 
Something terrible 
is gonna happen. 

286 
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,199 
Smoke! Secondary burning. 

287 
00:24:29,324 --> 00:24:31,826 
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys. 

288 
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:34,829 
Let's have a look, Chief. 

289 
00:24:34,954 --> 00:24:38,541 
<i>It was the Air-Cav. 
First of the Ninth... </i> 

290 
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:39,459 
That's them. 

291 
00:24:39,584 --> 00:24:42,462 
<i>our escorts to the mouth 
of the Nung River. </i> 

292 
00:24:42,587 --> 00:24:46,424 
<i>But they were supposed to be waiting 
for us another 30 kilometers ahead. </i> 

293 
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:51,721 
<i>Well, Air Mobile. 
Those boys just couldn't stay put. </i> 

294 
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:06,361 
Hey, kid, come on. 
Get down. Come on. 

295 
00:25:17,413 --> 00:25:20,291 
<i>First of the Ninth was 
an old cavalry division... </i> 

296 
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:22,293 
<i>that had cashed in its horses 
for choppers... </i> 

297 
00:25:22,418 --> 00:25:26,297 
<i>and gone tear-assing around 
'Nam looking for the shit. </i> 

298 
00:25:26,422 --> 00:25:30,969 
<i>They'd given Charlie 
a few surprises in their time here. </i> 

299 
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:35,932 
<i>What they were mopping up now hadn't 
even happened yet an hour ago. </i> 

300 
00:25:36,057 --> 00:25:38,309 
Just keeping running by. 
We're for television. 

301 
00:25:38,435 --> 00:25:40,728 
Don't look at the camera. 
Just keep... Go on. Keep going. 

302 
00:25:40,854 --> 00:25:42,730 
This is for television. 
Don't look at the camera. 

303 
00:25:42,856 --> 00:25:46,109 
Just go by like you're fighting, 
like you're fighting. 

304 
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:49,779 
Don't look at the camera. 
It's for television. Just go through. 

305 
00:25:49,904 --> 00:25:51,865 
Just go by. Keep on going. 

306 
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,117 
Keep going. Don't look at the camera. 
Go on. Keep going. 

307 
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:56,077 
All right, come on. Go. 

308 
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,126 
Right here. Yes. 
Over here. Over here. 

309 
00:26:17,098 --> 00:26:19,476 
Where can I find the CO? 

310 
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:23,772 
That's the colonel comin' down! 

311 
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,699 
The CO's on that chopper. 

312 
00:26:56,971 --> 00:27:00,475 
Lieutenant, bomb that tree line 
back about 100 yards! 

313 
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,728 
- Give me some room to breathe! 
- Yes, sir! 

314 
00:27:08,483 --> 00:27:09,692 
Body cards! 

315 
00:27:09,818 --> 00:27:11,861 
- Sir? 
- Bring my body cards! 

316 
00:27:11,986 --> 00:27:13,863 
Yes, sir! 

317 
00:27:16,449 --> 00:27:19,702 
I'm the Fourth Tank commander. 
I got five tanks broken down. 

318 
00:27:19,828 --> 00:27:22,956 
We're all right with the tanks. 
It's all right, Captain. 

319 
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:24,332 
Captain Willard! 

320 
00:27:24,457 --> 00:27:27,836 
I carry priority papers from 
Com-Sec Intelligence, II Corps. 

321 
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:29,879 
I understand Nha Trang 
has briefed you... 

322 
00:27:30,004 --> 00:27:31,881 
on the requirements of my mission. 

323 
00:27:32,006 --> 00:27:34,551 
What mission? 
I haven't heard from Nha Trang. 

324 
00:27:34,676 --> 00:27:37,595 
Sir, your unit is supposed 
to escort us into the Nung! 

325 
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,889 
- We'll see what we can do. 
- Colonel! 

326 
00:27:40,014 --> 00:27:44,769 
But just stay out of my way 
until this is done, Captain. 

327 
00:27:47,188 --> 00:27:50,024 
All right, let's see what we have. 
Let's see what we have. 

328 
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:55,196 
A two of spades, three of spades, 
four of diamonds... 

329 
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:57,907 
six of clubs, eight of spades. 

330 
00:27:58,032 --> 00:28:01,077 
There isn't one worth a jack 
in the whole bunch. 

331 
00:28:01,202 --> 00:28:04,080 
Four of diamonds. 

332 
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:07,917 
- Hey, Captain, what's that? 
- Death cards! 

333 
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:11,337 
- What? 
- Death cards! 

334 
00:28:11,463 --> 00:28:13,798 
- Death? 
- Lets Charlie know who did this. 

335 
00:28:17,385 --> 00:28:20,180 
<i>- Cheer up, son. 
- We will not hurt or harm you. </i> 

336 
00:28:20,305 --> 00:28:24,017 
- Fire in the hole! 
- Fire in the hole! 

337 
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:27,771 
<i>This is an area 
that is controlled... </i> 

338 
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:30,273 
<i>by the Vietcong 
and North Vietnamese. </i> 

339 
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:32,317 
Jim. 

340 
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:39,616 
<i>We are here to help you. </i> 

341 
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:44,704 
<i>- We extend a welcome hand... 
- Come on.</i> 

342 
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:46,873 
<i>-to those who would like to return... 
- Everybody in?</i> 

343 
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:51,294 
<i>to the arms of 
the South Vietnamese government. </i> 

344 
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,839 
Get in. Hurry up. 

345 
00:28:55,924 --> 00:28:57,634 
Move it out. 

346 
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:00,261 
<i>This is an area 
that is controlled... </i> 

347 
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:02,972 
<i>by the Vietcong 
and North Vietnamese. </i> 

348 
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:08,228 
Hey! What's this? 
What is this? 

349 
00:29:08,353 --> 00:29:11,022 
This man's hurt 
pretty bad, sir. 

350 
00:29:11,147 --> 00:29:14,567 
About the only thing that's holding 
his guts in, sir, is that pot lid. 

351 
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:17,070 
Yeah? What do you have to say? 

352 
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:22,992 
This soldier is dirty VC. He wants 
water. He can drink paddy water. 

353 
00:29:23,118 --> 00:29:26,496 
Get outta here! 
Give me that canteen. 

354 
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:29,749 
- He's VC! 
- Any man that's brave enough to... 

355 
00:29:29,874 --> 00:29:32,460 
Get outta here! 
I'll kick your fuckin' ass! 

356 
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:34,671 
He killed a lot of our people! 

357 
00:29:34,796 --> 00:29:36,923 
Any man brave enough 
to fight with his guts... 

358 
00:29:37,006 --> 00:29:39,008 
strapped on him 
can drink from my canteen. 

359 
00:29:39,134 --> 00:29:43,179 
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those 
sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer. 

360 
00:29:43,304 --> 00:29:47,100 
- Where? Here? You sure? 
- Down there. 

361 
00:29:47,225 --> 00:29:49,185 
Yeah? Here. 

362 
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,230 
Repeat. We have a body count. 
We have... 

363 
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:56,943 
What's your name, sailor? 

364 
00:29:57,068 --> 00:29:59,904 
- Gunner's Mate Third Class Johnson. 
- Gunner's Mate Third Class... 

365 
00:29:59,988 --> 00:30:04,075 
- Lance Johnson, the surfer? 
- Yes, sir. 

366 
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,329 
It's an honor to meet you. I've 
admired your nose riding for years. 

367 
00:30:08,455 --> 00:30:11,291 
I like your cutback too. I think 
you have the best cutback there is. 

368 
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:14,043 
- Thank you, sir. 
- You can cut out the "sir" crap. 

369 
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:16,171 
I'm Bill Kilgore. 
I'm a goofy foot. 

370 
00:30:16,296 --> 00:30:18,173 
- This guy with ya? 
- Yeah. 

371 
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:20,091 
I want you to meet some guys. 

372 
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:22,093 
- This is Mike from San Diego. 
- Far out. 

373 
00:30:22,218 --> 00:30:25,054 
- Johnny from Malibu. Solid surfers. 
- John, hi. Far out. 

374 
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,307 
None of us are anywhere 
near your class though. 

375 
00:30:27,432 --> 00:30:28,850 
No way. 

376 
00:30:28,975 --> 00:30:32,854 
We do a lot of surfing around here. 
I like to finish operations early. 

377 
00:30:32,979 --> 00:30:35,315 
Fly down to Yung Tau 
for the evening glass. 

378 
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,859 
Been riding since you got here? 

379 
00:30:37,984 --> 00:30:40,570 
No way. I haven't surfed 
since I been here. 

380 
00:30:40,695 --> 00:30:43,072 
Through Christ, our Lord... 

381 
00:30:43,198 --> 00:30:45,241 
from Whom 
all good things come... 

382 
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:47,952 
through Him in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit. 

383 
00:30:48,036 --> 00:30:50,914 
All glory and honor 
is Yours, Almighty Father. 

384 
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,458 
Let us bring 
our iniquities to the Father... 

385 
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,502 
in the words our Savior gave us. 

386 
00:30:55,627 --> 00:31:00,548 
Our Father, Who art in heaven, 
hallowed be Thy name. 

387 
00:31:00,673 --> 00:31:05,303 
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done 
on earth as it is in heaven. 

388 
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:08,223 
Give us this day 
our daily bread... 

389 
00:31:08,348 --> 00:31:10,225 
and forgive us our trespasses... 

390 
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,435 
<i>as we forgive those 
who trespass against us. </i> 

391 
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,189 
<i>Lead us not into temptation, 
but deliver us from evil. </i> 

392 
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,993 
<i>Kilgore had had a pretty 
good day for himself. </i> 

393 
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,246 
<i>They choppered in 
the T-bones and the beer... </i> 

394 
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:34,624 
<i>and turned the LZ 
into a beach party. </i> 

395 
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:37,710 
<i>The more they tried 
to make it just like home... </i> 

396 
00:31:37,836 --> 00:31:40,463 
<i>the more they made 
everybody miss it. </i> 

397 
00:31:40,588 --> 00:31:43,758 
Make my meat rare... 
rare but not cold. 

398 
00:31:49,764 --> 00:31:52,976 
<i>Well, he wasn't 
a bad officer, I guess. </i> 

399 
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:56,604 
<i>He loved his boys, 
and you felt safe with him. </i> 

400 
00:31:56,729 --> 00:31:59,983 
<i>He was one of those guys that 
had that weird light around him. </i> 

401 
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:03,903 
<i>You just knew he wasn't gonna 
get so much as a scratch here. </i> 

402 
00:32:03,987 --> 00:32:07,866 
What happened to your mission? 
Nha Trang forget all about you? 

403 
00:32:15,915 --> 00:32:18,960 
Airborne. 

404 
00:32:19,085 --> 00:32:22,547 
Sir, two places we can 
get into the river. 

405 
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:25,675 
- Yeah. 
- Here and here. 

406 
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,638 
It's a pretty wide delta, but these 
are the only two spots I'm sure of. 

407 
00:32:30,764 --> 00:32:33,767 
That village you're pointing at 
is kind of hairy. 

408 
00:32:33,892 --> 00:32:36,186 
- What do you mean "hairy," sir? 
- It's hairy. 

409 
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:38,188 
Got some pretty heavy ordnance. 

410 
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:40,690 
I lost a few recon ships 
in there now and again. 

411 
00:32:40,815 --> 00:32:44,027 
What's the name of 
that goddam village? Vin Drin... 

412 
00:32:44,152 --> 00:32:46,488 
- Dop. 
- Dop or Lop? 

413 
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:50,200 
Damn gook names 
all sound the same. 

414 
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:53,328 
Mike, you know anything about 
this point at Vin Drin Dop? 

415 
00:32:53,453 --> 00:32:55,330 
That's a fantastic peak. 

416 
00:32:55,455 --> 00:32:57,874 
- Peak? 
- About six foot. 

417 
00:32:57,999 --> 00:33:01,669 
It's an outstanding peak. It's got 
both the long right and left slide... 

418 
00:33:01,795 --> 00:33:03,963 
with a bowl section 
that's unbelievable. 

419 
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:06,466 
It's just tube city. 

420 
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,721 
Why didn't you tell me 
that before? A good peak. 

421 
00:33:11,846 --> 00:33:14,516 
There aren't any good peaks 
in this whole shitty country. 

422 
00:33:14,641 --> 00:33:16,518 
It's all goddam beach break. 

423 
00:33:16,643 --> 00:33:19,562 
It's really hairy in there. 
That's where we lost McDonald. 

424 
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:23,900 
They shot the hell out of us there. 
That's Charlie's point. 

425 
00:33:24,025 --> 00:33:26,402 
Sir, we can go in there 
tomorrow at dawn. 

426 
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,571 
There's always a good 
offshore breeze in the morning. 

427 
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:30,573 
We may not be able 
to get the boat in. 

428 
00:33:30,698 --> 00:33:34,702 
The draught at the mouth of 
that river may be too shallow. 

429 
00:33:34,828 --> 00:33:37,747 
We'll pick your boat up and put it 
down like a baby where you want it. 

430 
00:33:37,872 --> 00:33:40,375 
This is the First of the Ninth, 
Air-Cav, son. 

431 
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,796 
Air mobile! I can take that point 
and hold it as long as I like. 

432 
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:47,966 
You can get anyplace up that river 
that suits you, young Captain. 

433 
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:50,468 
Hell, a six-foot peak. 

434 
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:53,596 
Take a gunship 
back to the division. 

435 
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:55,765 
Lance, go with Mike and let him 
pick out a board for you. 

436 
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,059 
Bring me my Yater Spoon, 
the eight-six. 

437 
00:33:58,184 --> 00:34:00,061 
- I don't know, sir... 
- What is it, soldier? 

438 
00:34:00,186 --> 00:34:03,231 
It's hairy in there. 
It's Charlie's point. 

439 
00:34:03,356 --> 00:34:05,442 
Charlie don't surf! 

440 
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:32,552 
Hey, Jesus, Clean, you ain't 
gonna believe this. Look. 

441 
00:34:33,678 --> 00:34:36,556 
Hey, man! 
They're pickin' up the boat! 

442 
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:43,688 
- How are you feeling, Jimmy? 
- Like a mean motherfucker, sir! 

443 
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:47,275 
All right, son, let 'er rip. 

444 
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,153 
Let's go! 

445 
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:16,364 
I never have got used to a light 
board. I can't get used to one. 

446 
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:19,367 
- I'm used to a heavy board. 
- I know, it's a real drag. 

447 
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:22,078 
- You prefer a heavy or light board? 
- Heavier. 

448 
00:36:22,203 --> 00:36:24,080 
- Really? 
- Yeah! 

449 
00:36:24,205 --> 00:36:26,875 
I thought all the young guys 
like lighter boards. 

450 
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,086 
<i>- You can't ride the nose on those. 
- Big Duke Six. </i> 

451 
00:36:30,211 --> 00:36:31,838 
This is Eagle Thrust Seven. 
We've got it spotted. 

452 
00:36:31,963 --> 00:36:33,506 
<i>Duke Six to Eagle Thrust. </i> 

453 
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:37,051 
Put on heading two-seven-zero. 
Assume attack formation. 

454 
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:39,512 
<i>That's a roger, Big Duke. 
We're going in. </i> 

455 
00:36:39,637 --> 00:36:43,683 
Hey, Lance, we'll come in 
low out of the rising sun. 

456 
00:36:43,808 --> 00:36:46,269 
About a mile out, 
we'll put on the music. 

457 
00:36:46,394 --> 00:36:48,730 
- Music? 
- Yeah, I use Wagner. 

458 
00:36:48,855 --> 00:36:52,942 
Scares the hell out of the slopes. 
My boys love it. 

459 
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:55,403 
Hey, they're gonna play music! 

460 
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,622 
How come all you guys 
sit on your helmet? 

461 
00:37:05,747 --> 00:37:09,042 
So we don't get 
our balls blown off. 

462 
00:37:19,094 --> 00:37:23,473 
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust. 
Put on psy war op. 

463 
00:37:23,598 --> 00:37:28,269 
Make it loud. This is a Romeo 
Fox Trot. Shall we dance? 

464 
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:35,777 
Yes, sir! 

465 
00:39:53,665 --> 00:39:56,918 
- Come on! 
- All right. Fire. 

466 
00:40:06,344 --> 00:40:09,431 
<i>We got a couple... 
at that tree line. </i> 

467 
00:40:09,556 --> 00:40:12,475 
<i>We're taking fire from the holes. </i> 

468 
00:40:13,768 --> 00:40:15,895 
Run, Charlie! 

469 
00:40:18,231 --> 00:40:22,152 
<i>This should make 
everything burn. </i> 

470 
00:40:31,953 --> 00:40:35,165 
<i>We got a couple 
of people ahead here. </i> 

471 
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:38,668 
<i>-What's going down here? 
-We got an automatic! Shoot to kill! </i> 

472 
00:40:38,793 --> 00:40:42,338 
<i>-Shoot to kill in the open! 
-I spotted a large weapon down below. </i> 

473 
00:40:42,464 --> 00:40:44,841 
We're gonna go down 
and check it out. 

474 
00:40:44,966 --> 00:40:47,302 
<i>All right, this is Fox Trot. 
We're pullin' in. </i> 

475 
00:40:56,978 --> 00:40:58,772 
What a shot. 

476 
00:40:58,897 --> 00:41:01,691 
Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding. 
Get you a case of beer for that. 

477 
00:41:23,505 --> 00:41:26,049 
<i>Six-four-one-zero, 
we're over the village right now. </i> 

478 
00:41:26,174 --> 00:41:29,010 
I see a vehicle in the courtyard. 
I'm gonna check it out. 

479 
00:41:29,135 --> 00:41:31,429 
Well done, Hawks. 

480 
00:41:31,554 --> 00:41:34,182 
Want some twenty-Mike-Mike-Vulcan 
along those tree lines. 

481 
00:41:34,307 --> 00:41:36,226 
Ripple the shit out of 'em. 

482 
00:41:36,351 --> 00:41:38,937 
Got a vehicle on the bridge, 
50 caliber on board. 

483 
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,148 
He's moving across 
to resupply the weapon. 

484 
00:41:42,273 --> 00:41:45,485 
<i>Big Duke Six, clear the area. 
I'm coming down myself. </i> 

485 
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,403 
Don't these people ever give up? 

486 
00:41:50,198 --> 00:41:53,243 
Nice shot, Bill. 

487 
00:41:53,368 --> 00:41:56,996 
- Shit! 
- All right, all right! 

488 
00:41:57,122 --> 00:42:01,543 
- It's just a flare! 
- It's a flare! Gotta get outta here! 

489 
00:42:01,668 --> 00:42:03,878 
Un-ass that shit. 
Get it outta here! 

490 
00:42:04,003 --> 00:42:08,007 
Get it out. It's just a flare. 
It's all right. 

491 
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:11,261 
- Everybody all right? Lance? 
- I'm fine! 

492 
00:42:26,317 --> 00:42:28,194 
Get down! 

493 
00:42:46,588 --> 00:42:51,885 
I'm not going! 
I'm not going! I'm not going. 

494 
00:43:07,108 --> 00:43:09,194 
<i>We just got a secondary 
down there in the plaza. </i> 

495 
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:11,404 
<i>Hold on to your position. </i> 

496 
00:43:11,529 --> 00:43:14,657 
<i>Duke Six, we've got 
wounded down there. </i> 

497 
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:26,086 
- Get a stretcher over here! 
- You're all right. 

498 
00:43:30,757 --> 00:43:35,762 
- Please, God! Help me! 
- Give him some morphine. 

499 
00:43:35,887 --> 00:43:38,181 
My God! Oh! 

500 
00:43:38,306 --> 00:43:41,518 
- Seven-four-two! 
- Where's that duster? 

501 
00:43:41,643 --> 00:43:44,312 
I want my wounded out of there 
and in the hospital in 15 minutes. 

502 
00:43:44,437 --> 00:43:46,356 
I want my men out. 

503 
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:48,566 
<i>Somebody stay in there 
tight with Big Duke. </i> 

504 
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:52,946 
<i>This is Ten-Ten. We're gonna be in, 
throw 'em on and get out. </i> 

505 
00:44:12,757 --> 00:44:15,218 
She's got a grenade! 

506 
00:44:15,343 --> 00:44:16,803 
She's got a grenade! 

507 
00:44:20,014 --> 00:44:21,724 
The whole thing blew up. 

508 
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,643 
<i>- She blew the shit... 
- Fucking savages.</i> 

509 
00:44:26,229 --> 00:44:28,231 
<i>- Get a medevac. 
- Holy Christ, she's a SAP.</i> 

510 
00:44:28,356 --> 00:44:30,024 
<i>I'm gonna get 
that dink bitch. </i> 

511 
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:33,403 
<i>Get over there, Johnny. Roll 
that right skid right up her ass. </i> 

512 
00:44:36,197 --> 00:44:37,407 
We gotta get some air 
in these trees. 

513 
00:44:37,532 --> 00:44:39,868 
It's goddam eat-up 
with enemy down here. 

514 
00:44:39,993 --> 00:44:42,036 
<i>I'm taking fire. 
I'm taking hits all over. </i> 

515 
00:44:42,162 --> 00:44:44,414 
Three o'clock! 
I'm drawing heavy fire! 

516 
00:44:44,539 --> 00:44:46,916 
<i>I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday! 
I'm goin' in. </i> 

517 
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,501 
<i>My tail rotor's out. 
I got control. </i> 

518 
00:44:57,343 --> 00:45:00,305 
- What do you think? 
- Wow! This is really exciting, man. 

519 
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:03,641 
- No! No! The waves! The waves! 
- Oh, right. 

520 
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:07,437 
Look at that. 
Breaks both ways. Watch. Watch. 

521 
00:45:07,562 --> 00:45:10,482 
<i>Look! Good six-foot swells! </i> 

522 
00:45:33,546 --> 00:45:35,423 
Come here, Lance. 

523 
00:45:39,094 --> 00:45:40,970 
Incoming! 

524 
00:45:43,598 --> 00:45:45,642 
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir. 

525 
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:47,685 
Maybe you ought to surf 
somewhere else. 

526 
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:49,187 
What do you know 
about surfing, Major? 

527 
00:45:49,312 --> 00:45:52,023 
You're from goddam New Jersey. 

528 
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:56,402 
Come here! Come here! 

529 
00:45:58,613 --> 00:46:01,116 
- Change! 
- You mean right now, sir? 

530 
00:46:01,241 --> 00:46:04,035 
I wanna see how rideable 
that stuff is. Go change. 

531 
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,037 
It's still pretty hairy 
out there. 

532 
00:46:06,162 --> 00:46:08,123 
- Do you wanna surf, soldier? 
- Yes, sir. 

533 
00:46:08,248 --> 00:46:10,750 
That's good, son, 
'cause you either surf or fight. 

534 
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:14,587 
That clear? Get going. 
I'll cover for 'em. 

535 
00:46:14,712 --> 00:46:17,757 
And bring a board for Lance. 

536 
00:46:17,882 --> 00:46:20,176 
We can't do shit 
until the boat gets here. 

537 
00:46:20,301 --> 00:46:23,638 
Lance, I'll bet you can't 
wait to get out there. 

538 
00:46:23,763 --> 00:46:25,682 
- What? 
- See how they break both ways? 

539 
00:46:25,807 --> 00:46:29,769 
One guy can break right, one left, 
simultaneous. What do you think? 

540 
00:46:29,894 --> 00:46:31,938 
We ought to wait 
for the tide to come up. 

541 
00:46:32,021 --> 00:46:35,024 
- Come here. Look. 
- Incoming! 

542 
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:42,031 
The tide doesn't come in 
for six hours! 

543 
00:46:42,157 --> 00:46:45,243 
You wanna wait here 
for six hours? 

544 
00:46:47,287 --> 00:46:51,166 
Yo! Chief! Chief! 

545 
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,384 
<i>Okay, fellas, quit hiding. 
Come on! Let's go! </i> 

546 
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:04,220 
<i>- Dick-heads, take off! 
- Goddam it!</i> 

547 
00:47:04,345 --> 00:47:06,848 
Don't you think it's 
a little risky for R and R? 

548 
00:47:06,973 --> 00:47:11,019 
If I say it's safe to surf this 
beach, it's safe to surf this beach! 

549 
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:13,396 
I'm not afraid 
to surf this place! 

550 
00:47:13,521 --> 00:47:16,399 
I'll surf this fuckin' place. 

551 
00:47:18,401 --> 00:47:20,862 
Give me that R-T, soldier. 

552 
00:47:22,155 --> 00:47:25,241 
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six. 
Goddam it! 

553 
00:47:25,366 --> 00:47:27,452 
<i>I want that tree line bombed! </i> 

554 
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:30,038 
<i>Big Duke Six, roger. 
Dove One-Three, stand by. </i> 

555 
00:47:30,163 --> 00:47:32,040 
<i>Blow them into the Stone Age, son! </i> 

556 
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:35,251 
- Out! 
- No, back, no! 

557 
00:47:35,376 --> 00:47:39,047 
Let me take care of this. 
Get that out of here! 

558 
00:47:39,172 --> 00:47:42,634 
- I'm sorry. 
- Come here now. All right. 

559 
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:44,844 
- No, ma'am. Sorry! 
- Jimmy! 

560 
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:46,930 
<i>Hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three. </i> 

561 
00:47:47,055 --> 00:47:50,475 
<i>They need some napalm in the tree 
line. Can you put it down there? </i> 

562 
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,561 
<i>Right, One-Three. We're fixin' 
to fuck with 'em. What's the target? </i> 

563 
00:47:53,686 --> 00:47:56,898 
<i>We're trying to suppress some mortar 
fire off the tree line down there. </i> 

564 
00:47:57,023 --> 00:47:59,150 
<i>- Roger. Here we come. 
- Good. Give it all you got. </i> 

565 
00:47:59,275 --> 00:48:01,778 
<i>Bring in all your ships. </i> 

566 
00:48:01,903 --> 00:48:05,657 
Put him in my chopper. 
Get him back to the hospital. 

567 
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,992 
No, no, no, 
you got to go with him. 

568 
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:10,954 
Come on! Go! Go! 
Get it outta here! 

569 
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:12,956 
Tell my guys I want my board! 

570 
00:48:13,081 --> 00:48:14,958 
<i>Big Duke Six, 
this is Dove One-Three. </i> 

571 
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:18,461 
<i>The jets are inbound now. You got 
about 30 seconds to bomb station. </i> 

572 
00:48:18,586 --> 00:48:21,673 
<i>Get your people back and heads down. 
This is gonna be a big one. </i> 

573 
00:48:23,091 --> 00:48:25,135 
Don't worry. 

574 
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,389 
We'll have this place cleaned up 
in a jiffy, son. Don't you worry. 

575 
00:48:29,514 --> 00:48:32,934 
Give me those shorts. 

576 
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:36,771 
These are from the Air-Cav, 
a present from me and the boys. 

577 
00:48:36,896 --> 00:48:40,191 
I want to see you do your stuff 
in 'em out there. 

578 
00:49:03,631 --> 00:49:05,759 
You smell that? 

579 
00:49:05,884 --> 00:49:08,470 
- Do you smell that? 
- What? 

580 
00:49:08,595 --> 00:49:13,683 
Napalm, son. Nothing else 
in the world smells like that. 

581 
00:49:13,808 --> 00:49:17,562 
Come on. Move it! 
Move it! Move it! 

582 
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:20,523 
I love the smell of napalm 
in the morning. 

583 
00:49:20,648 --> 00:49:23,276 
You know, one time we had 
a hill bombed for 12 hours. 

584 
00:49:23,401 --> 00:49:26,696 
When it was all over, 
I walked up. 

585 
00:49:26,821 --> 00:49:32,118 
We didn't find one of them, 
not one stinking dink body. 

586 
00:49:32,243 --> 00:49:35,288 
But the smell... 
You know, that gasoline smell. 

587 
00:49:35,413 --> 00:49:39,667 
The whole hill smelled like... 

588 
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:44,923 
victory. 

589 
00:49:49,177 --> 00:49:52,097 
Someday this war's gonna end. 

590 
00:50:06,027 --> 00:50:08,571 
- Lance! The wind! 
- Huh? 

591 
00:50:08,696 --> 00:50:10,615 
- The wind! 
- What? 

592 
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,785 
It's blowin' onshore! 
It's gonna blow this place out. 

593 
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:17,038 
- It's gonna ruin it! 
- Not cool! It's gonna blow out! 

594 
00:50:17,163 --> 00:50:20,083 
It's the goddam napalm! 
That's what's doin' it! 

595 
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:23,086 
I know. I'm really sorry, Colonel. 
I'm afraid that does it. 

596 
00:50:23,211 --> 00:50:24,421 
The kid's got a reputation. 

597 
00:50:24,546 --> 00:50:26,923 
You can't expect him 
to surf those sloppy waves. 

598 
00:50:27,048 --> 00:50:29,259 
- I understand. 
- I'm an artist, Bill. 

599 
00:50:29,384 --> 00:50:34,389 
- I couldn't surf that stuff. 
- I apologize. It's not my fault. 

600 
00:50:34,514 --> 00:50:35,974 
The waves are gettin' 
blown out by the napalm. 

601 
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,142 
Don't get me wrong... 

602 
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:39,269 
It was the bombs causing 
a vortex with the wind. 

603 
00:50:39,394 --> 00:50:41,271 
I accept your apology. 

604 
00:50:41,396 --> 00:50:44,065 
But if you could hang 
around 20 minutes... 

605 
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:46,484 
- Some other time, Bill. 
- Just 20 minutes! 

606 
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:49,821 
- I'm an artist. 
- Keep walking. 

607 
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:53,950 
<i>Okay, give it a try, guys. 
One goes left and one goes right. </i> 

608 
00:50:54,075 --> 00:50:55,952 
<i>Look, Lance. </i> 

609 
00:50:56,077 --> 00:50:57,954 
- You through surfing? 
- Yeah! 

610 
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,956 
- Wanna say good-bye to the colonel? 
- No. 

611 
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:01,958 
- You sure? 
- Yeah! 

612 
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:04,419 
<i>- Get the fuck outta here. 
- It's the napalm. </i> 

613 
00:51:04,544 --> 00:51:06,796 
<i>Just wait 20 minutes! </i> 

614 
00:51:06,921 --> 00:51:09,048 
Damn! Fuck! 

615 
00:51:09,174 --> 00:51:12,010 
They've been lookin' for ya. 

616 
00:51:13,386 --> 00:51:16,306 
- Don't leave without me! 
- Where the fuck you goin'? 

617 
00:51:16,431 --> 00:51:19,100 
Here! 

618 
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,480 
Incoming! 

619 
00:51:23,605 --> 00:51:25,523 
That's the colonel's surfboard! 

620 
00:51:25,648 --> 00:51:27,984 
Hey, get the fuck off me! 
It's mine! 

621 
00:51:36,284 --> 00:51:38,828 
You fucking Airborne! 

622 
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:12,362 
- Lance. 
- Chef, light up, man. 

623 
00:52:12,487 --> 00:52:14,030 
Come on. Let's get high. 

624 
00:52:14,155 --> 00:52:16,116 
- Wanna smoke? 
- Let's do it, man. Light up. 

625 
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:19,661 
<i>Someday this war's gonna end. </i> 

626 
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:22,664 
<i>That would be just fine 
with the boys on the boat. </i> 

627 
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:25,083 
<i>They weren't looking for 
anything more than a way home. </i> 

628 
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:30,171 
<i>- Captain? 
- Trouble is, I'd been back there... </i> 

629 
00:52:30,296 --> 00:52:33,341 
<i>and I knew that it just 
didn't exist any more. </i> 

630 
00:52:35,802 --> 00:52:38,805 
Buddha time. Here. 

631 
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:43,059 
All right, that's great, 
you motherfuckers. Yeah. 

632 
00:52:47,105 --> 00:52:50,233 
<i>If that's how Kilgore 
fought the war... </i> 

633 
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:54,237 
<i>I began to wonder what 
they really had against Kurtz. </i> 

634 
00:52:54,362 --> 00:52:57,240 
<i>It wasn't just 
insanity and murder. </i> 

635 
00:52:57,365 --> 00:53:00,410 
<i>There was enough of that 
to go around for everyone. </i> 

636 
00:53:11,212 --> 00:53:14,299 
I mean, he never 
was hurtin' for pussy. 

637 
00:53:14,674 --> 00:53:19,304 
I'm not here. I'm walking through 
the jungle gathering mangos. 

638 
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:22,348 
I meet Raquel Welch. 

639 
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:29,105 
I make a nice 
mango cream pudding. 

640 
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:32,442 
You know, kind of 
spread it around on us. 

641 
00:53:32,567 --> 00:53:36,279 
She's into mangos too. 

642 
00:53:36,404 --> 00:53:38,907 
She's like one limb above me. 

643 
00:53:39,032 --> 00:53:42,452 
- We're both in the jungle here nude. 
- Hey, Chief. 

644 
00:53:42,577 --> 00:53:45,747 
- Yeah? 
- Here comes that colonel guy again. 

645 
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:51,628 
<i>You know how hard it is 
to find a board you like. </i> 

646 
00:53:51,753 --> 00:53:54,130 
<i>I will not hurt or harm you. </i> 

647 
00:53:54,255 --> 00:53:56,466 
<i>I will not hurt 
or harm you. </i> 

648 
00:53:56,591 --> 00:53:59,469 
<i>Just give me back 
the board, Lance. </i> 

649 
00:53:59,594 --> 00:54:02,889 
<i>It was a good board, 
and I like it. </i> 

650 
00:54:02,972 --> 00:54:06,434 
<i>You know how hard it is 
to find a board you like. </i> 

651 
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,355 
<i>- He's a determined motherfucker! 
- I will not hurt or harm you. </i> 

652 
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,899 
<i>I will not hurt or harm you. </i> 

653 
00:54:12,982 --> 00:54:15,777 
<i>Just give me back 
the board, Lance. </i> 

654 
00:54:15,902 --> 00:54:18,154 
<i>It was a good board, 
and I like it. </i> 

655 
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:22,951 
<i>You know how hard it is 
to find a board you like. </i> 

656 
00:54:23,076 --> 00:54:25,995 
<i>- I will not hurt or harm you. 
- Jesus Christ.</i> 

657 
00:54:26,121 --> 00:54:28,706 
That guy's too 
fuckin' much, man. 

658 
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,792 
Do you think 
he would have shot us? 

659 
00:54:30,917 --> 00:54:33,169 
He wouldn't have shot us 
on the beach... 

660 
00:54:33,294 --> 00:54:36,047 
but he would have shot us 
if he saw me taking his board. 

661 
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:38,341 
<i>Let's go surfin' now 
Everybody's learnin' how</i> 

662 
00:54:38,466 --> 00:54:40,844 
Let's get this board 
out of my turret. 

663 
00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:42,178 
Sucker. 

664 
00:54:42,303 --> 00:54:44,722 
How am I going to shoot him 
the next time he comes around? 

665 
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:49,269 
Hey, Chef, make some room 
back there for the board. 

666 
00:54:51,271 --> 00:54:53,690 
Sock it to me, Lance. 

667 
00:54:57,986 --> 00:55:00,321 
I wonder if that's 
the same chopper. 

668 
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:03,616 
He's probably got them all over 
the river with that recording. 

669 
00:55:03,741 --> 00:55:05,618 
We'll have to hold up here 
till dark, Chief. 

670 
00:55:05,743 --> 00:55:07,787 
Don't worry, Lance. 
He won't follow us too far. 

671 
00:55:07,912 --> 00:55:09,622 
What makes you say that? 

672 
00:55:09,748 --> 00:55:11,624 
You think that big Cav colonel 
wants everyone upriver... 

673 
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,209 
to know we stole his board? 

674 
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:15,378 
I didn't steal it! 

675 
00:55:17,505 --> 00:55:19,382 
- Captain? 
- Hmm? 

676 
00:55:19,507 --> 00:55:22,594 
Just how far up 
this river we goin'? 

677 
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:27,515 
It's classified, Chief. 
I can't tell ya. 

678 
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,642 
We're goin' up pretty far. 

679 
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:32,979 
Is it gonna be hairy? 

680 
00:55:34,689 --> 00:55:38,860 
I don't know, kid. 
Yeah, probably. 

681 
00:55:38,985 --> 00:55:42,739 
You like it like that, Captain, 
when it's hot, hairy? 

682 
00:55:42,864 --> 00:55:45,158 
Fuck. 

683 
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,836 
Maybe you'll get 
a chance to know... 

684 
00:55:56,961 --> 00:55:59,339 
what the fuck you are 
in some factory in Ohio. 

685 
00:56:00,673 --> 00:56:04,427 
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go 
get those mangos now, okay? 

686 
00:56:04,552 --> 00:56:06,596 
- Take somebody with ya. 
- Yeah, I'll take... 

687 
00:56:06,721 --> 00:56:08,932 
I'll go with him. 

688 
00:56:13,561 --> 00:56:15,772 
Chef? 

689 
00:56:15,897 --> 00:56:18,775 
- Yes, sir? 
- How come they call you that? 

690 
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,319 
- Call me what, sir? 
- Chef. 

691 
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:25,573 
- Because you like mangos and stuff? 
- No, sir, I'm a real chef. 

692 
00:56:25,698 --> 00:56:29,786 
- I'm a saucier. 
- Saucier? 

693 
00:56:29,911 --> 00:56:33,832 
Yes, sir. 
See, I come from New Orleans. 

694 
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:38,378 
I was raised to be a saucier, 
a great saucier. 

695 
00:56:38,503 --> 00:56:41,714 
- What's a saucier? 
- You specialize in sauces. 

696 
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,264 
Gotta be a mango tree 
here somewhere. 

697 
00:56:54,936 --> 00:56:57,730 
Then, I was supposed 
to go to Paris... 

698 
00:56:57,856 --> 00:57:00,650 
study at the Escoffier school. 

699 
00:57:00,775 --> 00:57:05,905 
But then I got orders 
for my physical. 

700 
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:18,626 
Hell, I joined the navy. 

701 
00:57:18,752 --> 00:57:21,337 
Heard they had better food. 

702 
00:57:21,463 --> 00:57:23,882 
Cook school... that did it. 

703 
00:57:23,965 --> 00:57:28,928 
- Yeah, how's that? 
- You don't wanna hear about that. 

704 
00:57:30,472 --> 00:57:34,684 
They lined us up in front 
of a hundred yards of prime rib. 

705 
00:57:34,809 --> 00:57:37,979 
All of us, you know, 
lined up lookin' at it. 

706 
00:57:38,104 --> 00:57:41,900 
Magnificent meat. Really! 
Beautifully marbled. 

707 
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:48,907 
Next thing, they're throwing 
the meat into these big cauldrons... 

708 
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:51,993 
all of it... boiling it! 

709 
00:57:52,118 --> 00:57:56,039 
I looked inside, man. 
It was turning grey. 

710 
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:59,084 
I couldn't fucking 
believe that one. 

711 
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:04,964 
That's when I applied for radioman 
school, but then they gave me... 

712 
00:58:43,795 --> 00:58:46,423 
What is it? 

713 
00:58:47,549 --> 00:58:49,426 
Charlie? 

714 
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:01,980 
It's a tiger! 

715 
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:07,193 
Son of a bitch! 
It's a tiger, man! It's a tiger! 

716 
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:09,821 
Battle stations. 
Lance, up front. 

717 
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:11,197 
- Get on your 60! 
- Got it. 

718 
00:59:11,322 --> 00:59:16,035 
- Holy shit! A fuckin' tiger! 
- Chef, come on! 

719 
00:59:16,161 --> 00:59:19,205 
- Captain, come on! 
- Let's hop in and go! 

720 
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,499 
Let's go! 

721 
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:24,169 
You were right. 
Never get out of the boat. 

722 
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,963 
- Bring that 60 forward! 
- Why never get out of the boat? 

723 
00:59:27,088 --> 00:59:30,508 
I gotta remember! 
Never get out of the boat! 

724 
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:32,802 
Never get out of the boat! 

725 
00:59:34,929 --> 00:59:37,932 
- How many is it? 
- A fuckin' tiger! 

726 
00:59:38,016 --> 00:59:40,560 
- What? 
- A tiger? 

727 
00:59:40,685 --> 00:59:46,107 
Yes! I've had it! I've had 
the whole goddam fuckin' shit, man! 

728 
00:59:46,232 --> 00:59:48,818 
You can kiss my ass 
on the county square... 

729 
00:59:48,943 --> 00:59:50,862 
because I'm fuckin' buggin' out. 

730 
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:52,864 
I didn't come here for this. 

731 
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:55,617 
I don't fuckin' need it! 
I don't want it. 

732 
00:59:55,742 --> 01:00:00,121 
I didn't get out the goddam 
eighth grade for this kind of shit! 

733 
01:00:00,246 --> 01:00:02,499 
All I wanted to do 
was fuckin' cook! 

734 
01:00:02,624 --> 01:00:05,794 
I just wanted to learn 
to fuckin' cook, man! 

735 
01:00:05,919 --> 01:00:08,797 
- You're all right. 
- What happened, bro? 

736 
01:00:10,924 --> 01:00:13,259 
You're all right. 
You're gonna be all right. 

737 
01:00:13,384 --> 01:00:16,971 
All right? 
It's gonna be all right? 

738 
01:00:17,097 --> 01:00:20,558 
Never get out 
of the fuckin' boat. 

739 
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:24,145 
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! 
Goodbye! 

740 
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:28,233 
<i>Never get out of the boat. </i> 

741 
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:31,069 
<i>Absolutely goddam right... </i> 

742 
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,989 
<i>unless you were 
going all the way. </i> 

743 
01:00:39,786 --> 01:00:42,163 
<i>Kurtz got off the boat. </i> 

744 
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:47,252 
<i>He split from 
the whole fuckin' programme. </i> 

745 
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:51,631 
<i>How did that happen? </i> 

746 
01:00:51,756 --> 01:00:54,759 
<i>What did he see here 
that first tour? </i> 

747 
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:04,561 
<i>Thirty-eight fucking years old. </i> 

748 
01:01:04,686 --> 01:01:06,604 
<i>If you joined 
the Green Berets... </i> 

749 
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:09,607 
<i>there was no way 
you'd ever get above colonel. </i> 

750 
01:01:09,732 --> 01:01:13,778 
<i>Kurtz knew what 
he was giving up. </i> 

751 
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:16,781 
<i>The more I read 
and began to understand... </i> 

752 
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:19,451 
<i>the more I admired him. </i> 

753 
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:22,245 
<i>His family and friends 
couldn't understand it... </i> 

754 
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:25,999 
<i>and they couldn't 
talk him out of it. </i> 

755 
01:01:26,124 --> 01:01:29,586 
<i>He had to apply three times, 
and he put up with a ton of shit. </i> 

756 
01:01:29,711 --> 01:01:32,964 
<i>But when he threatened 
to resign, they gave it to him. </i> 

757 
01:01:36,968 --> 01:01:41,431 
<i>The next youngest guy 
in his class was half his age. </i> 

758 
01:01:41,556 --> 01:01:44,142 
<i>They must have thought 
he was some far-out old man... </i> 

759 
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:46,644 
<i>humping it over that course. </i> 

760 
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:51,357 
<i>I did it when I was 19. 
It damn near wasted me. </i> 

761 
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:55,320 
<i>A tough motherfucker. </i> 

762 
01:01:56,654 --> 01:01:58,573 
<i>He finished it. </i> 

763 
01:02:00,617 --> 01:02:04,162 
<i>He could have gone for general... </i> 

764 
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:07,165 
<i>but he went for himself instead. </i> 

765 
01:02:09,626 --> 01:02:11,503 
Dear Eva... 

766 
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:14,339 
Today was really a new one. 

767 
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:19,302 
Almost got eaten alive 
by a fuckin' tiger. 

768 
01:02:19,427 --> 01:02:21,930 
Really un-fucking believable, 
you know? 

769 
01:02:22,055 --> 01:02:25,016 
We're taking this guy, 
Captain Willard, up the river... 

770 
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:28,186 
but he hasn't told us yet 
where we're taking him. 

771 
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,188 
<i>Come on, baby</i> 

772 
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,690 
Thought you might have 
heard by now from Elwood. 

773 
01:02:32,816 --> 01:02:36,569 
<i>October 1967. 
On special assignment... </i> 

774 
01:02:36,694 --> 01:02:38,863 
<i>Kontoom Province, II Corps. </i> 

775 
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:42,992 
<i>Kurtz staged Operation Archangel 
with combined local forces. </i> 

776 
01:02:43,118 --> 01:02:45,495 
<i>Rated a major success. </i> 

777 
01:02:48,623 --> 01:02:51,167 
<i>He received 
no official clearance. </i> 

778 
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:55,004 
<i>He just thought it up 
and did it. </i> 

779 
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:58,383 
<i>What balls. </i> 

780 
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:01,719 
<i>They were gonna nail his ass 
to the floorboards for that one. </i> 

781 
01:03:01,845 --> 01:03:04,431 
<i>But after the press 
got a hold of it... </i> 

782 
01:03:04,556 --> 01:03:06,724 
<i>they promoted him 
to full colonel instead. </i> 

783 
01:03:08,268 --> 01:03:13,022 
<i>Oh, man, the bullshit 
piled up so fast in Vietnam. </i> 

784 
01:03:13,148 --> 01:03:17,694 
<i>You needed wings 
to stay above it. </i> 

785 
01:03:43,595 --> 01:03:47,515 
This sure enough is a bizarre sight 
in the middle of this shit. 

786 
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:51,686 
Expecting us this time? 

787 
01:03:51,811 --> 01:03:53,730 
Damned if I know. 

788 
01:03:58,985 --> 01:04:00,904 
<i>Hello. Hello. </i> 

789 
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:03,156 
Jesus... 

790 
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:09,329 
Wow. 

791 
01:04:09,454 --> 01:04:13,666 
- It goes back up into the truck. 
- What? 

792 
01:04:13,792 --> 01:04:16,503 
We gotta get 
all that stuff up. 

793 
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,718 
Hau Phat. You ever been 
up here before, Chef? 

794 
01:04:23,843 --> 01:04:25,720 
I bet you we can score up here. 

795 
01:04:25,845 --> 01:04:28,681 
Check out the bikes, Lance. 

796 
01:04:28,807 --> 01:04:31,726 
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah! 

797 
01:04:31,851 --> 01:04:35,105 
- That's a good one. 
- Yeah, Sukiyaki. 

798 
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:37,482 
Yeah, man. 
This is something. 

799 
01:04:40,527 --> 01:04:42,445 
- Please! 
- This must be the guy. 

800 
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:44,906 
Right over there. 

801 
01:04:45,031 --> 01:04:47,367 
Sergeant. Sergeant. 

802 
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:55,792 
Three drums of diesel fuel, 
PBR five... 

803 
01:04:55,917 --> 01:04:57,710 
Come on, man! Move! 

804 
01:04:57,836 --> 01:04:59,963 
We don't have time. One hour. 
That's all. What do you want? 

805 
01:05:00,088 --> 01:05:03,383 
- Can I get some Panama Red? 
- Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red. 

806 
01:05:03,508 --> 01:05:06,845 
- Sergeant? 
- Destination? 

807 
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:08,346 
I don't have no destination. 

808 
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:10,682 
I can't do a goddam thing 
without a destination. 

809 
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:14,269 
- Sarge? Sarge? 
- I need a destination! 

810 
01:05:14,394 --> 01:05:16,396 
I can't do a thing about it 
with a destination. 

811 
01:05:16,521 --> 01:05:19,274 
These guys are with me. 
Destination's classified. 

812 
01:05:19,399 --> 01:05:21,734 
I carry priority papers 
from Com-Sec Intelligence. 

813 
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:25,488 
Okay, right, sir. Hey, listen, 
it's a real big night. 

814 
01:05:25,613 --> 01:05:28,658 
Eight bucks for that... 
Hey! 

815 
01:05:28,783 --> 01:05:31,035 
All right. Damn. 

816 
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:34,622 
- Just give him some fuel. 
- You got it. 

817 
01:05:34,748 --> 01:05:37,709 
- Dog starts barking. 
- Hey, listen, Captain. 

818 
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:40,879 
I'm really sorry about tonight. 
It's really bad around here. 

819 
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:45,675 
Just take this over to the man 
at the supply desk and you got it. 

820 
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,970 
Would you guys like some seats... 
some press box seats for the show? 

821 
01:05:49,095 --> 01:05:51,556 
The show out here. 

822 
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:54,100 
- Bunnies, bunnies. 
- Playboy bunnies? 

823 
01:05:54,225 --> 01:05:56,060 
You got it. 
You gonna be here? 

824 
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:59,397 
Hey, listen, Captain, 
on the house. 

825 
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:03,401 
No hard feelings, huh? 

826 
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:40,647 
<i>How ya doin' out there? </i> 

827 
01:06:40,772 --> 01:06:43,566 
<i>I said, how ya doin' out there? </i> 

828 
01:06:43,691 --> 01:06:45,985 
<i>Wanna say hello to you 
from all of us up here... </i> 

829 
01:06:46,111 --> 01:06:47,987 
<i>to all of you 
out there who work... </i> 

830 
01:06:48,113 --> 01:06:51,282 
<i>so goddam hard 
in Operation Brute Force! </i> 

831 
01:06:51,408 --> 01:06:54,619 
<i>Hello, all you 
paratroopers out there! </i> 

832 
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:58,206 
<i>And the marines! 
And the sailors! </i> 

833 
01:06:58,331 --> 01:07:00,250 
<i>We wanna let you know 
that we're proud of you! </i> 

834 
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:03,962 
<i>We know how tough 
and how hard it's been. </i> 

835 
01:07:04,087 --> 01:07:07,132 
<i>To prove it we're gonna give you 
entertainment you're gonna like. </i> 

836 
01:07:07,257 --> 01:07:11,386 
<i>Miss August, 
Miss Sandra Beatty. </i> 

837 
01:07:13,012 --> 01:07:17,475 
<i>Miss May, 
Miss Terri Teray! Yeah! </i> 

838 
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:23,440 
<i>And the playmate of the year, 
Miss Carrie Foster! Yeah! </i> 

839 
01:07:23,565 --> 01:07:25,733 
Yo! Whoa! 

840 
01:07:25,859 --> 01:07:28,820 
<i>Oh, Susie-Q</i> 

841 
01:07:28,945 --> 01:07:31,823 
<i>Oh, Susie-Q</i> 

842 
01:07:33,158 --> 01:07:36,619 
<i>- Oh, Susie-Q baby, I love you 
- Hello!</i> 

843 
01:07:36,745 --> 01:07:39,289 
<i>Susie-Q</i> 

844 
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:43,835 
<i>I like the way you walk</i> 

845 
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,045 
<i>I like the way you talk</i> 

846 
01:07:46,171 --> 01:07:49,424 
<i>I like the way you walk</i> 

847 
01:07:49,549 --> 01:07:53,428 
<i>I like the way you talk 
Susie-Q</i> 

848 
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:58,349 
<i>Oh, Susie-Q</i> 

849 
01:07:58,475 --> 01:08:00,560 
<i>Oh, Susie-Q</i> 

850 
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:06,232 
<i>Oh, Susie-Q 
Baby, I love you</i> 

851 
01:08:06,357 --> 01:08:08,276 
<i>Susie-Q</i> 

852 
01:08:08,401 --> 01:08:11,404 
<i>I love you! </i> 

853 
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:17,077 
- Come on! 
- What's the matter? 

854 
01:08:17,202 --> 01:08:19,120 
Come on, baby! 

855 
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,670 
Grease my gun! 

856 
01:08:35,053 --> 01:08:37,430 
I'm ready to powwow, baby! 

857 
01:08:52,195 --> 01:08:54,239 
Come on! All right! 

858 
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:56,574 
You're cute. I like you. 

859 
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:59,828 
I'm here, baby! I'm here! 

860 
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:06,709 
Yeah! 

861 
01:09:06,835 --> 01:09:09,129 
- You fucking bitch! 
- Take it off! 

862 
01:09:09,254 --> 01:09:10,880 
Take it off! 

863 
01:09:11,005 --> 01:09:14,634 
Hey, lover! 
You want us to come over! 

864 
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:18,721 
- I sure do! 
- Sign my centerfold! 

865 
01:09:21,099 --> 01:09:22,976 
Sign my centerfold! 

866 
01:09:23,101 --> 01:09:25,770 
Come on, baby! 

867 
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:28,189 
Goddam! 

868 
01:09:38,533 --> 01:09:41,244 
Start her up. Hey! 

869 
01:09:41,369 --> 01:09:45,331 
Get out of my way! 

870 
01:09:45,457 --> 01:09:47,083 
Come on! 

871 
01:09:50,253 --> 01:09:53,882 
- Will you sign these? 
- Let's go! Let's go! 

872 
01:09:59,637 --> 01:10:02,724 
Hurry! 

873 
01:10:12,859 --> 01:10:14,778 
So long! 

874 
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,656 
<i>Charlie didn't get much USO. </i> 

875 
01:11:01,074 --> 01:11:05,370 
<i>He was dug in too deep 
or moving too fast. </i> 

876 
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:13,420 
<i>His idea of great R and R was 
cold rice and a little rat meat. </i> 

877 
01:11:14,754 --> 01:11:17,590 
<i>He had only two ways home... </i> 

878 
01:11:17,715 --> 01:11:21,136 
<i>death or victory. </i> 

879 
01:11:32,105 --> 01:11:35,233 
<i>No wonder Kurtz put 
a weed up Command's ass. </i> 

880 
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:40,071 
<i>The war was being run by 
a bunch of four-star clowns... </i> 

881 
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:44,409 
<i>who were gonna end up 
giving the whole circus away. </i> 

882 
01:11:44,534 --> 01:11:47,412 
Hey, you know, man, 
that was far-fucking-out. 

883 
01:11:47,537 --> 01:11:51,082 
I collected every picture of her 
since she was Miss December, Chief. 

884 
01:11:51,207 --> 01:11:54,127 
Hey, Clean, look at that. 
She was here, man. 

885 
01:11:54,252 --> 01:11:57,088 
I even wrote to the cunt. 
She didn't write me back. 

886 
01:11:57,213 --> 01:11:59,174 
You can really get hung up 
on these broads, man... 

887 
01:11:59,299 --> 01:12:01,176 
just like that cat in the delta. 

888 
01:12:01,301 --> 01:12:03,386 
- Yeah, you better believe it. 
- What cat? 

889 
01:12:03,511 --> 01:12:06,473 
The one that went up for murder. 
He was an army sergeant. 

890 
01:12:06,598 --> 01:12:11,102 
<i>Remember? This cat, man... 
He really dug his Playboy,  man.</i> 

891 
01:12:11,227 --> 01:12:12,395 
Dig it. 

892 
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,607 
When the thing arrived, 
he was there to meet it, man. 

893 
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:19,277 
Look at these beautiful 
fuckin' jugs, man! 

894 
01:12:19,402 --> 01:12:22,280 
Yeah, so anyway, 
he was workin' ARVN patrols. 

895 
01:12:22,405 --> 01:12:25,867 
One of them cocky gook asshole 
lieutenants and shit... 

896 
01:12:25,992 --> 01:12:29,120 
One day the gook took his magazine 
and wouldn't give it back. 

897 
01:12:29,245 --> 01:12:31,831 
He said, "Give me 
my magazine back." 

898 
01:12:31,956 --> 01:12:35,627 
Gook say, "You shut up. 
I have you court-martialed." 

899 
01:12:35,752 --> 01:12:37,879 
- Typical fuckin' ARVN. 
- Yeah! 

900 
01:12:38,004 --> 01:12:41,925 
- Then the gook starts to go too far. 
- Chef. Take the wheel. 

901 
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:46,137 
This dude started to stick 
pinholes in the lady's tits. 

902 
01:12:46,262 --> 01:12:47,680 
Take the wheel. 

903 
01:12:47,806 --> 01:12:52,143 
He started sticking pinholes 
and mutilating the centerfold. 

904 
01:12:52,268 --> 01:12:55,230 
The sergeant said, 
"You better not do that to her. 

905 
01:12:55,355 --> 01:12:57,315 
You leave your shitty little 
gook hands off of that girl. 

906 
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,317 
Don't do her like that." 

907 
01:12:59,442 --> 01:13:04,197 
- Gook say "Fuck you" in Vietnamese. 
- Damn. 

908 
01:13:04,322 --> 01:13:07,575 
The sergeant couldn't 
handle it no more. 

909 
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,953 
He just picked up his iron... 

910 
01:13:10,078 --> 01:13:12,455 
flipped it to 
rock and roll and... 

911 
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:14,624 
Boom! 

912 
01:13:14,749 --> 01:13:17,460 
<i>Gave that little zero a long burst 
straight through the Playboy mag.</i> 

913 
01:13:17,585 --> 01:13:20,505 
It blew his ass clean 
off of the dock. 

914 
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:25,885 
There wasn't no more lieutenant 
that day. That was it for his ass. 

915 
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:29,889 
- They burn him for it? 
- The sergeant? Yeah, man. 

916 
01:13:30,014 --> 01:13:32,016 
They stuck his ass 
in the LBJ. 

917 
01:13:32,142 --> 01:13:35,812 
It's too bad he didn't 
get no medals or nothin'. 

918 
01:13:38,189 --> 01:13:40,233 
Fuckin' ARVN, man. 

919 
01:13:40,358 --> 01:13:42,235 
They should have killed the fuck. 

920 
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:46,531 
Should have given 
the fucker a Silver Star. 

921 
01:13:46,656 --> 01:13:51,369 
Bummer for the gook though, 
ain't it? 

922 
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:57,083 
<i>Good morning, Vietnam. </i> 

923 
01:13:57,208 --> 01:14:00,003 
<i>I'm Army Specialist

Look out, Lance! 

952

964

Shit. Chicken time. 

965 
01:16:09,466 --> 01:16:12,552 
You ain't shittin', bro. 
They're motherfuckin'. 

966

Who is that? 

967 
01:16:17,515 --> 01:16:20,518 
Is that you, Lazzaro? 

968 
01:16:20,643 --> 01:16:23,021 
Don't chicken out. 

969 
01:16:28,985 --> 01:16:32,989 
Lazzaro!

- Fire on the canopy! 
- I got it! Get outta there!

974 
01:16:46,795 --> 01:16:49,589 
Put that fucker out, man! 

975 
01:16:56,346 --> 01:16:59,307 
What the fuck 
they think they're doin'? 

976 
01:17:22,372 --> 01:17:26,418 
<i>Late summer, autumn 1968.</i> 

977 
01:17:26,543 --> 01:17:30,755 
<i>Kurtz's patrols in the highlands 
coming under frequent ambush. </i> 

978 
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,091 
<i>The camp started falling apart. </i> 

979 
01:17:39,431 --> 01:17:41,391 
<i>November. </i> 

980 
01:17:41,516 --> 01:17:46,271 
<i>Kurtz orders assassination of 
three Vietnamese men and one woman. </i> 

981 
01:17:46,396 --> 01:17:50,483 
<i>Two of the men were colonels 
in the South Vietnamese army. </i> 

982 
01:17:52,777 --> 01:17:55,697 
<i>Enemy activity in his old sector 
dropped off to nothing. </i> 

983 
01:17:59,242 --> 01:18:04,247 
<i>Guess he must have hit 
the right four people. </i> 

984 
01:18:04,372 --> 01:18:09,878 
<i>He joined the Special Forces. 
After that his... </i> 

985 
01:18:10,003 --> 01:18:13,423 
<i>The army tried one last time 
to bring him back into the fold. </i> 

986 
01:18:13,548 --> 01:18:16,050 
<i>- Methods... 
- If he'd pulled over... </i> 

987 
01:18:16,176 --> 01:18:19,137 
<i>- It all would have been forgotten. 
- Unsound.</i> 

988 
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:21,139 
<i>But he kept going. </i> 

989 
01:18:21,264 --> 01:18:24,350 
<i>- Now he's crossed into Cambodia... 
- He kept winning it his way. </i> 

990 
01:18:24,476 --> 01:18:27,437 
<i>- With this Montagnard army of his... 
- And they called me in. </i> 

991 
01:18:27,562 --> 01:18:32,400 
<i>Man like a god and follow 
every order, however ridiculous. </i> 

992 
01:18:35,612 --> 01:18:38,615 
<i>They lost him. </i> 

993 
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:41,201 
<i>He was gone. </i> 

994 
01:18:41,326 --> 01:18:44,204 
<i>Nothing but rumors 
and random intelligence... </i> 

995 
01:18:44,329 --> 01:18:48,124 
<i>mostly from captured VC. </i> 

996 
01:18:48,249 --> 01:18:52,462 
<i>The VC knew his name by now, 
and they were scared of him. </i> 

997 
01:18:52,587 --> 01:18:54,589 
<i>He and his men were 
playing hit-and-run... </i> 

998 
01:18:54,714 --> 01:18:57,300 
<i>all the way into Cambodia. </i> 

999 
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:04,182 
I know what I'm doin'. 

1000 
01:19:04,307 --> 01:19:06,351 
I'm goin' to the White House 
to have dinner... 

1001 
01:19:06,476 --> 01:19:09,104 
with the president 
of the United States. 

1002 
01:19:09,229 --> 01:19:11,356 
That's where I'm goin'. 

1003 
01:19:11,481 --> 01:19:13,858 
Hey, Chef, 
put the cover on that. 

1004 
01:19:15,402 --> 01:19:17,987 
Clean. 

1005 
01:19:20,615 --> 01:19:23,159 
How long has that kid 
been on this boat? 

1006 
01:19:23,284 --> 01:19:25,328 
Seven months. 

1007 
01:19:25,453 --> 01:19:28,748 
He's really specializing 
in busting my balls. 

1008 
01:19:28,873 --> 01:19:31,543 
Very possible, Captain, 
he thinks the same of you. 

1009 
01:19:31,668 --> 01:19:37,048 
- Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief? 
- I don't think. 

1010 
01:19:37,173 --> 01:19:39,759 
My orders say I'm not supposed to 
know where I'm taking this boat... 

1011 
01:19:39,884 --> 01:19:41,761 
so I don't! 

1012 
01:19:41,886 --> 01:19:47,225 
But one look at you, and I know 
it's gonna be hot, wherever it is. 

1013 
01:19:55,942 --> 01:19:59,779 
We're going upriver about 
75 clicks above the Do Lung Bridge. 

1014 
01:20:04,075 --> 01:20:07,078 
- That's Cambodia, Captain. 
- That's classified. 

1015 
01:20:07,203 --> 01:20:12,167 
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia, 
but that's where I'm going. 

1016 
01:20:12,292 --> 01:20:14,794 
You just get me close 
to my destination... 

1017 
01:20:14,919 --> 01:20:16,838 
and I'll cut you 
and the crew loose. 

1018 
01:20:20,133 --> 01:20:22,218 
All right, Captain. 

1019 
01:20:43,698 --> 01:20:45,784 
<i>"Dear Son... </i>

four Vietnamese double agents. </i> 

1025

we acted... we acted like soldiers. </i> 

1027

01:22:53,703 --> 01:22:55,663 
- Hi there! 
- How ya doin'? 

1049 
01:22:55,789 --> 01:22:57,832 
Wow. That's a nice 
little boat you got there. 

1050 
01:22:57,957 --> 01:23:00,043 
Never seen one 
up here before. 

1051 
01:23:00,168 --> 01:23:03,088 
We called in a request

Medevac? No. 

1053 
01:23:05,215 --> 01:23:07,550 
We passed a downed Huey

- Yeah.

- Way up.

- Way upriver? Forget it. 
- Why? 

1057 
01:23:18,061 --> 01:23:21,564 
We want to send 
some people downriver. 

1058 
01:23:21,689 --> 01:23:24,025 
- Just forget it. 
- What the fuck was that? 

1059 
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:27,695 
- We'll be back in a couple of days. 
- Yeah, right, you'll be back. 

1060 
01:23:34,077 --> 01:23:35,954 
- Chief? 
- Yeah, Captain? 

1061 
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:37,956 
Why don't you see what 
you can do with that engine? 

1062 
01:23:38,081 --> 01:23:39,999 
- I'm gonna look around. 
- All right. 

1063 
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:43,503 
Hey, don't leave without me.

Hey, soldier, where's your CO? 

1065

Don't ask me, man. 

1066

Give my clothes back, 
you asshole!

Asshole!

Hey, guys, where's the CO? 

1069 
01:24:44,981 --> 01:24:50,028 
He stepped on a land mine about two 
months ago. He got blown to hell. 

1070 
01:24:50,153 --> 01:24:53,073 
- Who's in charge here? 
- Charge? 

1071

I don't know, man. 
I'm just the night man.

Just do what I'm told. Shit. 
I'm just a working girl.

Hey, Lance, man, I'm telling you 
it's gonna jam. You mark my words. 

1075 
01:25:05,293 --> 01:25:08,046 
- Keep it in that condition... 
- Get off my back! 

1076 
01:25:08,171 --> 01:25:10,215 
- No, man, I'm telling you... 
- Lay off! 

1077 
01:25:11,716 --> 01:25:15,178 
Hey! Hey! Come here! 

1078 
01:25:15,303 --> 01:25:17,931 
Is that your boat? 
Come on inside. 

1079 
01:25:18,014 --> 01:25:20,600 
What do you want? 

1080 
01:25:20,725 --> 01:25:23,937 
Come on inside. 
I want to talk to you. Come on! 

1081 
01:25:26,481 --> 01:25:28,566 
Get out of the rain. 

1082 
01:25:28,691 --> 01:25:31,027 
Get off me! 

1083 
01:25:31,152 --> 01:25:33,363 
Come on. Cut this shit. 
Hey, Chef. Hey, come on. 

1084 
01:25:33,488 --> 01:25:38,076 
Hey, how ya doin', Captain? 
I want you to meet some people. 

1085 
01:25:38,201 --> 01:25:41,913 
- I got your ass. 
- Your ass is shit. 

1086 
01:25:42,038 --> 01:25:45,083 
Chef, your ass is shit! 

1087 
01:25:50,713 --> 01:25:54,259 
You're a motherfucker, man. 

1088 
01:25:54,384 --> 01:25:57,011 
Goddam, my ear, 
you motherfucker! 

1089 
01:25:59,389 --> 01:26:02,976 
- Get him off me, Chef. 
- You smart-ass. 

1090 
01:26:03,101 --> 01:26:05,228 
Hey, guys. 

1091 
01:26:05,353 --> 01:26:08,106 
I got you! 
I got your ass! 

1092 
01:26:08,231 --> 01:26:11,651 
- You ain't shit, Chef. 
- Hey, fellas. 

1093 
01:26:11,776 --> 01:26:15,780 
- You pulled my fuckin'... 
- Hey, guys. 

1094 
01:26:15,905 --> 01:26:19,409 
I just made a deal with 
the people from Hau Phat. 

1095 
01:26:19,534 --> 01:26:24,289 
I negotiated two barrels of fuel for 
a couple of hours with the bunnies. 

1096 
01:26:29,961 --> 01:26:32,464 
Whoa. Whoa. Captain! 

1097 
01:26:32,589 --> 01:26:35,467 
Hey! Hey! You shittin' me? 

1098 
01:26:35,592 --> 01:26:39,137 
No, I'm not. Grab a couple of 
barrels and get up to that big tent. 

1099 
01:26:39,262 --> 01:26:41,306 
Come on! 

1100 
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:44,434 
Captain. 

1101 
01:26:44,559 --> 01:26:47,937 
You're giving away our fuel 
for a playmate of the month? 

1102 
01:26:48,062 --> 01:26:52,150 
Nope, playmate 
of the year, Chief. 

1103 
01:26:52,275 --> 01:26:55,904 
Warm 'em up, baby! 
Warm 'em up! 

1104 
01:26:56,029 --> 01:26:58,698 
Captain, we get in a fire fight 
and run out of fuel... 

1105 
01:26:58,823 --> 01:27:01,326 
I want you to tell me 
how she was. 

1106 
01:27:01,451 --> 01:27:06,456 
I made a deal for all of us, Chief. 
How about you? 

1107 
01:27:09,084 --> 01:27:12,462 
- You got some mamas in there? 
- Some what? 

1108 
01:27:14,631 --> 01:27:18,218 
Forget it, Captain. 
I'll stay with the boat. 

1109 
01:27:18,343 --> 01:27:21,930 
Hey, Captain! 
Give me a hand. 

1110 
01:27:41,157 --> 01:27:43,034 
You know, I got a... 

1111 
01:27:43,159 --> 01:27:45,245 
I got every one 
of your pictures. 

1112 
01:27:45,370 --> 01:27:48,206 
I got the centerfold, 
the playmate's review... 

1113 
01:27:48,331 --> 01:27:51,000 
the playmate of the year run-off. 

1114 
01:27:51,126 --> 01:27:53,044 
I even got the calendar. 

1115 
01:27:53,169 --> 01:27:58,425 
<i>Hey, oiseau. 
How come you got a bird?</i> 

1116 
01:27:58,550 --> 01:28:01,428 
I used to be the bird girl 
at Busch Gardens. 

1117 
01:28:01,553 --> 01:28:05,640 
- Busch Gardens? 
- I used to train birds there. 

1118 
01:28:05,765 --> 01:28:07,642 
You are... 

1119 
01:28:07,767 --> 01:28:10,854 
- You are Miss December, aren't you? 
- Miss May. 

1120 
01:28:10,979 --> 01:28:12,939 
Is it coming? 

1121 
01:28:19,487 --> 01:28:23,241 
- Miss December has black hair. 
- It's over there. 

1122 
01:28:23,366 --> 01:28:27,078 
He's not one 
of my regular birds. 

1123 
01:28:27,203 --> 01:28:31,082 
Come on. Come on, baby. Snack? 
Snatch a crack. Come here. 

1124 
01:28:31,207 --> 01:28:34,544 
Being playmate of the year... 

1125 
01:28:34,669 --> 01:28:38,173 
is the loneliest experience 
I can imagine. 

1126 
01:28:39,382 --> 01:28:42,886 
It's like... 
You try to express... 

1127 
01:28:43,011 --> 01:28:47,807 
your feelings to someone 
and show them your heart... 

1128 
01:28:47,932 --> 01:28:49,809 
Yeah, I want to hear 
about your bird act. 

1129 
01:28:49,934 --> 01:28:51,811 
I'd love to hear 
about your bird act. 

1130 
01:28:51,936 --> 01:28:55,815 
But would you mind 
just puttin' this... 

1131 
01:28:55,940 --> 01:29:00,612 
Would you just mind putting 
this black wig on for me, please? 

1132 
01:29:00,737 --> 01:29:03,448 
And there's 
this glass wall between you... 

1133 
01:29:03,573 --> 01:29:06,201 
this invisible glass. 

1134 
01:29:06,326 --> 01:29:08,953 
They can see 
your mouth moving. 

1135 
01:29:09,079 --> 01:29:11,498 
I used to train birds 
for at least two years... 

1136 
01:29:11,623 --> 01:29:13,541 
- That's beautiful. 
- At Busch Gardens. 

1137 
01:29:13,666 --> 01:29:16,920 
This was cascading over your 
right shoulder. This was open here. 

1138 
01:29:17,045 --> 01:29:20,632 
But they can't hear 
what you're saying. 

1139 
01:29:20,757 --> 01:29:24,677 
I used to train them to stand 
on their head and ride a bicycle... 

1140 
01:29:24,803 --> 01:29:26,679 
Your right hand was... 

1141 
01:29:26,805 --> 01:29:28,681 
Hey, Chef! 

1142 
01:29:28,807 --> 01:29:31,810 
- Get outta here, man! 
- Come on! 

1143 
01:29:31,935 --> 01:29:34,813 
- Does he want to talk to you? 
- Later. Give me 15 minutes. 

1144 
01:29:34,938 --> 01:29:38,983 
You can never really make them hear 
what you're trying to say. 

1145 
01:29:39,109 --> 01:29:42,153 
You okay with kind of bending? 
That's it. 

1146 
01:29:42,278 --> 01:29:44,697 
Your ass was sticking out 
just a little... Hey, man, fuck off! 

1147 
01:29:44,823 --> 01:29:46,783 
Fifteen minutes! 

1148 
01:29:46,908 --> 01:29:50,745 
That's why I tried 
so desperately... 

1149 
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:54,332 
to show somebody 
that I had some talent. 

1150 
01:29:54,457 --> 01:29:56,376 
Little baby macaws. 

1151 
01:29:56,501 --> 01:29:59,337 
- Have you ever seen a baby macaw? 
- That's kind of open there. 

1152 
01:29:59,462 --> 01:30:01,673 
- They're all blue... 
- Take off, would you? 

1153 
01:30:01,798 --> 01:30:04,968 
I got my rights, man! 

1154 
01:30:05,093 --> 01:30:07,804 
They make you do things 
you don't wanna do... 

1155 
01:30:07,929 --> 01:30:11,433 
like, this picture here. 

1156 
01:30:14,227 --> 01:30:18,565 
I started feeling 
repulsed with myself. 

1157 
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:22,277 
You were just kind of bending 
forward. Your ass kind of out a bit. 

1158 
01:30:22,402 --> 01:30:25,029 
- I love training birds. 
- That's it. 

1159 
01:30:25,155 --> 01:30:28,533 
That's it. That's very... 
That's it. Voila. 

1160 
01:30:28,658 --> 01:30:32,704 
You're beautiful. 
I just want to... 

1161 
01:30:32,829 --> 01:30:35,707 
You know, I can't believe it. 

1162 
01:30:35,832 --> 01:30:40,044 
Me, J. Hicks. 
I can't believe I'm really here. 

1163 
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:44,758 
Maybe I'm unfit 
to have a relationship... 

1164 
01:30:44,883 --> 01:30:49,721 
with a beautiful, innocent boy. 

1165 
01:30:49,846 --> 01:30:53,349 
Just think, if it hadn't 
been for the Vietnam War... 

1166 
01:30:53,475 --> 01:30:55,727 
I never would have met you, 
Miss December. 

1167 
01:30:55,852 --> 01:30:57,395 
Miss May. 

1168 
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:02,275 
I wish... 
I wish I could find... 

1169 
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,236 
just one person... 

1170 
01:31:06,863 --> 01:31:09,741 
that could share 
my point of view. 

1171 
01:31:16,289 --> 01:31:18,333 
Oh, you kiss like a bird! 

1172 
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:20,668 
Oh, God! Kiss me! Kiss me! 

1173 
01:31:21,669 --> 01:31:23,046 
Who is that? 

1174 
01:31:23,171 --> 01:31:28,802 
- You're drivin' me crazy! Kiss me! 
- I love birds! 

1175 
01:31:32,847 --> 01:31:36,518 
You finished yet? 

1176 
01:31:36,643 --> 01:31:39,437 
Oh! Fuck! 

1177 
01:31:39,562 --> 01:31:41,981 
Like a bird! 
Take me like a bird! 

1178 
01:31:42,065 --> 01:31:45,276 
Fly, baby! Cock it to me! 

1179 
01:31:45,402 --> 01:31:48,071 
- Fly! 
- I can fly like an eagle! 

1180 
01:31:48,196 --> 01:31:51,032 
- Fly like an eagle! 
- It drives me crazy! 

1181 
01:31:51,116 --> 01:31:54,285 
It drives me crazy! 

1182 
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:06,214 
Lance, that was somebody's son. 

1183 
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:13,096 
Lance, there were things 
that they made me do... 

1184 
01:32:13,221 --> 01:32:15,306 
that I didn't want to do. 

1185 
01:32:15,432 --> 01:32:19,144 
They said, "Pull the ribbons 
between your legs." 

1186 
01:32:19,269 --> 01:32:21,646 
I didn't want to do it. 

1187 
01:32:21,771 --> 01:32:25,483 
But they said that was 
what was expected of me... 

1188 
01:32:25,608 --> 01:32:28,361 
that that's what people 
wanted to see. 

1189 
01:32:50,049 --> 01:32:54,012 
- Who are you? 
- Well, I'm next, ma'am. 

1190 
01:32:54,137 --> 01:32:56,765 
Ha, ha! Hell, 
I didn't know it was a cherry. 

1191 
01:32:56,890 --> 01:32:59,559 
- Didn't know you never got no pussy. 
- Shove it, fuckup. 

1192 
01:32:59,684 --> 01:33:02,520 
Sorry about that. If I'd have 
known, I'd take you to New Orleans. 

1193 
01:33:02,645 --> 01:33:05,023 
- Man, fuck you. 
- Introduce you to... 

1194 
01:33:05,148 --> 01:33:08,651 
- Lay off, Chef. 
- Cherry boy, cherry boy. 

1195 
01:33:08,777 --> 01:33:11,029 
You're a fuckin' dog! 

1196 
01:33:11,154 --> 01:33:14,365 
Come to New Orleans. 
I'll get you fixed up, ya prick. 

1197 
01:33:14,491 --> 01:33:16,367 
Lay off, Chef. 

1198 
01:33:16,493 --> 01:33:18,369 
You're the only fuckin' prick 
I see around here. 

1199 
01:33:18,495 --> 01:33:20,371 
If I wanna play with a prick, 
I'll play with my own. 

1200 
01:33:20,497 --> 01:33:21,372 
Lay off! 

1201 
01:33:21,498 --> 01:33:24,042 
What are you gonna 
do with it, cherry boy? 

1202 
01:33:24,167 --> 01:33:25,543 
Chef, I said lay off! 

1203 
01:33:25,668 --> 01:33:30,048 
Chef, knock it off! Give him 
a break! What do you think I said? 

1204 
01:33:30,173 --> 01:33:32,092 
Then give your jaws a rest! 

1205 
01:33:32,217 --> 01:33:36,221 
This ain't the army. 
You are a sailor! 

1206 
01:33:36,346 --> 01:33:38,556 
So get out of that 
frizzly army-looking shirt... 

1207 
01:33:38,681 --> 01:33:40,600 
and stop smoking that dope! 

1208 
01:33:40,725 --> 01:33:42,644 
You hear me? 

1209 
01:33:46,481 --> 01:33:49,109 
Lance, what's with 
all the green paint? 

1210 
01:33:49,234 --> 01:33:51,569 
- Camouflage. 
- How's that? 

1211 
01:33:51,694 --> 01:33:53,738 
So they can't see ya. 
They're everywhere, Chief. 

1212 
01:33:53,863 --> 01:33:57,283 
I want you to stay awake up there, 
man. You got a job to do. 

1213 
01:34:14,509 --> 01:34:18,388 
Sampan off the port bow. 
Sampan off the port bow. 

1214 
01:34:18,513 --> 01:34:20,932 
Let's take a look. Lance. 

1215 
01:34:21,057 --> 01:34:25,520 
Bring them in. 
Clean, on the 60. Chef, get a 16. 

1216 
01:34:25,645 --> 01:34:28,314 
Clean, get on that 60! 

1217 
01:34:30,066 --> 01:34:31,943 
What's up, Chief? 

1218 
01:34:33,403 --> 01:34:35,780 
A junk boat, Captain. 
We're gonna take a routine check. 

1219 
01:34:35,905 --> 01:34:39,284 
Well, let's forget routine now 
and let 'em go. 

1220 
01:34:39,409 --> 01:34:42,287 
These boats are running supplies 
in this delta, Captain. 

1221 
01:34:42,412 --> 01:34:44,831 
I'm gonna take a look. 

1222 
01:34:44,956 --> 01:34:46,875 
My mission's got priority. 

1223 
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,836 
You wouldn't even be in this part 
of the river if it wasn't for me. 

1224 
01:34:49,961 --> 01:34:53,465 
Until we reach your destination, 
Captain, you're just on for the ride. 

1225 
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:57,302 
- Stand by, Lance. 
- Come on. Throw the rope, asshole. 

1226 
01:34:57,427 --> 01:35:00,346 
All right. Come on. 
Let's bring it over. 

1227 
01:35:13,485 --> 01:35:16,905 
Look in that forward hooch. 
Bring the people out of there. 

1228 
01:35:22,744 --> 01:35:26,081 
Come on! 
Hurry up, motherfucker! 

1229 
01:35:27,749 --> 01:35:28,958 
<i>Can couc,  you too.</i> 

1230 
01:35:29,084 --> 01:35:31,377 
- Keep your eyes open, Clean. 
- I got you, Chief. 

1231 
01:35:35,673 --> 01:35:38,009 
It's clear, Chief. 

1232 
01:35:42,764 --> 01:35:46,893 
Okay, that's them. 
That's them. They're okay. 

1233 
01:35:47,018 --> 01:35:49,687 
- Board and search it. 
- It's just a fuckin' boat. 

1234 
01:35:49,813 --> 01:35:51,689 
- There ain't nothin' on it. 
- Board it and search it. 

1235 
01:35:51,815 --> 01:35:55,026 
Just some baskets and 
some ducks, fuckin' bananas. 

1236 
01:35:55,151 --> 01:35:56,986 
- Ain't nothin' on it. 
- Chef? 

1237 
01:35:57,112 --> 01:36:00,907 
- What's wrong? Search it. 
- There's the goat and some fish. 

1238 
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:02,909 
- Chef! 
- Fuckin' vegetables... 

1239 
01:36:02,992 --> 01:36:04,911 
- Get on that boat! 
- There's nothin' on it, man! 

1240 
01:36:04,994 --> 01:36:06,538 
- Get on it! 
- All right! 

1241 
01:36:06,663 --> 01:36:09,958 
Move it, asshole! 
Goddam it! 

1242 
01:36:10,041 --> 01:36:12,293 
Just some pigs! Look, mangoes! 

1243 
01:36:12,419 --> 01:36:14,921 
- What's in the rice bag? 
- Fuckin' rice! 

1244 
01:36:15,004 --> 01:36:17,424 
- Look in there! 
- Some fuckin' fish! 

1245 
01:36:17,549 --> 01:36:22,595 
More coconuts. 
Rice. Here's rice. 

1246 
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,931 
- What's in that vegetable basket? 
- Get out of here! 

1247 
01:36:25,014 --> 01:36:26,933 
Come on! 

1248 
01:36:27,016 --> 01:36:29,060 
Check that vegetable basket! 

1249 
01:36:29,185 --> 01:36:31,062 
- All right! 
- Shut up, slope! 

1250 
01:36:31,187 --> 01:36:34,232 
- There ain't nothin' in here! 
- What's in the boxes? 

1251 
01:36:34,357 --> 01:36:36,109 
- Look in that rusty can. 
- Nothing! 

1252 
01:36:36,234 --> 01:36:39,028 
Just fuckin' rice! 
There ain't nothin' on it! 

1253 
01:36:39,154 --> 01:36:42,323 
Check the yellow can! 
She was sittin' on it. What's in it? 

1254 
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:48,079 
Chef! 

1255 
01:36:51,082 --> 01:36:54,335 
Motherfuckers! 

1256 
01:36:56,671 --> 01:36:59,424 
Motherfuckers! 

1257 
01:37:01,342 --> 01:37:04,804 
- Hold it! 
- Come on! Let's kill them all. 

1258 
01:37:04,929 --> 01:37:08,266 
- Motherfucking cocksuckers mothers! 
- Hold it! Hold it! 

1259 
01:37:08,391 --> 01:37:10,518 
Let's kill all the assholes! 
Shoot the shit outta all of 'em. 

1260 
01:37:10,643 --> 01:37:13,897 
- Hold it! 
- Why not? Jesus Christ. 

1261 
01:37:14,022 --> 01:37:17,776 
Why the fuck not? 

1262 
01:37:17,901 --> 01:37:21,154 
- Clean? 
- I'm good. 

1263 
01:37:27,911 --> 01:37:29,996 
- You okay, Lance? 
- Shit! Fuck! Shit! 

1264 
01:37:30,121 --> 01:37:32,791 
- Chef! 
- Look what she was hiding! 

1265 
01:37:32,916 --> 01:37:36,044 
- You all right? 
- See what she was runnin' for? 

1266 
01:37:38,671 --> 01:37:40,632 
It's a fuckin' puppy. 

1267 
01:37:40,757 --> 01:37:43,635 
It's a fuckin' puppy. 

1268 
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,012 
Give me that dog! 

1269 
01:37:46,137 --> 01:37:48,056 
- Give me that dog! 
- No! You're not gonna get it! 

1270 
01:37:48,181 --> 01:37:51,434 
- Give it to me! 
- Give me the fuckin' dog, asshole! 

1271 
01:37:51,559 --> 01:37:54,646 
Fuck you! Fuckin' mango too! 

1272 
01:37:54,771 --> 01:37:56,064 
- Chef... 
- You want that? 

1273 
01:37:56,189 --> 01:37:59,901 
She's moving behind you. 
She's alive. Check her out. 

1274 
01:37:59,984 --> 01:38:02,695 
Chef! She's moving behind you. 
Check her out! 

1275 
01:38:02,821 --> 01:38:06,324 
All right. All right. 
Come on, Clean! Goddam it! 

1276 
01:38:06,449 --> 01:38:09,619 
She's not dead. She's wounded. 
Give him a hand. 

1277 
01:38:09,744 --> 01:38:11,704 
Just take it easy. 
Take it easy! 

1278 
01:38:11,830 --> 01:38:15,125 
- Slow down and take it easy. 
- Chef, wait a minute. 

1279 
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:17,127 
- Bring her up. 
- Is she breathing? 

1280 
01:38:17,252 --> 01:38:21,339 
She's hurt. She's bleedin'. 

1281 
01:38:21,464 --> 01:38:23,842 
Bring her on board. 
We're taking her to an ARVN. 

1282 
01:38:23,967 --> 01:38:26,803 
- What are you talking about? 
- We're taking her to some friendlies. 

1283 
01:38:26,928 --> 01:38:29,848 
- She's wounded. She's not dead. 
- Get out of there. 

1284 
01:38:29,973 --> 01:38:31,182 
The book says... 

1285 
01:38:42,026 --> 01:38:45,280 
Fuck you. Fuck him. 

1286 
01:38:45,405 --> 01:38:47,323 
I told you not to stop. 
Now let's go. 

1287 
01:39:45,842 --> 01:39:48,970 
<i>It was a way we had over here 
of living with ourselves. </i> 

1288 
01:39:50,138 --> 01:39:53,600 
<i>We'd cut 'em in half with a 
machine gun and give 'em a Band-Aid. </i> 

1289 
01:39:55,727 --> 01:39:58,063 
<i>It was a lie. </i> 

1290 
01:39:58,188 --> 01:40:00,774 
<i>And the more I saw of them... </i> 

1291 
01:40:00,899 --> 01:40:03,151 
<i>the more I hated lies. </i> 

1292 
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:08,698 
<i>Those boys were never gonna 
look at me the same way again... </i> 

1293 
01:40:09,783 --> 01:40:14,371 
<i>but I felt like I knew one or two things 
about Kurtz that weren't in the dossier. </i> 

1294 
01:40:19,751 --> 01:40:23,797 
<i>Do Lung Bridge was the last 
army outpost on the Nung River. </i> 

1295 
01:40:28,218 --> 01:40:30,512 
<i>Beyond it, 
there was only Kurtz. </i> 

1296 
01:40:35,267 --> 01:40:37,644 
- What do you think? 
- It's beautiful. 

1297 
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:41,064 
Huh? What's the matter with you? 

1298 
01:40:41,189 --> 01:40:43,650 
You're acting kind of weird. 

1299 
01:40:43,775 --> 01:40:46,987 
Hey, you know that last tab 
of acid I was saving? 

1300 
01:40:48,113 --> 01:40:51,116 
- I dropped it. 
- You dropped acid? 

1301 
01:40:51,116 --> 01:40:52,534 
Far out. 

1302 
01:40:54,661 --> 01:40:57,914 
Friendly! 
Friendly! Friendly! 

1303 
01:41:03,545 --> 01:41:04,838 
Take me home! 

1304 
01:41:04,963 --> 01:41:06,840 
Goddam it! 

1305 
01:41:06,965 --> 01:41:10,051 
- Fucking shore police! Shit! 
- Man, you wanna die? 

1306 
01:41:10,177 --> 01:41:12,095 
Don't keep goin'! 

1307 
01:41:14,473 --> 01:41:16,683 
- You fuckin' police! 
- Don't leave me! 

1308 
01:41:16,808 --> 01:41:18,894 
Fuck you! 

1309 
01:41:19,019 --> 01:41:21,104 
You'll get what you deserve! 

1310 
01:41:29,196 --> 01:41:31,281 
Is there a Captain Willard 
on board? 

1311 
01:41:31,406 --> 01:41:33,325 
- Yeah. 
- Captain Willard? 

1312 
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:36,787 
- Yeah. Who's that? 
- Lieutenant Carlsen, sir. 

1313 
01:41:36,912 --> 01:41:39,581 
Get that light off me! 

1314 
01:41:39,706 --> 01:41:42,667 
I was sent here from Nha Trang 
with these three days ago, sir. 

1315 
01:41:42,793 --> 01:41:46,213 
Expected you here a little sooner. 
This is mail for the boat. 

1316 
01:41:46,338 --> 01:41:48,715 
- Don't know how happy this makes me. 
- Why? 

1317 
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:51,468 
Now I can get out of here, 
if I can find a way. 

1318 
01:41:55,263 --> 01:41:58,683 
You're in the asshole 
of the world, Captain. 

1319 
01:42:03,021 --> 01:42:04,815 
Captain, where you going? 

1320 
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:08,693 
See if I can find some fuel 
and get some information. 

1321 
01:42:08,819 --> 01:42:10,904 
Pick me up at the other side 
of the bridge. 

1322 
01:42:11,029 --> 01:42:13,073 
Somebody go with him. Chef. 

1323 
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:15,033 
I'll go. 

1324 
01:42:15,158 --> 01:42:16,743 
I wanna go. 

1325 
01:43:09,254 --> 01:43:11,715 
Man, listen 
to the music, man. 

1326 
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,717 
Where can I find the CO? 

1327 
01:43:13,842 --> 01:43:15,719 
You came right to it, 
son of a bitch! 

1328 
01:43:18,054 --> 01:43:20,474 
Get down here! 

1329 
01:43:21,767 --> 01:43:24,895 
You still got 
a commanding officer here? 

1330 
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:27,647 
- Beverly Hills. 
- What? 

1331 
01:43:27,773 --> 01:43:32,319 
Straight up the road, there's a concrete 
fucking bunker called Beverly Hills! 

1332 
01:43:32,444 --> 01:43:35,614 
Where the fuck else 
do you think it would be? 

1333 
01:44:10,315 --> 01:44:13,318 
- Goddam it! You stepped in my face. 
- I thought you were dead. 

1334 
01:44:13,443 --> 01:44:15,654 
Well, you thought wrong, 
damn it! 

1335 
01:44:19,032 --> 01:44:21,201 
I told you to stop fucking 
with me, didn't I? 

1336 
01:44:21,326 --> 01:44:22,953 
You think you're so bad, 
huh, nigger? 

1337 
01:44:23,078 --> 01:44:25,080 
What are you shooting at, soldier? 

1338 
01:44:25,205 --> 01:44:27,249 
What the fuck 
ya think I'm shootin' at? 

1339 
01:44:27,374 --> 01:44:30,127 
I'm sorry, sir. There are gooks 
out there by the wire. 

1340 
01:44:30,252 --> 01:44:31,920 
But I think I killed them all. 

1341 
01:44:32,045 --> 01:44:34,131 
You ain't shot shit. Listen. 

1342 
01:44:35,799 --> 01:44:38,802 
Oh, shit. He's trying to call 
his friends. Send up a flare. 

1343 
01:44:47,227 --> 01:44:49,521 
Think you so bad, huh, nigger? 
You think you bad, huh? 

1344 
01:44:49,646 --> 01:44:51,022 
They're all dead, stupid. 

1345 
01:44:51,148 --> 01:44:54,192 
There's one still alive 
underneath them bodies. 

1346 
01:44:54,317 --> 01:44:55,819 
Who's the commanding 
officer here? 

1347 
01:44:56,987 --> 01:44:58,905 
Ain't you? 

1348 
01:45:00,615 --> 01:45:02,159 
You think you so bad? 

1349 
01:45:02,284 --> 01:45:06,747 
I got something for your ass now, 
nigger! I got something for you now! 

1350 
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:10,584 
He's underneath the bodies, man. 

1351 
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:14,129 
Go get the Roach for me. 

1352 
01:45:14,254 --> 01:45:17,841 
Go get the Roach, nigger! 
Go get the Roach. 

1353 
01:45:22,262 --> 01:45:24,598 
Roach. Roach. 

1354 
01:45:27,225 --> 01:45:29,186 
Got slopes on the wire, man. 
You hear 'em? 

1355 
01:45:30,103 --> 01:45:31,688 
Do you hear 'em? 

1356 
01:45:33,982 --> 01:45:36,610 
Fuck you, GI! 

1357 
01:45:36,735 --> 01:45:38,278 
We'll bust 'em! 

1358 
01:45:41,031 --> 01:45:43,700 
Hey, GI, fuck you! 

1359 
01:45:47,788 --> 01:45:49,539 
Fuck you, GI! 

1360 
01:45:50,624 --> 01:45:53,168 
Fuck you, GI! 

1361 
01:45:53,293 --> 01:45:55,462 
Hear him out there 
on the wire, man? 

1362 
01:45:58,090 --> 01:46:00,884 
- I kill you, GI! 
- You need a flare? 

1363 
01:46:05,764 --> 01:46:09,643 
He's close, man. 
He's real close. 

1364 
01:46:17,234 --> 01:46:20,737 
Fuck you, GI! 
I kill you! 

1365 
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:27,077 
Fuck you, GI! 

1366 
01:46:31,957 --> 01:46:33,917 
GI, fuck you! 

1367 
01:46:36,128 --> 01:46:38,797 
GI! GI... 

1368 
01:46:44,469 --> 01:46:45,762 
Motherfucker. 

1369 
01:46:46,888 --> 01:46:48,432 
Hey, soldier. 

1370 
01:46:52,894 --> 01:46:54,771 
Do you know who's 
in command here? 

1371 
01:47:12,956 --> 01:47:15,459 
Holy shit. 

1372 
01:47:20,088 --> 01:47:23,049 
Hey, Chief, man. Two guys 
just got blown off that bridge. 

1373 
01:47:23,175 --> 01:47:25,969 
You hang on, man. 
You're gonna be okay. 

1374 
01:47:30,015 --> 01:47:31,850 
- What's that? 
- Mail, man. Mail. 

1375 
01:47:31,975 --> 01:47:34,478 
Later on the mail. 
Watch them trees. 

1376 
01:47:36,730 --> 01:47:39,483 
There's no diesel fuel, 
but I picked up some ammo. 

1377 
01:47:39,608 --> 01:47:41,234 
Let's move out. 

1378 
01:47:41,359 --> 01:47:45,113 
- Did you find the CO, Captain? 
- There's no fucking CO here. 

1379 
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:49,451 
Let's just get goin'. 

1380 
01:47:49,534 --> 01:47:51,453 
Which way, Captain? 

1381 
01:47:57,125 --> 01:47:59,878 
You know which way, Chief. 

1382 
01:48:00,003 --> 01:48:02,714 
You're on your own, Captain. 

1383 
01:48:02,839 --> 01:48:04,216 
Still wanna go on? 

1384 
01:48:04,341 --> 01:48:05,926 
It's like this bridge. 

1385 
01:48:06,051 --> 01:48:09,137 
We build it every night, Charlie 
blows it right back up again... 

1386 
01:48:09,262 --> 01:48:11,765 
just so the generals 
can say the road's open. 

1387 
01:48:11,890 --> 01:48:13,600 
Think about it. 

1388 
01:48:17,104 --> 01:48:19,856 
- Who cares? 
- Just get us upriver! 

1389 
01:48:24,152 --> 01:48:26,405 
Chef, on the bow. 

1390 
01:48:27,656 --> 01:48:29,783 
- Stand by, Clean. 
- Let's go! 

1391 
01:49:21,793 --> 01:49:26,089 
You got one, Miller. 
Jeez, I got some too. 

1392 
01:49:26,214 --> 01:49:27,758 
Whose package is that? 

1393 
01:49:27,883 --> 01:49:31,178 
- Shit, you got another one, Clean. 
- No shit? Wait a minute. 

1394 
01:49:31,303 --> 01:49:33,930 
- Is that it? 
- That's it for you. Lance. 

1395 
01:49:34,765 --> 01:49:38,518 
Mr. L.B. Johnson, 
there you go. 

1396 
01:49:38,643 --> 01:49:42,105 
Far out, man. All right. 
I've been waitin' for this one. 

1397 
01:49:42,230 --> 01:49:45,525 
I got another one. 
I got a box from Eva. 

1398 
01:49:45,650 --> 01:49:48,028 
"Lance. 
I'm fine. I'm fine. 

1399 
01:49:48,153 --> 01:49:51,698 
Sue and I went tripping in Disneyland. 
Sue skinned her knee." 

1400 
01:49:51,823 --> 01:49:54,201 
Man, I wanna get back 
to Antoine's. 

1401 
01:49:54,326 --> 01:49:58,580 
"I remember the time we went up to..." 
How could I fucking forget? Beautiful. 

1402 
01:49:58,705 --> 01:50:01,458 
"There could never be a place 
like Disneyland, or could there? 

1403 
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:02,709 
Let me know." 

1404 
01:50:02,834 --> 01:50:06,171 
Jim, it's here. 
It really is here. 

1405 
01:50:10,717 --> 01:50:13,261 
<i>"There has been a new development 
regarding your mission... </i> 

1406 
01:50:13,386 --> 01:50:15,722 
<i>which we must now 
communicate to you. </i> 

1407 
01:50:15,847 --> 01:50:19,267 
<i>Months ago, a man was ordered on 
a mission which was identical to yours. </i> 

1408 
01:50:20,143 --> 01:50:23,814 
<i>We have reason to believe that he 
is now operating with Col. Kurtz. </i> 

1409 
01:50:25,524 --> 01:50:28,985 
<i>Saigon was carrying him MIA 
for his family's sake... </i> 

1410 
01:50:29,111 --> 01:50:31,530 
<i>but they assumed he was dead. </i> 

1411 
01:50:31,655 --> 01:50:35,659 
<i>Then they intercepted a letter 
he tried to send to his wife. "</i> 

1412 
01:50:39,079 --> 01:50:40,997 
<i>Captain Richard Colby. </i> 

1413 
01:50:43,166 --> 01:50:45,585 
<i>He was with Kurtz. </i> 

1414 
01:50:45,710 --> 01:50:48,171 
Disneyland. 

1415 
01:50:48,296 --> 01:50:50,841 
Fuck, man, this is better 
than Disneyland. 

1416 
01:50:50,966 --> 01:50:55,387 
"Charles Miller Manson ordered 
the slaughter of all in the home... 

1417 
01:50:55,512 --> 01:50:57,514 
anyway as a symbol of protest." 

1418 
01:50:57,639 --> 01:51:00,058 
That's really weird, 
ain't it? 

1419 
01:51:00,183 --> 01:51:03,395 
- Purple haze. Look, man. 
- Hey, Lance, put away that smoke. 

1420 
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:06,773 
- I got a tape from my mom. 
- Rainbow reality, man. 

1421 
01:51:06,898 --> 01:51:10,235 
Hey, Chief, 
get a good whiff. 

1422 
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:13,113 
Eva can't picture me 
in Vietnam. 

1423 
01:51:13,238 --> 01:51:16,575 
She pictures me at home 
having a beer watching TV. 

1424 
01:51:18,034 --> 01:51:19,286 
Hey, Lance, man. 

1425 
01:51:19,411 --> 01:51:21,747 
Oh, hot potato, 
hot potato. 

1426 
01:51:21,872 --> 01:51:24,708 
<i>I'm so glad you decided 
to join the navy. </i> 

1427 
01:51:24,833 --> 01:51:28,128 
Eva's not sure she can have 
a relationship with me, you know. 

1428 
01:51:28,253 --> 01:51:30,964 
Here I am, 
13,000 fucking miles away... 

1429 
01:51:31,089 --> 01:51:34,176 
trying to keep a relationship 
with my ass. 

1430 
01:51:34,301 --> 01:51:38,013 
<i>That's much more than I can say 
for some of your friends. </i> 

1431 
01:51:38,138 --> 01:51:40,140 
<i>If this tape is any good... </i> 

1432 
01:51:40,265 --> 01:51:44,394 
<i>I will have Dad and the family 
send you a tape of their own. </i> 

1433 
01:51:56,823 --> 01:51:58,200 
Fuckers! 

1434 
01:52:03,622 --> 01:52:05,749 
There! Over there! 

1435 
01:52:07,626 --> 01:52:09,503 
Motherfuckers! 

1436 
01:52:20,222 --> 01:52:22,099 
There. Over there! 

1437 
01:52:31,358 --> 01:52:35,404 
Chef, check out Clean! 
Captain, he's hit. Clean's hit. 

1438 
01:52:35,529 --> 01:52:37,823 
Where'd the dog go? 

1439 
01:52:37,948 --> 01:52:41,034 
Lance! Lance! 
They got Clean. 

1440 
01:52:41,159 --> 01:52:44,746 
Where's the dog? 
We gotta go back and get the dog. 

1441 
01:52:44,871 --> 01:52:48,041 
Hey, Clean. Hey. 

1442 
01:52:48,166 --> 01:52:50,502 
Hey, bubba. 

1443 
01:52:50,627 --> 01:52:52,629 
Bubba, you can't die, 
you fucker! 

1444 
01:52:54,506 --> 01:52:56,049 
Hey, bubba. 

1445 
01:52:56,174 --> 01:53:01,471 
<i>And so I'm hoping that... 
pretty soon... not too soon... </i> 

1446 
01:53:01,596 --> 01:53:06,017 
<i>but pretty soon I'll have a lot 
of grandchildren to love and spoil. </i> 

1447 
01:53:06,143 --> 01:53:09,813 
<i>And then when your wife get 'em back, 
she'll be mad with me. </i> 

1448 
01:53:12,023 --> 01:53:14,359 
<i>Even Aunt Jessie and Mama... </i> 

1449 
01:53:14,484 --> 01:53:17,738 
<i>will come to celebrate 
your coming home. </i> 

1450 
01:53:17,863 --> 01:53:21,408 
<i>Granny and Dad are trying to get 
enough money to get you a car... </i> 

1451 
01:53:21,533 --> 01:53:26,079 
<i>but don't tell 'em 
because that's our secret. </i> 

1452 
01:53:26,204 --> 01:53:28,915 
<i>Anyhow, do the right thing... </i> 

1453 
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,418 
<i>stay out of the way 
of the bullets... </i> 

1454 
01:53:31,543 --> 01:53:35,589 
<i>and bring your heinie home 
all in one piece... </i> 

1455 
01:53:35,714 --> 01:53:37,966 
<i>because we love you 
very much. </i> 

1456 
01:53:38,091 --> 01:53:40,010 
<i>Love, Mom. </i> 

1457 
01:55:13,937 --> 01:55:15,605 
Hold on. 

1458 
01:55:17,983 --> 01:55:19,860 
Throw me the glasses. 

1459 
01:55:32,122 --> 01:55:34,791 
Lance, take a 16 on the bow. 

1460 
01:55:37,502 --> 01:55:41,131 
Chef. Chef. 
On the 60. 

1461 
01:56:03,361 --> 01:56:04,404 
Fuck me. 

1462 
01:57:13,432 --> 01:57:15,892 
Cover the captain. Lance. 

1463 
01:57:16,017 --> 01:57:17,894 
Cover the captain. 

1464 
01:57:35,203 --> 01:57:36,830 
They're French. 
They're French. 

1465 
01:57:39,291 --> 01:57:42,002 
Pick up that weapon! 
Pick it up! Pick it up! 

1466 
01:57:42,127 --> 01:57:43,712 
Stand fast. Captain. 

1467 
01:58:18,497 --> 01:58:21,083 
All right, you men. 
Put down your weapons. 

1468 
01:59:16,012 --> 01:59:17,889 
We lost one of our men. 

1469 
01:59:21,643 --> 01:59:25,731 
We French always pay respect 
to the dead of our allies. 

1470 
01:59:28,608 --> 01:59:30,527 
You're all welcome. 

1471 
01:59:33,155 --> 01:59:35,157 
My name is Hubert DeMarais. 

1472 
01:59:36,783 --> 01:59:39,619 
This is my family's plantation. 

1473 
01:59:39,745 --> 01:59:42,831 
It has been such 
for 70 years. 

1474 
01:59:43,915 --> 01:59:47,252 
And it will be such 
until we are all dead. 

1475 
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:02,262 
Captain, accept the flag 
of Tyrone Miller... 

1476 
02:02:02,387 --> 02:02:04,890 
on behalf of 
a grateful nation. 

1477 
02:02:25,035 --> 02:02:27,871 
This food is really wonderful, 
isn't it? The wine, the sauces. 

1478 
02:02:27,996 --> 02:02:31,500 
I can't believe it. 
Hey, can I speak with the chef? 

1479 
02:02:31,625 --> 02:02:33,835 
The chef speak 
only Vietnamese. 

1480 
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:37,714 
No kidding? He cooks like this 
and he can't even speak French? 

1481 
02:02:37,839 --> 02:02:40,884 
Hey, Lance, 
the chef's a slope. 

1482 
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:16,878 
This is Baudelaire. 
It's a very cruel poem for children. 

1483 
02:03:17,003 --> 02:03:20,882 
But they need it, 'cause 
life sometimes is very cruel. 

1484 
02:03:21,967 --> 02:03:23,885 
As you can see. 

1485 
02:03:27,639 --> 02:03:29,725 
Attack repels by the family. 

1486 
02:03:29,850 --> 02:03:31,852 
Just for this war. 

1487 
02:03:31,977 --> 02:03:36,398 
Vietcong, 58. 
North Vietnamese, 12. 

1488 
02:03:36,523 --> 02:03:39,651 
South Vietnamese, 11. 

1489 
02:03:39,776 --> 02:03:41,695 
Americans, six? 

1490 
02:03:43,029 --> 02:03:46,408 
Yes. Well, there were 
perhaps mistakes. 

1491 
02:04:07,304 --> 02:04:09,931 
May I present Captain Willard. 
He is of a paratroop regiment. 

1492 
02:04:10,057 --> 02:04:12,225 
Madame Sarrault. 

1493 
02:04:12,350 --> 02:04:13,727 
Captain. 

1494 
02:04:40,420 --> 02:04:42,631 
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain. 
It was just a little story... 

1495 
02:04:42,756 --> 02:04:45,092 
about Paris and people 
starving during the war. 

1496 
02:04:45,217 --> 02:04:47,928 
They are all around the table, and 
there was a silence and somebody say... 

1497 
02:04:48,053 --> 02:04:50,055 
"An angel is passing by." 

1498 
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:53,433 
So somebody said, 
"Let's eat it." 

1499 
02:04:53,558 --> 02:04:54,851 
Oh. 

1500 
02:05:00,482 --> 02:05:04,194 
How long can you 
possibly stay here? 

1501 
02:05:04,319 --> 02:05:06,947 
We stay forever. 

1502 
02:05:07,072 --> 02:05:08,949 
No, no. I mean... 

1503 
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:12,202 
why don't you go 
back home to France? 

1504 
02:05:13,245 --> 02:05:17,165 
- Back home? 
- I mean, this is our home, Captain. 

1505 
02:05:17,290 --> 02:05:18,875 
Sooner or later, you're... 

1506 
02:05:21,711 --> 02:05:23,797 
You don't understand 
our mentality... 

1507 
02:05:23,922 --> 02:05:26,299 
the French officer mentality! 

1508 
02:05:26,425 --> 02:05:28,635 
At first, we lose 
in Second World War. 

1509 
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:31,805 
I don't say that you 
Americans win, but we lose. 

1510 
02:05:31,930 --> 02:05:32,931 
Oh, Papa... 

1511 
02:05:34,057 --> 02:05:36,852 
In Dien Bien Phu, we lose. 
In Algeria, we lose. 

1512 
02:05:36,977 --> 02:05:39,354 
In Indochina, we lose! 

1513 
02:05:39,479 --> 02:05:42,190 
But here we don't lose! 

1514 
02:05:42,315 --> 02:05:45,318 
This piece of earth, 
we keep it. 

1515 
02:05:45,444 --> 02:05:47,320 
We will never lose it. 
Never! 

1516 
02:05:53,118 --> 02:05:54,953 
You Americans. 

1517 
02:05:56,413 --> 02:06:00,834 
In 1945, yeah... 

1518 
02:06:00,959 --> 02:06:05,464 
after the Japanese war, 
your President Roosevelt... 

1519 
02:06:05,589 --> 02:06:08,800 
didn't want the French people 
to stay in Indochina. 

1520 
02:06:10,469 --> 02:06:12,429 
So... 

1521 
02:06:12,512 --> 02:06:15,474 
you Americans implant 
the Vietminh. 

1522 
02:06:17,184 --> 02:06:18,435 
What's he mean? 

1523 
02:06:18,518 --> 02:06:21,938 
Yeah, that's true. The Vietcong 
were invented by the Americans. 

1524 
02:06:23,106 --> 02:06:24,316 
The Americans? 

1525 
02:06:25,192 --> 02:06:27,694 
And now you take 
the French place... 

1526 
02:06:27,819 --> 02:06:29,946 
and the Vietminh fight you. 

1527 
02:06:30,072 --> 02:06:31,948 
And what can you do? 

1528 
02:06:32,074 --> 02:06:34,367 
Nothing. 
Absolutely nothing. 

1529 
02:06:34,493 --> 02:06:38,038 
The Vietnamese are very intelligent. 
You never know what they think. 

1530 
02:06:38,163 --> 02:06:41,875 
The Russian ones who help them, 
"Come and give us their money. 

1531 
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,837 
We are all Communists. Chinese, 
give us guns. We are all brothers." 

1532 
02:06:45,962 --> 02:06:47,881 
They hate the Chinese! 

1533 
02:06:48,006 --> 02:06:52,844 
Maybe they hate the American 
less than the Russian and the Chinese. 

1534 
02:06:52,969 --> 02:06:55,180 
I mean, if tomorrow 
the Vietnamese are Communists... 

1535 
02:06:55,305 --> 02:06:57,182 
they will be Vietnamese Communists. 

1536 
02:06:57,307 --> 02:06:59,893 
And this is something that you 
never understood, you American. 

1537 
02:07:00,018 --> 02:07:01,895 
I don't know. 

1538 
02:07:02,020 --> 02:07:05,482 
Maybe in the future we can make 
something with the Vietminh. 

1539 
02:07:05,607 --> 02:07:07,734 
Don't you understand? 

1540 
02:07:07,859 --> 02:07:10,612 
The VC say, 
"Go away. Go away." 

1541 
02:07:10,737 --> 02:07:13,240 
That's finish for all 
the white people in Indochina. 

1542 
02:07:13,365 --> 02:07:16,618 
If you're French, American, 
that's all the same. 

1543 
02:07:16,743 --> 02:07:20,330 
"Go." They want to forget you. 
Look, Captain. 

1544 
02:07:22,707 --> 02:07:25,752 
Look, this is the truth. 
An egg. 

1545 
02:07:28,213 --> 02:07:29,423 
The white left... 

1546 
02:07:31,216 --> 02:07:34,302 
but the yellow stays! 

1547 
02:07:41,476 --> 02:07:45,313 
When I was in Saigon, 
I spoke to an American politician. 

1548 
02:07:45,439 --> 02:07:48,442 
He explained it very well. 
He said, "Look. 

1549 
02:07:48,567 --> 02:07:51,695 
Yesterday, it was Korea. 
Today, Vietnam. 

1550 
02:07:51,820 --> 02:07:54,406 
Tomorrow, Thailand, 
the Philippines... 

1551 
02:07:54,531 --> 02:07:57,159 
then maybe Europe." 

1552 
02:07:57,284 --> 02:08:00,328 
Come on. Why not Europe? 

1553 
02:08:00,454 --> 02:08:02,748 
Look what happened 
in Czechoslovakia recently. 

1554 
02:08:02,873 --> 02:08:06,460 
Even before Second World War Americans 
knew exactly what was going on. 

1555 
02:08:06,585 --> 02:08:10,213 
They don't want 
that shit to take over! LeFevre! 

1556 
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:13,967 
All you white people are shit. 

1557 
02:08:14,092 --> 02:08:16,553 
They are fighting... 
fighting for freedom. 

1558 
02:08:16,678 --> 02:08:18,930 
Freedom? Bullshit. 

1559 
02:08:19,056 --> 02:08:21,850 
French bullshit. 
American bullshit. 

1560 
02:08:21,975 --> 02:08:24,311 
Dien Bien Phu, 
that serious. 

1561 
02:08:24,436 --> 02:08:28,315 
All soldiers know 
they are already dead. 

1562 
02:08:29,524 --> 02:08:31,610 
You know anything 
about Dien Bien Phu? 

1563 
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:36,698 
- Yeah, I know. 
- No, you don't. 

1564 
02:08:37,949 --> 02:08:40,660 
- Not really. 
- Dien Bien Phu was an error. 

1565 
02:08:40,786 --> 02:08:42,037 
A military mistake. 

1566 
02:08:42,162 --> 02:08:44,498 
A mistake? 
A voluntary mistake! 

1567 
02:08:44,623 --> 02:08:46,249 
Voluntary! 

1568 
02:08:48,335 --> 02:08:52,214 
All the soldiers knew. 
We knew we would be dead. 

1569 
02:08:52,339 --> 02:08:55,467 
The generals and the colonels believe 
it's impossible for the Viets... 

1570 
02:08:55,592 --> 02:08:58,261 
to get the cannon 
up there in the mountains. 

1571 
02:08:58,387 --> 02:09:02,599 
But they do. Then they wait 
for the rain to come. 

1572 
02:09:04,142 --> 02:09:08,814 
When it comes, 
no aeroplane can fly there. 

1573 
02:09:08,939 --> 02:09:11,233 
And our paratroopers 
jump at 90 meters. 

1574 
02:09:11,358 --> 02:09:14,444 
I mean, you know, 
90 meters... 70 meters. 

1575 
02:09:14,569 --> 02:09:17,197 
I mean, that's crazy. 
No army in the world can do that. 

1576 
02:09:17,322 --> 02:09:21,034 
And they only do that 
to be dead with their friends. 

1577 
02:09:27,791 --> 02:09:29,960 
The French Army was sacrificed. 

1578 
02:09:30,085 --> 02:09:32,546 
Sacrificed by the politicians 
safe at home. 

1579 
02:09:32,671 --> 02:09:35,465 
They put the army in an impossible 
situation where they couldn't win. 

1580 
02:09:35,590 --> 02:09:38,301 
The students are 
marching in Paris... 

1581 
02:09:38,427 --> 02:09:40,303 
protesting, demonstrating. 

1582 
02:09:40,429 --> 02:09:42,681 
They stab the soldiers 
in their back. 

1583 
02:09:42,806 --> 02:09:46,518 
The soldier would open 
the grenade, it wouldn't work. 

1584 
02:09:46,643 --> 02:09:50,731 
A piece of paper would fall... 

1585 
02:09:50,856 --> 02:09:54,025 
"Union of French Women." 
"We are for the Viets." 

1586 
02:09:54,151 --> 02:09:57,821 
Traitors! 
Communist traitors at home. 

1587 
02:09:59,698 --> 02:10:02,242 
Dien Bien Phu, okay. 

1588 
02:10:02,367 --> 02:10:06,246 
The French is shit, huh? 

1589 
02:10:06,371 --> 02:10:08,623 
No one care. 
No one want... 

1590 
02:10:11,251 --> 02:10:14,463 
Why don't you Americans 
learn from us, from our mistakes? 

1591 
02:10:14,546 --> 02:10:16,465 
<i>Mon Dieux,  with your army, 
your strength...</i> 

1592 
02:10:16,548 --> 02:10:18,842 
your power, you could win 
if you want to! 

1593 
02:10:21,261 --> 02:10:23,513 
You can win. 

1594 
02:10:26,892 --> 02:10:30,270 
You know, I'm sure 
we can make something here. 

1595 
02:10:30,395 --> 02:10:32,272 
I'm sure about it, 
you know? 

1596 
02:10:32,397 --> 02:10:35,817 
I never do something wrong 
to the people here. 

1597 
02:10:35,942 --> 02:10:38,487 
That's right, but the Communist 
at home have never been traitors. 

1598 
02:11:04,096 --> 02:11:06,765 
- Communist! 
- Socialist! 

1599 
02:11:14,940 --> 02:11:18,360 
<i>Capitaine,  good night. 
He was a Socialist, you know.</i> 

1600 
02:11:18,485 --> 02:11:22,614 
We can stay. I know 
that we can stay. We can. 

1601 
02:11:26,159 --> 02:11:29,538 
You know, we always 
helped the people. 

1602 
02:11:29,663 --> 02:11:31,581 
We work with the people. 

1603 
02:11:32,666 --> 02:11:35,919 
So we can be friends, 
we are agreed. 

1604 
02:11:47,973 --> 02:11:51,893 
See, Captain, 
when my grandfather... 

1605 
02:11:53,645 --> 02:11:56,565 
and my uncle's father 
came here... 

1606 
02:11:58,525 --> 02:12:01,153 
there was nothing... 
nothing. 

1607 
02:12:02,279 --> 02:12:04,948 
The Vietnamese were nothing. 

1608 
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:09,035 
So we worked hard... 

1609 
02:12:09,161 --> 02:12:11,079 
very hard, and brought... 

1610 
02:12:11,204 --> 02:12:14,791 
the rubber from Brazil, 
and then plant it here. 

1611 
02:12:16,001 --> 02:12:19,129 
We took the Vietnamese, 
work with them... 

1612 
02:12:20,005 --> 02:12:21,882 
make something... 

1613 
02:12:22,007 --> 02:12:24,718 
something out of nothing. 

1614 
02:12:24,843 --> 02:12:29,264 
So when you ask me why 
we want to stay here, Captain... 

1615 
02:12:30,849 --> 02:12:34,936 
we want to stay here because 
it's ours... it belongs to us. 

1616 
02:12:35,062 --> 02:12:36,980 
It keeps our family together. 

1617 
02:12:38,857 --> 02:12:40,776 
I mean, we fight for that. 

1618 
02:12:42,861 --> 02:12:47,199 
While you Americans, 
you are fighting for... 

1619 
02:12:47,324 --> 02:12:51,286 
the biggest nothing in history. 

1620 
02:12:58,502 --> 02:13:03,340 
I'm sorry, Captain. I will see 
if your men need any help to... 

1621 
02:13:03,465 --> 02:13:05,550 
repair your boat... 

1622 
02:13:05,675 --> 02:13:08,678 
so that you can go on 
with your war. 

1623 
02:13:44,381 --> 02:13:47,259 
I apologize 
for my family, Captain. 

1624 
02:13:48,844 --> 02:13:51,138 
We have all lost much here. 

1625 
02:13:52,389 --> 02:13:55,183 
Hubert... his wife 
and two sons. 

1626 
02:14:00,063 --> 02:14:02,274 
And I have lost a husband. 

1627 
02:14:08,113 --> 02:14:09,865 
I understand. 

1628 
02:14:09,990 --> 02:14:12,534 
You are tired of the war. 

1629 
02:14:14,202 --> 02:14:16,747 
I can see it in your face. 

1630 
02:14:18,790 --> 02:14:22,836 
'Twas the same in the eyes 
of the soldiers of our war. 

1631 
02:14:24,296 --> 02:14:28,008 
<i>We called them 
"Les Soldats Perdus..."</i> 

1632 
02:14:28,133 --> 02:14:30,343 
The Lost Soldiers. 

1633 
02:14:35,057 --> 02:14:37,601 
If you like, 
we can have some cognac. 

1634 
02:14:44,775 --> 02:14:47,861 
I have to... 
to see about my men and... 

1635 
02:14:55,118 --> 02:14:57,996 
The war will be 
still here tomorrow. 

1636 
02:15:08,256 --> 02:15:10,467 
Yeah, I guess you're right. 

1637 
02:15:18,517 --> 02:15:21,269 
I noticed you had 
no wine at dinner. 

1638 
02:15:22,354 --> 02:15:25,482 
No, I don't drink wine. 

1639 
02:15:28,527 --> 02:15:32,614 
I do like cognac, but I don't want 
any now. Thank you. 

1640 
02:15:33,907 --> 02:15:36,326 
Well... 

1641 
02:15:36,451 --> 02:15:39,496 
then I... 
I must drink alone. 

1642 
02:15:49,756 --> 02:15:52,968 
Will you go back 
after the war to America? 

1643 
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:02,102 
Then you're like us... 
your home is here. 

1644 
02:16:19,536 --> 02:16:23,415 
Do you know why you can never step 
into the same river twice? 

1645 
02:16:25,667 --> 02:16:29,212 
Yeah. 'Cause it's always moving. 

1646 
02:16:30,380 --> 02:16:34,217 
I used to prepare 
a pipe for my husband. 

1647 
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:44,936 
'Twas the morphine he took for 
the wounds he suffered in his heart. 

1648 
02:16:48,273 --> 02:16:52,444 
He would rage and he would cry, 
my lost soldier. 

1649 
02:16:56,114 --> 02:17:00,035 
And I said to him, 
"There are two of you. 

1650 
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:02,788 
Don't you see? 

1651 
02:17:02,913 --> 02:17:06,792 
One that kills 
and one that loves." 

1652 
02:17:08,752 --> 02:17:10,921 
And he said to me... 

1653 
02:17:11,046 --> 02:17:15,759 
"I don't know whether 
I'm an animal or a god." 

1654 
02:17:18,303 --> 02:17:20,180 
But you are both. 

1655 
02:18:02,180 --> 02:18:04,057 
You want more? 

1656 
02:18:09,479 --> 02:18:13,191 
All that matters 
is that you're alive. 

1657 
02:18:14,901 --> 02:18:17,654 
You are alive, Captain. 

1658 
02:18:21,241 --> 02:18:23,493 
That's the truth. 

1659 
02:19:36,608 --> 02:19:39,403 
There are two of you, 
don't you see? 

1660 
02:19:41,446 --> 02:19:43,949 
One that kills... 

1661 
02:19:44,074 --> 02:19:46,410 
and one that loves. 

1662 
02:20:14,980 --> 02:20:17,858 
Can't see nothing. 
We stoppin'. 

1663 
02:20:17,983 --> 02:20:20,527 
You're not authorized 
to stop this boat, Chief. 

1664 
02:20:20,652 --> 02:20:24,114 
I said I can't see a thing, Captain. 
I'm stopping this boat. 

1665 
02:20:24,239 --> 02:20:26,116 
I ain't riskin' 
no more lives. 

1666 
02:20:26,241 --> 02:20:28,952 
I'm in command here, goddam it. 
You'll do what I say. 

1667 
02:20:30,746 --> 02:20:32,622 
You see anything, Chef? 

1668 
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,753 
Why don't they 
fucking attack, man? 

1669 
02:20:56,271 --> 02:20:58,398 
Watch it over here, Chief. 

1670 
02:20:59,357 --> 02:21:01,318 
Got a stump. 

1671 
02:21:04,196 --> 02:21:05,906 
On the fifties. 

1672 
02:21:06,031 --> 02:21:08,408 
<i>He was close. </i> 

1673 
02:21:09,868 --> 02:21:11,995 
<i>He was real close. </i> 

1674 
02:21:13,121 --> 02:21:16,583 
<i>I couldn't see him yet, 
but I could feel him... </i> 

1675 
02:21:16,708 --> 02:21:18,627 
<i>as if the boat were being 
sucked upriver... </i> 

1676 
02:21:18,752 --> 02:21:21,588 
<i>and the water was 
flowing back into the jungle. </i> 

1677 
02:21:24,132 --> 02:21:26,009 
<i>Whatever was going to happen... </i> 

1678 
02:21:26,134 --> 02:21:30,013 
<i>it wasn't going to be the way 
they called it back in Nha Trang. </i> 

1679 
02:21:35,143 --> 02:21:37,521 
- Arrows! 
- Fire! 

1680 
02:21:39,856 --> 02:21:42,692 
Chef, open up! Fire! 

1681 
02:21:45,904 --> 02:21:48,198 
Lance, fire! 

1682 
02:21:55,914 --> 02:21:59,876 
Chef! Chef, it's okay. 
Quit firing. 

1683 
02:22:00,001 --> 02:22:03,630 
- They're just little toy arrows. 
- Cut it out! Quiet! 

1684 
02:22:03,755 --> 02:22:06,717 
Chief, tell them 
to hold their fire! 

1685 
02:22:06,842 --> 02:22:09,386 
They're just little sticks. 
They're just trying to scare us. 

1686 
02:22:09,511 --> 02:22:11,471 
Quiet! 

1687 
02:22:11,596 --> 02:22:14,474 
You got us into this mess, 
and now you can't get us out... 

1688 
02:22:14,599 --> 02:22:17,060 
because you don't know where 
the hell you're going, do ya? 

1689 
02:22:17,185 --> 02:22:19,312 
Do ya? 

1690 
02:22:19,438 --> 02:22:22,566 
You son of a bitch! 
You bastard! 

1691 
02:22:24,109 --> 02:22:26,361 
Lance, get the wheel! 

1692 
02:22:26,486 --> 02:22:30,741 
You savages! Come and get it! 
You son of a bitches! 

1693 
02:22:51,011 --> 02:22:52,596 
A spear? 

1694 
02:24:12,134 --> 02:24:15,262 
My mission is to make it 
up into Cambodia. 

1695 
02:24:15,387 --> 02:24:18,306 
There's a Green Beret colonel 
up there who's gone insane... 

1696 
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:19,850 
and I'm supposed to kill him. 

1697 
02:24:21,309 --> 02:24:24,229 
That's fucking typical! 
Shit! 

1698 
02:24:24,354 --> 02:24:26,606 
Fuckin' Vietnam mission! 

1699 
02:24:26,732 --> 02:24:30,402 
I'm short and we gotta go up there 
so you can kill one of our own guys? 

1700 
02:24:30,527 --> 02:24:34,197 
That's fucking great! 
That's just fucking great, man. 

1701 
02:24:34,322 --> 02:24:38,493 
Shit! 
That's fuckin' crazy. 

1702 
02:24:38,577 --> 02:24:41,538 
I mean, I thought you were 
going in to blow up a bridge... 

1703 
02:24:41,663 --> 02:24:44,958 
or some fuckin' 
railroad tracks or somethin'. 

1704 
02:24:45,083 --> 02:24:47,502 
- That's all right. 
- No. No, wait. Wait. 

1705 
02:24:47,627 --> 02:24:50,964 
We'll go together, on the boat. 
We'll go with you. 

1706 
02:24:51,089 --> 02:24:55,510 
We'll go up there, 
but on the boat. Okay? 

1707 
02:26:01,576 --> 02:26:04,037 
<i>Part of me was afraid 
of what I would find... </i> 

1708 
02:26:04,162 --> 02:26:06,581 
<i>and what I would do 
when I got there. </i> 

1709 
02:26:08,542 --> 02:26:11,378 
<i>I knew the risks... </i> 

1710 
02:26:11,503 --> 02:26:13,797 
<i>or imagined I knew. </i> 

1711 
02:26:15,716 --> 02:26:18,260 
<i>But the thing 
I felt the most... </i> 

1712 
02:26:18,385 --> 02:26:21,471 
<i>much stronger than fear... </i> 

1713 
02:26:21,596 --> 02:26:24,307 
<i>was the desire to confront him. </i> 

1714 
02:27:36,129 --> 02:27:38,173 
Just keep movin'. 

1715 
02:27:38,298 --> 02:27:42,427 
Lance, keep your hands 
away from the guns. 

1716 
02:29:09,222 --> 02:29:11,808 
It's all right! It's all right! 
It's all been approved! 

1717 
02:29:13,185 --> 02:29:16,229 
I ain't comin' in there! 
Them bastards attacked us! 

1718 
02:29:16,354 --> 02:29:20,817 
Hey, zap 'em with your siren, man. 
Zap 'em with your siren. 

1719 
02:29:31,036 --> 02:29:33,288 
There's mines over there 
and mines over there too. 

1720 
02:29:33,413 --> 02:29:36,583 
And watch out. Those goddam 
monkeys will bite you, I'll tell you. 

1721 
02:29:36,708 --> 02:29:39,920 
Ah, that's a pretty one. 
Move it right in towards me. 

1722 
02:29:40,045 --> 02:29:41,755 
I'm an American. 

1723 
02:29:41,880 --> 02:29:44,674 
Yeah. An American civilian. 
Hi, Yanks. 

1724 
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:47,260 
Hi. American. 

1725 
02:29:47,386 --> 02:29:49,471 
American civilian. 
It's all right. 

1726 
02:29:49,596 --> 02:29:53,475 
And you got the cigarettes. And that's 
what I've been dreaming about. 

1727 
02:29:55,477 --> 02:29:58,230 
- Who are you? 
- Who are you? 

1728 
02:30:02,275 --> 02:30:03,902 
I'm a photojournalist. 

1729 
02:30:04,027 --> 02:30:06,696 
I've covered the war 
since '64. 

1730 
02:30:06,822 --> 02:30:09,366 
I've been in Laos, 
Cambodia and 'Nam. 

1731 
02:30:12,744 --> 02:30:16,832 
Hoo-wee, baby. I'll tell you one thing. 
This boat is a mess, man. 

1732 
02:30:16,957 --> 02:30:19,209 
Who are all these people? 

1733 
02:30:19,334 --> 02:30:23,130 
Yeah, well, they think 
you've come to... 

1734 
02:30:23,255 --> 02:30:24,548 
to take him away. 

1735 
02:30:24,673 --> 02:30:27,843 
- And I hope that isn't true. 
- Take who away? 

1736 
02:30:30,011 --> 02:30:33,306 
Him! Col. Kurtz. 

1737 
02:30:33,432 --> 02:30:37,144 
These are all his children, 
man, as far as you can see. 

1738 
02:30:37,269 --> 02:30:40,981 
Hell, man, out here 
we're all his children. 

1739 
02:30:41,106 --> 02:30:44,735 
Could we talk to Col. Kurtz? 

1740 
02:30:44,860 --> 02:30:49,072 
Hey, Mac. 
You don't talk to the colonel. 

1741 
02:30:49,197 --> 02:30:51,074 
Well, you listen to him. 

1742 
02:30:51,199 --> 02:30:54,453 
The man's enlarged my mind. 

1743 
02:30:54,578 --> 02:30:58,248 
He's a poet warrior 
in the classic sense. 

1744 
02:30:58,373 --> 02:31:00,250 
I mean, sometimes he'll... 

1745 
02:31:00,375 --> 02:31:01,960 
Well, you say hello to him, 
right? 

1746 
02:31:02,085 --> 02:31:04,463 
He'll just walk by you 
and he won't even notice you. 

1747 
02:31:04,588 --> 02:31:08,175 
Then suddenly he'll grab you and he'll 
throw you in a corner and he'll say... 

1748 
02:31:08,300 --> 02:31:10,302 
"Do you know that 'if' 
is the middle word in 'life'? 

1749 
02:31:10,427 --> 02:31:13,305 
If you can keep your head when all about 
you are losing theirs and blaming you. 

1750 
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:15,724 
If you can trust yourself 
when all men doubt you." 

1751 
02:31:15,849 --> 02:31:18,935 
I'm a little man. I'm a little man. 
He's a great man. 

1752 
02:31:19,061 --> 02:31:22,189 
"I should have been 
a pair of ragged claws... 

1753 
02:31:22,314 --> 02:31:25,150 
scuttling across floors 
of silent seas." 

1754 
02:31:25,275 --> 02:31:27,486 
- I mean... 
- Stay with the boat. 

1755 
02:31:27,611 --> 02:31:32,032 
Don't go any... Don't go without me, 
okay? I wanna get a picture. 

1756 
02:31:33,825 --> 02:31:37,162 
He can be terrible 
and he can be mean... 

1757 
02:31:37,287 --> 02:31:39,164 
and he can be right. 

1758 
02:31:39,289 --> 02:31:42,292 
He's fighting the war. 
He's a great man. 

1759 
02:31:45,712 --> 02:31:47,631 
I mean... 

1760 
02:31:50,175 --> 02:31:53,678 
I wish I had words, you know. 
I wish I had words. 

1761 
02:31:53,804 --> 02:31:56,807 
I could tell you something like, 
the other day he wanted to kill me. 

1762 
02:31:56,932 --> 02:31:59,643 
- Something like that. 
- Why'd he want to kill you? 

1763 
02:31:59,768 --> 02:32:02,145 
Because I took his picture. 

1764 
02:32:02,270 --> 02:32:05,816 
He said, "If you take 
my picture again... 

1765 
02:32:05,941 --> 02:32:08,485 
I'm gonna kill you." 

1766 
02:32:08,568 --> 02:32:10,487 
And he meant it. 

1767 
02:32:12,197 --> 02:32:14,866 
See, just lay cool. 
Lay cool. 

1768 
02:32:14,991 --> 02:32:16,910 
Lay back. Dig it. 

1769 
02:32:17,035 --> 02:32:19,913 
He gets friendly again. 
He really does. 

1770 
02:32:20,038 --> 02:32:23,333 
But you don't... you don't... 
you don't judge the colonel. 

1771 
02:32:23,458 --> 02:32:26,128 
You don't judge the colonel 
like an ordinary man. 

1772 
02:32:32,926 --> 02:32:35,512 
Okay, watch it now. 
These are Americans. Americans! 

1773 
02:32:35,637 --> 02:32:38,473 
You can feel the vibe 
of this place. 

1774 
02:32:38,557 --> 02:32:41,935 
Let me take your picture. Hey, 
could you hold... Hey, hello. Hello. 

1775 
02:32:42,060 --> 02:32:43,979 
Could you hold up 
a minute? 

1776 
02:33:06,043 --> 02:33:07,419 
Colby. 

1777 
02:33:23,560 --> 02:33:25,270 
The heads. 

1778 
02:33:25,395 --> 02:33:27,564 
You're looking at the heads. 

1779 
02:33:27,689 --> 02:33:30,859 
I, uh... Sometimes 
he goes too far. 

1780 
02:33:30,984 --> 02:33:33,695 
He's the first one 
to admit it. 

1781 
02:33:34,780 --> 02:33:37,699 
- He's gone crazy. 
- Wrong, wrong! 

1782 
02:33:39,034 --> 02:33:41,870 
If you could have heard 
the man just two days ago... 

1783 
02:33:41,995 --> 02:33:44,623 
if you could have heard 
him then, God... 

1784 
02:33:44,748 --> 02:33:48,001 
- You were gonna call him crazy? 
- Fuckin' A! 

1785 
02:33:50,128 --> 02:33:52,422 
I just wanna talk to him. 

1786 
02:33:53,799 --> 02:33:57,052 
Well, man, he's gone away. 

1787 
02:33:57,177 --> 02:33:59,888 
He's gone away. He disappeared 
out in the jungle with his people. 

1788 
02:34:00,013 --> 02:34:03,100 
- I'll wait for him. 
- He feels comfortable with his people. 

1789 
02:34:03,225 --> 02:34:06,103 
He forgets himself 
with his people. 

1790 
02:34:07,479 --> 02:34:10,232 
- He forgets himself. 
- Captain? 

1791 
02:34:10,357 --> 02:34:13,360 
Maybe we should wait 
back at the boat. 

1792 
02:34:13,485 --> 02:34:14,945 
- I think you should... 
- Okay, Chef. 

1793 
02:34:15,070 --> 02:34:17,280 
We'll go back to the boat 
for a while. 

1794 
02:34:17,406 --> 02:34:20,117 
Yeah, stay with Lance. 

1795 
02:34:43,140 --> 02:34:45,892 
This colonel guy, 
he's wacko, man. 

1796 
02:34:46,017 --> 02:34:48,562 
He's worse than crazy. 
He's evil! 

1797 
02:34:48,687 --> 02:34:51,064 
I mean, that's what the man's got 
set up here, man! 

1798 
02:34:51,189 --> 02:34:53,650 
It's fuckin' pagan idolatry. 
Look around you! 

1799 
02:34:54,693 --> 02:34:57,904 
- Shit, he's loco. 
- Then you'll help me? 

1800 
02:34:58,029 --> 02:35:01,074 
Fuckin' A, I'll help you. I'll do 
anything to get out of this joint. 

1801 
02:35:01,199 --> 02:35:04,411 
- Good boy. 
- We could blow all them assholes away. 

1802 
02:35:04,536 --> 02:35:08,331 
They're so fuckin' spaced out, 
they wouldn't even know it. 

1803 
02:35:08,457 --> 02:35:13,086 
I ain't afraid of all them 
fuckin' skulls and altars and shit. 

1804 
02:35:14,713 --> 02:35:18,592 
I used to think if I died 
in an evil place... 

1805 
02:35:18,717 --> 02:35:21,928 
then my soul wouldn't be able 
to make it to Heaven. 

1806 
02:35:22,054 --> 02:35:25,265 
But now, fuck... 

1807 
02:35:26,850 --> 02:35:29,770 
I mean, I don't care where it goes, 
as long as it ain't here. 

1808 
02:35:29,895 --> 02:35:33,690 
So what do you wanna do? 
I'll kill the fuck. 

1809 
02:35:33,815 --> 02:35:36,735 
- Get out of here. 
- I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef. 

1810 
02:35:36,860 --> 02:35:41,156 
I'll go up with Lance and 
scrounge around, check the place out. 

1811 
02:35:41,281 --> 02:35:43,700 
See if I can find 
the colonel, okay? 

1812 
02:35:45,035 --> 02:35:48,038 
Well, what do you 
want me to do? 

1813 
02:35:48,163 --> 02:35:51,291 
Here. You take the radio... 

1814 
02:35:51,416 --> 02:35:55,712 
and if I don't get back 
by 2200 hours... 

1815 
02:35:57,255 --> 02:35:59,883 
you call in the air strike. 

1816 
02:36:01,259 --> 02:36:03,970 
"Air strike?" 

1817 
02:36:04,096 --> 02:36:05,972 
The code is "Almighty"... 

1818 
02:36:06,098 --> 02:36:09,476 
coordinates zero-niner-two-six- 
four-seven-one-two. 

1819 
02:36:09,601 --> 02:36:11,770 
It's all in there. 

1820 
02:36:13,313 --> 02:36:17,317 
Zero-niner-two-six- 
four-seven-one-two. 

1821 
02:36:24,616 --> 02:36:28,578 
<i>Everything I saw told me 
that Kurtz had gone insane. </i> 

1822 
02:36:32,249 --> 02:36:34,292 
<i>The place was full of bodies... </i> 

1823 
02:36:34,418 --> 02:36:38,588 
<i>North Vietnamese, 
Vietcong, Cambodians. </i> 

1824 
02:36:45,637 --> 02:36:49,975 
<i>If I was still alive, 
it was because he wanted me that way. </i> 

1825 
02:37:23,175 --> 02:37:26,887 
<i>It smelled like 
slow death in there... </i> 

1826 
02:37:27,012 --> 02:37:29,306 
<i>malaria... </i> 

1827 
02:37:29,431 --> 02:37:31,308 
<i>and nightmares. </i> 

1828 
02:37:33,226 --> 02:37:36,146 
<i>This was the end 
of the river, all right. </i> 

1829 
02:37:49,576 --> 02:37:51,828 
Where are you from, Willard? 

1830 
02:37:56,666 --> 02:37:59,127 
I'm from Ohio, sir. 

1831 
02:38:04,091 --> 02:38:06,426 
Were you born there? 

1832 
02:38:06,551 --> 02:38:08,720 
Yes, sir. 

1833 
02:38:08,845 --> 02:38:11,014 
Whereabouts? 

1834 
02:38:11,139 --> 02:38:13,016 
Toledo, sir. 

1835 
02:38:19,064 --> 02:38:21,608 
How far are you 
from the river? 

1836 
02:38:27,739 --> 02:38:29,658 
The Ohio River, sir? 

1837 
02:38:31,993 --> 02:38:33,870 
About 200 miles. 

1838 
02:38:41,753 --> 02:38:44,965 
I went down that river 
once when I was a kid. 

1839 
02:38:49,469 --> 02:38:52,472 
There's a place in the river... 
I can't remember... 

1840 
02:38:52,597 --> 02:38:57,811 
Must've been a gardenia plantation 
or a flower plantation at one time. 

1841 
02:38:57,936 --> 02:39:02,065 
It's all wild and overgrown now. 
But for about... 

1842 
02:39:02,190 --> 02:39:04,651 
for about five miles 
you'd think that... 

1843 
02:39:04,776 --> 02:39:08,238 
heaven just fell 
on the earth... 

1844 
02:39:08,363 --> 02:39:10,741 
in the form of gardenias. 

1845 
02:39:26,923 --> 02:39:28,800 
Have you ever considered... 

1846 
02:39:30,635 --> 02:39:32,512 
any real freedoms? 

1847 
02:39:37,642 --> 02:39:41,396 
Freedoms from 
the opinion of others? 

1848 
02:39:44,066 --> 02:39:47,360 
Even the opinions 
of yourself? 

1849 
02:40:02,376 --> 02:40:06,630 
Did they say why, Willard? 

1850 
02:40:08,173 --> 02:40:12,969 
Why they wanted 
to terminate my command? 

1851 
02:40:28,402 --> 02:40:31,905 
I was sent on 
a classified mission, sir. 

1852 
02:40:34,866 --> 02:40:38,870 
It's no longer 
classified, is it? 

1853 
02:40:45,419 --> 02:40:47,671 
What did they tell you? 

1854 
02:40:50,048 --> 02:40:52,426 
They told me... 

1855 
02:40:52,551 --> 02:40:55,178 
that you had gone... 

1856 
02:40:55,303 --> 02:40:57,180 
totally insane... 

1857 
02:40:59,307 --> 02:41:03,311 
and that your methods... 

1858 
02:41:03,437 --> 02:41:06,356 
were unsound. 

1859 
02:41:09,735 --> 02:41:12,279 
Are my methods unsound? 

1860 
02:41:17,701 --> 02:41:21,329 
I don't see any method... 

1861 
02:41:22,831 --> 02:41:24,708 
at all, sir. 

1862 
02:41:30,839 --> 02:41:33,425 
I expected... 

1863 
02:41:33,550 --> 02:41:35,719 
someone like you. 

1864 
02:41:37,804 --> 02:41:39,848 
What did you expect? 

1865 
02:41:47,439 --> 02:41:49,357 
Are you an assassin? 

1866 
02:41:54,112 --> 02:41:55,864 
I'm a soldier. 

1867 
02:41:58,909 --> 02:42:00,786 
You're neither. 

1868 
02:42:02,496 --> 02:42:05,665 
You're an errand boy... 

1869 
02:42:05,791 --> 02:42:08,460 
sent by grocery clerks... 

1870 
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:14,633 
to collect the bill. 

1871 
02:42:57,634 --> 02:42:59,553 
Why, huh? 

1872 
02:42:59,678 --> 02:43:03,765 
Why would a nice guy 
like you wanna kill a genius? 

1873 
02:43:10,397 --> 02:43:12,607 
Feeling pretty good, huh? 

1874 
02:43:12,733 --> 02:43:14,151 
Why? 

1875 
02:43:15,694 --> 02:43:17,738 
Do you know... 

1876 
02:43:17,863 --> 02:43:20,532 
Do you know that the man... 

1877 
02:43:23,493 --> 02:43:25,620 
the man really likes you? 

1878 
02:43:28,832 --> 02:43:30,917 
He likes you. 
He really likes you. 

1879 
02:43:31,043 --> 02:43:35,922 
But he's got something 
in mind for you. 

1880 
02:43:36,048 --> 02:43:38,592 
Aren't you curious about that? 

1881 
02:43:38,717 --> 02:43:43,680 
I'm curious. I'm very curious. 
Are you curious? 

1882 
02:43:46,516 --> 02:43:49,770 
There's something 
happening out here, man. 

1883 
02:43:53,523 --> 02:43:55,859 
You know something, man. 
I know something that you don't know. 

1884 
02:43:55,984 --> 02:43:58,820 
That's right, Jack. 

1885 
02:43:58,945 --> 02:44:01,907 
The man is clear 
in his mind... 

1886 
02:44:02,032 --> 02:44:04,326 
but his soul is mad. 

1887 
02:44:05,577 --> 02:44:08,080 
Oh, yeah. 

1888 
02:44:08,205 --> 02:44:10,082 
He's dying, I think. 

1889 
02:44:10,207 --> 02:44:13,251 
He hates all this. 
He hates it. 

1890 
02:44:13,377 --> 02:44:16,421 
But the man's... 

1891 
02:44:20,425 --> 02:44:23,095 
He reads poetry out loud, 
all right? 

1892 
02:44:24,971 --> 02:44:26,807 
And a voice... 

1893 
02:44:27,933 --> 02:44:29,476 
a voice... 

1894 
02:44:31,978 --> 02:44:34,648 
He likes you 
'cause you're still alive. 

1895 
02:44:34,773 --> 02:44:39,820 
He's got plans for you. 
No, no, I'm not gonna help you. 

1896 
02:44:39,945 --> 02:44:43,824 
You're gonna help him, man. 
You're gonna help him. 

1897 
02:44:43,949 --> 02:44:46,660 
I mean, what are they gonna say, 
man, when he's gone, huh? 

1898 
02:44:46,785 --> 02:44:51,331 
'Cause he dies when it dies, man. 
When it dies, he dies. 

1899 
02:44:51,456 --> 02:44:55,168 
What are they gonna say about him? What 
are they gonna say? He was a kind man? 

1900 
02:44:55,293 --> 02:44:58,797 
He was a wise man? 
He had plans? He had wisdom? 

1901 
02:44:58,922 --> 02:45:00,799 
Bullshit, man! 

1902 
02:45:00,924 --> 02:45:06,138 
Am I gonna be the one that's gonna 
set them straight? Look at me. Wrong! 

1903 
02:45:09,141 --> 02:45:11,309 
You. 

1904 
02:45:15,480 --> 02:45:17,607 
Almost eight hours. 

1905 
02:45:22,571 --> 02:45:25,198 
I'm asleep. 

1906 
02:45:25,323 --> 02:45:28,827 
I'm asleep and dreaming 
I'm on this shitty boat. 

1907 
02:45:40,380 --> 02:45:41,798 
Fuck. 

1908 
02:45:45,343 --> 02:45:47,763 
Has it been eight hours? 

1909 
02:45:50,182 --> 02:45:52,184

1918

"The War on the Horizon. The American 
people may find it hard to believe... 

1919 
02:49:56,636 --> 02:49:59,347 
that the US is winning 
the war in Vietnam. 

1920 
02:49:59,473 --> 02:50:02,100 
Nevertheless... 

1921 
02:50:02,225 --> 02:50:04,561 
one of the most 
exhaustive inquiries... 

1922 
02:50:04,686 --> 02:50:07,439 
into the status 
of the conflict yet compiled... 

1923 
02:50:07,564 --> 02:50:10,817 
offers considerable evidence 
that the weight of US power... 

1924 
02:50:10,942 --> 02:50:13,487 
two-and-a-half years 
after the big build-up began... 

1925 
02:50:13,612 --> 02:50:16,656 
is beginning to 
make itself felt. 

1926 
02:50:16,782 --> 02:50:20,452 
White House officials maintain 
the impact of that strength... 

1927 
02:50:22,037 --> 02:50:25,165 
may bring the enemy 
to the point where he could... 

1928 
02:50:25,290 --> 02:50:28,460 
simply be unable 
to continue fighting." 

1929 
02:50:30,420 --> 02:50:31,588 
Is this familiar? 

1930 
02:50:33,548 --> 02:50:37,177 
"Because Lyndon Johnson 
fears that the US public... 

1931

is in no mood to accept 
its optimistic conclusions... 

1932 
02:50:40,764 --> 02:50:43,683 
he may never permit the report 
to be released in full. 

1933 
02:50:43,809 --> 02:50:46,978 
Even so, he is sufficiently 
impressed with the findings... 

1934 
02:50:47,104 --> 02:50:50,440 
and sufficiently anxious to 
make their conclusions known... 

1935 
02:50:50,565 --> 02:50:53,527 
to permit experts 
who have been working on it... 

1936 
02:50:53,652 --> 02:50:55,654 
to talk about it 
in general terms."

that things felt 
much better... 

1944 
02:51:33,024 --> 02:51:35,819

1945 
02:51:37,404 --> 02:51:39,990 
How do they smell 
to you, soldier? 

1946

Alas, our dried voices

1963 
02:56:05,547 --> 02:56:09,176 
This is dialectics. 
It's very simple dialectics. 

1964 
02:56:09,301 --> 02:56:12,846 
It's one through nine. 
No maybes, no supposes, no fractions.

with fractions. 

1967

What are you gonna land on? 
One-quarter? Three-eighths? 

1968 
02:56:21,188 --> 02:56:23,565 
What are you gonna do when 
you go from here to Venus? 

1969 
02:56:23,690 --> 02:56:25,067 
That's dialectic physics, okay. 

1970 
02:56:25,192 --> 02:56:27,569 
Dialectic logic is, 
there's only love and hate. 

1971 
02:56:27,694 --> 02:56:29,654 
You either love somebody 
or you hate 'em. 

1972

Mutt! 

1973

This is the way 
the fucking world is.

we're in, man! 

1976

A whimper. 

1977

I was going to do than I did. </i>

could see what I saw... </i>

to kill him? </i> 

1987 
02:57:53,155 --> 02:57:56,158 
<i>More than ever, probably. </i> 

1988 
02:57:56,283 --> 02:57:59,202 
<i>And what would his people back home 
want if they ever learned... </i> 

1989 
02:57:59,327 --> 02:58:01,872 
<i>just how far from them 
he'd really gone? </i> 

1990 
02:58:03,999 --> 02:58:05,959 
<i>He broke from them... </i> 

1991 
02:58:06,084 --> 02:58:08,795 
<i>and then he broke 
from himself. </i> 

1992 
02:58:08,920 --> 02:58:12,257 
<i>I'd never seen a man 
so broken up and... </i> 

1993 
02:58:12,382 --> 02:58:14,259 
<i>ripped apart. </i> 

1994 
02:58:14,384 --> 02:58:17,054

1995 
02:58:17,179 --> 02:58:19,514 
horrors that you've seen. 

1996 
02:58:21,058 --> 02:58:23,060 
But you have no right 
to call me a murderer. 

1997 
02:58:23,185 --> 02:58:26,271 
You have a right to kill me. 

1998 
02:58:26,396 --> 02:58:29,274 
You have a right 
to do that. 

1999 
02:58:30,525 --> 02:58:33,111 
But you have no right 
to judge me. 

2000 
02:58:39,451 --> 02:58:41,745 
It's impossible for words... 

2001 
02:58:43,455 --> 02:58:44,998 
to describe... 

2002 
02:58:46,958 --> 02:58:50,253 
what is necessary... 

2003 
02:58:52,297 --> 02:58:54,549 
to those... 

2004 
02:58:54,674 --> 02:58:57,177 
who do not know... 

2005 
02:58:57,302 --> 02:59:00,889 
what horror means. 

2006 
02:59:02,724 --> 02:59:04,101 
Horror. 

2007 
02:59:06,895 --> 02:59:09,773 
Horror has a face. 

2008 
02:59:12,067 --> 02:59:15,404 
And you must make 
a friend of horror. 

2009 
02:59:15,487 --> 02:59:19,116 
Horror and moral terror... 

2010 
02:59:19,241 --> 02:59:21,118 
are your friends. 

2011 
02:59:21,243 --> 02:59:23,370 
If they are not... 

2012 
02:59:23,495 --> 02:59:27,249 
then they are enemies 
to be feared. 

2013 
02:59:27,374 --> 02:59:29,751 
They are truly enemies. 

2014 
02:59:34,464 --> 02:59:38,301 
I remember when I was 
with Special Forces. 

2015 
02:59:41,763 --> 02:59:45,767 
Seems a thousand centuries ago. 

2016 
02:59:49,229 --> 02:59:51,982 
We went into a camp 
to inoculate... 

2017 
02:59:54,234 --> 02:59:55,819 
some children. 

2018 
02:59:59,698 --> 03:00:02,409 
We'd left the camp... 

2019 
03:00:02,534 --> 03:00:05,787 
after we had inoculated 
the children for polio. 

2020 
03:00:07,456 --> 03:00:10,125 
And this old man came running 
after us, and he was crying. 

2021 
03:00:10,250 --> 03:00:12,169 
He couldn't say. 

2022 
03:00:14,588 --> 03:00:16,840 
We went back there... 

2023 
03:00:16,965 --> 03:00:20,677 
and they had come 
and hacked off... 

2024 
03:00:20,802 --> 03:00:23,346 
every inoculated arm. 

2025 
03:00:24,890 --> 03:00:27,267 
There they were, 
in a pile... 

2026 
03:00:27,392 --> 03:00:28,935 
a pile of... 

2027 
03:00:30,562 --> 03:00:32,481 
little arms. 

2028 
03:00:33,732 --> 03:00:36,735 
And I remember... 

2029 
03:00:38,236 --> 03:00:41,281 
I-I... I cried. 

2030 
03:00:41,406 --> 03:00:43,325 
I wept like... 

2031 
03:00:44,910 --> 03:00:48,121 
some grandmother. 

2032 
03:00:49,831 --> 03:00:54,628 
I wanted to tear my teeth out. 
I didn't know what I wanted to do. 

2033 
03:00:54,753 --> 03:00:57,839 
And I want to remember it. 
I never want to forget it. 

2034 
03:00:57,964 --> 03:01:00,675 
I never want to forget. 

2035 
03:01:00,801 --> 03:01:03,553 
And then I realized... 

2036 
03:01:04,679 --> 03:01:06,640 
like I was shot... 

2037 
03:01:06,765 --> 03:01:09,976 
like I was shot 
with a diamond... 

2038 
03:01:10,102 --> 03:01:13,772 
a diamond bullet 
right through my forehead. 

2039 
03:01:15,315 --> 03:01:19,194 
And I thought, 
"My God, the genius of that. 

2040 
03:01:19,319 --> 03:01:21,697 
The genius." 

2041 
03:01:21,822 --> 03:01:24,574 
The will to do that. 

2042 
03:01:26,076 --> 03:01:30,831 
Perfect, genuine, complete, 
crystalline, pure. 

2043 
03:01:32,749 --> 03:01:34,626 
And then I realized... 

2044 
03:01:34,751 --> 03:01:38,547 
they were stronger than me 
because they could stand it. 

2045 
03:01:38,672 --> 03:01:41,383 
These were not monsters. 
These were men... 

2046 
03:01:41,508 --> 03:01:44,010 
trained cadres. 

2047 
03:01:44,136 --> 03:01:46,763 
These men who fought 
with their hearts... 

2048 
03:01:46,888 --> 03:01:48,849 
who have families, 
who have children... 

2049 
03:01:48,974 --> 03:01:50,892 
who are filled with love... 

2050 
03:01:51,017 --> 03:01:54,354 
that they had the strength... 

2051 
03:01:54,479 --> 03:01:56,398 
the strength... 

2052 
03:02:00,068 --> 03:02:01,945 
to do that. 

2053 
03:02:02,070 --> 03:02:07,075 
If I had ten divisions 
of those men... 

2054 
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:10,704 
then our troubles here 
would be over very quickly. 

2055 
03:02:12,330 --> 03:02:15,459 
You have to have men... 

2056 
03:02:15,542 --> 03:02:17,461 
who are moral... 

2057 
03:02:18,920 --> 03:02:21,214 
and at the same time... 

2058 
03:02:21,339 --> 03:02:23,425 
who are able to... 

2059 
03:02:24,509 --> 03:02:26,428 
utilize their... 

2060 
03:02:28,722 --> 03:02:32,476 
primordial instincts to kill... 

2061 
03:02:32,601 --> 03:02:35,562 
without feeling, 
without passion... 

2062 
03:02:36,813 --> 03:02:40,442 
without judgment... 
without judgment. 

2063 
03:02:44,821 --> 03:02:48,325 
Because it's judgment 
that defeats us. 

2064 
03:03:06,885 --> 03:03:10,097 
I worry that my son... 

2065 
03:03:10,222 --> 03:03:14,142 
might not understand 
what I've tried to be. 

2066 
03:03:16,395 --> 03:03:21,525 
And if I were 
to be killed, Willard... 

2067 
03:03:22,734 --> 03:03:25,487 
I would want someone 
to go to my home... 

2068 
03:03:25,612 --> 03:03:28,949 
and tell my son everything. 

2069 
03:03:31,410 --> 03:03:35,872 
Everything I did. 
Everything you saw. 

2070 
03:03:35,997 --> 03:03:40,001 
Because there's nothing 
that I detest more than... 

2071 
03:03:40,127 --> 03:03:42,462 
<i>the stench of lies. </i> 

2072 
03:03:44,589 --> 03:03:47,843 
<i>And if you understand me, 
Willard, you... </i> 

2073 
03:03:49,720 --> 03:03:52,848 
<i>you will do this for me. </i> 

2074 
03:04:58,330 --> 03:05:02,084 
<i>PBRStreet Gang, 
this is Almighty. Over. </i> 

2075 
03:05:02,209 --> 03:05:06,088 
<i>PBRStreet Gang, this is 
Almighty standing by. Over. </i> 

2076 
03:05:07,464 --> 03:05:12,135 
<i>PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty 
standing by. How do you copy? </i> 

2077 
03:05:16,848 --> 03:05:20,310 
<i>They were gonna make me 
a major for this... </i> 

2078 
03:05:20,435 --> 03:05:23,438 
<i>and I wasn't even in 
their fuckin' army any more. </i> 

2079 
03:05:25,691 --> 03:05:29,111 
<i>Everybody wanted me to do it. </i> 

2080 
03:05:29,236 --> 03:05:32,155 
<i>Him most of all. </i> 

2081 
03:05:32,280 --> 03:05:34,700 
<i>I felt like he was up there... </i> 

2082 
03:05:34,825 --> 03:05:37,953 
<i>waiting for me 
to take the pain away. </i> 

2083 
03:05:40,038 --> 03:05:42,624 
<i>He just wanted to go out 
like a soldier... </i> 

2084 
03:05:42,749 --> 03:05:45,460 
<i>standing up. </i> 

2085 
03:05:45,544 --> 03:05:49,589 
<i>Not like some poor, 
wasted, rag-assed renegade. </i> 

2086 
03:05:52,926 --> 03:05:56,012 
<i>Even the jungle wanted him dead. </i> 

2087 
03:05:56,138 --> 03:05:59,391 
<i>And that's who he really 
took his orders from anyway. </i> 

2088 
03:06:39,222 --> 03:06:43,101 
<i>Come on, baby 
take a chance with us</i> 

2089 
03:06:47,898 --> 03:06:52,069 
<i>Come on, baby 
take a chance with us</i> 

2090 
03:06:56,448 --> 03:06:59,493 
<i>Come on, baby 
take a chance with us</i> 

2091 
03:06:59,618 --> 03:07:04,831 
<i>And meet me at the back 
of the blue bus tonight</i> 

2092 
03:07:04,956 --> 03:07:07,459 
<i>Blue bus tonight</i> 

2093 
03:07:07,584 --> 03:07:10,629 
<i>Blue bus tonight 
Blue</i> 

2094 
03:07:10,754 --> 03:07:14,132 
<i>Come on, yeah</i> 

2095 
03:07:16,343 --> 03:07:19,054 
We train young men 
to drop fire on people... 

2096 
03:07:19,179 --> 03:07:22,599 
but their commanders... 

2097 
03:07:22,724 --> 03:07:26,269 
won't allow them 
to write "fuck"... 

2098 
03:07:26,395 --> 03:07:29,439 
on their aeroplanes because... 

2099 
03:07:29,523 --> 03:07:31,441 
it's obscene. 

2100 
03:08:54,232 --> 03:08:56,109 
The horror. 

2101 
03:08:59,821 --> 03:09:01,156 
The horror. 

2102 
03:14:23,854 --> 03:14:25,856 
<i>Calling PBRStreet Gang. </i> 

2103 
03:14:26,857 --> 03:14:30,277 
<i>PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty. 
Do you read me? Over. </i> 

2104 
03:14:31,737 --> 03:14:34,406 
<i>PBRStreet Gang? </i> 

2105 
03:14:34,531 --> 03:14:36,658 
<i>PBRStreet Gang, 
this is Almighty... </i> 

2106 
03:15:14,446 --> 03:15:16,031 
<i>The horror. </i> 

2107 
03:15:19,951 --> 03:15:21,536 
<i>The horror. </i>
