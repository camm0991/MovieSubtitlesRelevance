1
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:45,477
<i>Once upon a time, a long time ago,</i>

2
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:49,148
<i>a king and queen had a
beautiful daughter named Fiona.</i>

3
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:52,025
<i>But she was possessed
by a terrible curse.</i>

4
00:00:52,193 --> 00:00:56,822
<i>By day, a lovely princess.
By night, a hideous ogre.</i>

5
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,741
<i>Only true love's kiss
could lift her curse.</i>

6
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,079
<i>So Fiona waited in a tower,
guarded by a dragon, until the day</i>

7
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:06,957
<i>when her true love would arrive.</i>

8
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,459
<i>But as the days turned into years,</i>

9
00:01:09,627 --> 00:01:13,589
<i>the King and Queen were forced
to resort to more desperate measures.</i>

10
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,226
Whoa, there.

11
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:10,312
I don't know about this, Lillian.

12
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,816
Fairy Godmother said only true love's
kiss could break Fiona's curse.

13
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:19,238
I don't trust that woman, Harold.
This may be our last hope.

14
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,532
Besides, he does come
highly recommended by King Midas.

15
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,329
But to put our daughter's life
in the hands of this... person?

16
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:32,209
He's devious.
He's deceitful. He's, he's...

17
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:34,753
Rumpelstiltskin!

18
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,133
Mrs Highness.

19
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,177
How do you do?

20
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,847
Down, Fifi. Get down!

21
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,352
As you can see, everything's in order.

22
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,231
So you'll put an end
to our daughter's curse?

23
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:58,735
And, in return, you sign the kingdom
of Far Far Away over to me.

24
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:08,954
- Lillian, this is madness!
- What choice do we have?

25
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,666
Fiona has been locked away
in that tower far too long.

26
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,918
It's not like she's getting any younger.

27
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:17,754
But to sign over our entire kingdom?

28
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:20,841
Well, if your kingdom's worth
more to you than your daughter...

29
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:24,636
Nothing is worth more to us
than our daughter.

30
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,641
Jump, Fifi, jump!

31
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:39,651
Just sign it and all your problems
will disappear.

32
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,664
Your Highness! The Princess!
She's been saved!

33
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,171
Who saved her?

34
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:02,716
No one would have guessed
that an ogre named Shrek,

35
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:04,968
whose roar was feared
throughout the land,

36
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:07,804
would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.

37
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:10,932
True love's kiss led to marriage
and ogre babies!

38
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,227
The kingdom of Far Far Away
was finally at peace.

39
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:18,774
Goody for them!
And they lived happily ever after!

40
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,153
Sir? You're gonna
have to pay for that.

41
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,074
Maybe we could make a deal
for it, little boy?

42
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:30,952
- Oh, I'm not a real boy.
- Do you want to be?

43
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:37,876
Nobody needs your deals
anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!

44
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:47,386
I wish that ogre was never born!

45
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,650
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!

46
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,570
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.

47
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:10,242
Better out than in.

48
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:12,160
That's my line.

49
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:15,288
Did my little Fergus make a...

50
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:18,708
...big, grownup ogre stink?!

51
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:22,087
Oh, that's diabolical!

52
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:27,426
And on your left, the lovable lug
that showed us you don't have to

53
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,970
change your undies
to change the world!

54
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,306
I wonder what Shrek's up to in there.

55
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:36,768
Get in there. Get...
Impossible to put on!

56
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:41,064
OK, the dragon goes under the bridge,
through the loop...

57
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:43,608
...and finally, into the castle.

58
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,323
Play date!

59
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,499
Then Shrek kissed the Princess.

60
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,710
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

61
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:02,919
Happily...

62
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:04,546
- Ever...
- After.

63
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,512
Look! A shooting star!

64
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,725
So, what did you wish for?

65
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:18,977
That every day could be like this one.

66
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,604
Come here, you.

67
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,951
Morning, Daddy.

68
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,244
Morning.

69
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,498
Better out than in.

70
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,667
Did my little Fergus make a...

71
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,048
Cute. Real cute.

72
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,009
This lovable lug taught us

73
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,095
you don't have to change
your undies to change the world!

74
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,181
Play date!

75
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:01,394
Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!

76
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:04,523
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

77
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,690
- Happily...
- Ever...

78
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:06,900
After?

79
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,863
- Daddy, get up!
- Morning.

80
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:16,868
- Better out than in.
- This lovable lug...

81
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:19,204
- Play date!
- No!

82
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,290
Outhouse again!

83
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,542
Come on.

84
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:28,630
Undies!

85
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:31,550
Outhouse!

86
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,843
- Get up, get up!
- And they lived...

87
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:35,470
- Happily...
- Ever...

88
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:36,888
After.

89
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,940
Roar.

90
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,658
Nice landing, baby.

91
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,202
Hey! Now remember, don't eat the valet.

92
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:27,290
Happy birthday, ninos!
Vamos a la fiesta!

93
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:30,251
Hey, Shrek, Shrek!

94
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,047
Mr Shrek, would you
sign our pitchforks?

95
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:35,298
And our torches?

96
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:37,175
Oh, man, you used to be so fierce!

97
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,177
Yeah, when you were a real ogre!

98
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,262
A real ogre?

99
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:55,735
Shrek, it's a sing-along.
You've got to sing along!

100
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:59,030
- No, thanks.
- Please? I'll be your best friend.

101
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:03,660
Why does being your best friend entail
me doing everything I don't want to do?

102
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:06,162
Please, Felicia, not in Daddy's ear.

103
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,580
Excuse me, Mr Shrek?

104
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:09,916
Could you do that
ogre roar of yours for my son?

105
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:11,584
He's a big, big fan.

106
00:10:11,752 --> 00:10:12,877
Do the roar.

107
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,839
You know, I'd rather not.
It's my kids' birthday party.

108
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:18,007
- Do the roar.
- Honey?

109
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:19,509
Why don't you go check on the cake?

110
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:23,054
- Sure.
- And don't forget the candles.

111
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,222
Hold still.

112
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,391
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man.

113
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,436
I always wanted chaps!
Yee-haw! Giddy up!

114
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:30,979
- Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!

115
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:32,981
Your cake. VoilÃ !

116
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:37,318
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!

117
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,863
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.

118
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,282
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!

119
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,033
I'm in a great mood, actually.

120
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:47,078
- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!

121
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,413
As long as you're not doing anything,

122
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,039
how about one of those
famous Shrek roars?

123
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:52,751
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.

124
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,462
An ogre only roars when he's angry.

125
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:57,714
You don't want to see me angry, do you?

126
00:10:57,882 --> 00:10:59,174
Do it.

127
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,469
Hold it together. Just hold it together.

128
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:04,721
Daddy, he's getting away. Do something.

129
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:06,181
Oh, good.

130
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:09,851
- What happened to the cake?
- Trust me. It's an improvement.

131
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,603
- You licked it!
- No.

132
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,647
Just because you're an ogre,
doesn't mean you have to eat like one.

133
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,108
Looks like you forgot the candles!

134
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,527
OK, just watch the cake.
I'll go get them.

135
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:20,987
Watch the cake?

136
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,782
- Where's the cake?!
- We ate the cake.

137
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,033
- Ya.
- What?

138
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:26,451
No, don't cry.

139
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,120
Hey! I believe you
promised my son a roar.

140
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,705
- Do the roar.
- Roar.

141
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:33,166
- I don't like it.
- Pigs, we need another cake.

142
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:36,169
- We ate the other cakes.
- One roar, man.

143
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:38,755
Hey, everybody!
Shrek's gonna do his famous ogre roar!

144
00:11:38,923 --> 00:11:41,633
Not now, Donkey.
Pigs, are there any cupcakes?

145
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,676
- We ate them, too.
- They have lollipops.

146
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:45,011
No, I ate them.

147
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:47,889
- You didn't share?
- Well, you didn't share the croissants!

148
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:51,059
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Shrek, what's going on?

149
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:53,186
- Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!
- Do the roar.

150
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,648
We need the cake!

151
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,318
Cake! Cake! Cake!

152
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:16,459
I love you, Daddy.

153
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:19,337
Everybody, I have found another cake!

154
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,715
Shrek? Are you OK?

155
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:53,663
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it! Those villagers...

156
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:57,166
I'm not talking about the villagers,
Shrek. I'm talking about you.

157
00:12:57,334 --> 00:13:00,336
Is this really how you want
to remember the kids' first birthday?

158
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:04,507
- Oh, great. So this is all my fault?
- Yes. But you know what?

159
00:13:04,675 --> 00:13:06,718
Let's talk about this
after the party, at home.

160
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,596
You mean that roadside
attraction we live in?

161
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:14,267
Step right up! See the dancing ogre!
Don't worry! He won't bite!

162
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:18,605
I used to be an ogre.
Now I'm just a jolly green joke!

163
00:13:18,772 --> 00:13:23,067
OK, OK, maybe you're not
the ogre you used to be.

164
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,944
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.

165
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:28,781
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's not like you're a real ogre.

166
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:31,242
You spent half your life in a palace.

167
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,953
And the other half
locked away in a tower.

168
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:39,417
Look, all I want is for things to go
back to the way they used to be!

169
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:44,339
Back when villagers were afraid of me,
and I could take a mud bath in peace.

170
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:48,092
When I could do what I wanted,
when I wanted to do it!

171
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,638
Back when the world made sense!

172
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:54,474
You mean back before you
rescued me from the Dragon's Keep?

173
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:56,017
Exactly!

174
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:06,110
Shrek, you have
three beautiful children,

175
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,446
a wife who loves you,

176
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:12,659
friends who adore you.
You have everything.

177
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,499
Why is it the only person
who can't see that is you?

178
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,980
That's just great.

179
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,407
If she thinks I'm gonna
slink back there and apologize,

180
00:14:52,574 --> 00:14:55,827
she's got another thing coming.
She's not the boss of me.

181
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:59,831
I'm an ogre and I'm not gonna apologize
for acting like one.

182
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:04,335
Help, please!
Someone, anyone at all, help me!

183
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,254
Please, help!

184
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:08,297
Please, help!

185
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,466
I'm stuck! Help!

186
00:15:10,634 --> 00:15:12,468
Oh, please, help!

187
00:15:12,636 --> 00:15:15,430
Someone, anyone! Help me!

188
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:19,100
The pain! I can see
a bright light. A tunnel!

189
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,728
Grandma? Is that you?

190
00:15:21,895 --> 00:15:23,271
Yeah, it's me, Granny.

191
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:27,025
An ogre! Please, Mr Ogre,
please don't eat me!

192
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,735
I'm not gonna eat you.

193
00:15:28,902 --> 00:15:32,196
But you are an ogre... Aren't you?

194
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,199
Yeah, well, I... I used to be.

195
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,785
Look, move out or get crushed.

196
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:39,954
So you're not gonna eat me?

197
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:44,959
No, thanks. I already had a big bowl
of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

198
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,338
Wait up! What's your rush?
Where you going?

199
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:50,506
Nowhere.

200
00:15:50,674 --> 00:15:53,342
What a coincidence!
I was just heading that way myself.

201
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:58,014
But, seriously,
let me give you a ride. I insist.

202
00:15:58,182 --> 00:16:02,560
Come on. It's the least I can do
after all you've done for me.

203
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:05,646
I got a hot rat cooking.

204
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:11,277
All right! Can I interest you
in a mudslide? Slug and tonic?

205
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:14,405
A liquid libation
to ease that frustration?

206
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:18,868
- Eyeball-tini?
- Well, maybe just one.

207
00:16:19,787 --> 00:16:23,790
So the centaur says,
"That's not the half I'm talking about. "

208
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,543
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you.

209
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:31,047
To live the life of an ogre...
no worries, no responsibilities.

210
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:33,966
You are free to pillage
and terrorize as you please.

211
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:37,428
- Free? That's a laugh.
- Oh, yeah?

212
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:43,184
Sometimes I wish I had just one day
to feel like a real ogre again.

213
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:44,477
Why didn't you say so?

214
00:16:44,645 --> 00:16:47,814
Magical transactions are my specialty!

215
00:16:47,981 --> 00:16:51,692
Great. Next to mimes,
magicians are my favourite people.

216
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:54,153
Hold on.

217
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:57,490
"King for a Month. "
"Knight for a Week. "

218
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:02,870
Ogre for a day.

219
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:06,541
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated.

220
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:07,750
You'll be, like, "Roar!"

221
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:11,504
And the villagers will be, like, "Get
away! It's Shrek! I'm so scared of him!"

222
00:17:11,672 --> 00:17:15,049
It would be just like the good old days,
when your swamp was your castle.

223
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:20,847
- When the world made sense.
- All right, what's the catch?

224
00:17:21,014 --> 00:17:24,684
Catch? No. There's no catch.
No catchings, really.

225
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:26,936
I mean, there's something.
Small thing. Nothing. A little thing.

226
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:30,106
All right, I knew it.
So what do you want?

227
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:32,108
- A day.
- A day.

228
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:33,317
Rat's done!

229
00:17:34,862 --> 00:17:38,030
To make the magic work, you gotta
give something to get something.

230
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:41,117
In this case, you gotta
give a day to get a day. That's all.

231
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:43,995
I can't just pick up
and leave my family.

232
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,832
But that's the best part, Shrek!
It's a magical contract.

233
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,834
No one will even know you're gone.

234
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:55,798
And by the time this day is up,
you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.

235
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:58,759
Still, I don't know.

236
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:02,471
Hey, no problem.
Forget it, no big D. Doesn't matter.

237
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:05,141
Do you like white meat or dark meat?

238
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:09,395
So what day would I have to give up?

239
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:12,440
I don't know, any day.
A day from your past.

240
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:15,026
A day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?

241
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,612
A day some meddling oaf
stuck his nose where it didn't belong

242
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:19,405
destroying your business
and ruining your life?!

243
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:24,535
Just for an example.

244
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,454
How about the day I met Donkey?

245
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:29,123
Now, there's a day
I'd like to take back.

246
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,292
I don't know who that is.

247
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:34,712
I know. What about a day
you wouldn't even remember?

248
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,089
Like a day when you were a baby.

249
00:18:37,257 --> 00:18:42,511
- An innocent, mindless little baby.
- Take any of those days you want.

250
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,058
- Take them all for all I care.
- Oh, just one will do.

251
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:51,103
OK, good.
A day from your childhood it is.

252
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:54,899
I guess there's nothing wrong
with wanting a little time for myself.

253
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,609
Just 24 tiny little hours.

254
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:58,861
- I'm still my own ogre!
- Yeah, you is!

255
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:01,280
I never needed to ask
for anyone's permission before.

256
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:04,116
So why start now?

257
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:14,252
Go on, Shrek.

258
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,962
Sign it!

259
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:18,506
Go on, Shrek.

260
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:21,175
Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!

261
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:24,178
You signed it.

262
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:27,139
So, tell me. What happens now?

263
00:19:27,307 --> 00:19:28,975
Have a nice day.

264
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,370
I think I fell on my keys.

265
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:51,122
There are 40 children in that shoe,

266
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,833
which is why the weasel
goes pop to this very day.

267
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:55,042
Oh, great.

268
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,712
As we head over the river
and through the woods...

269
00:19:57,879 --> 00:19:58,921
Ogre!

270
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:24,196
Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!

271
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:20,544
This is the part where you run away!

272
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:44,610
Sure is great to be wanted again.

273
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:47,446
Nice one.

274
00:21:56,123 --> 00:21:57,498
Fiona?

275
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:09,176
Oh, no.

276
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,817
My home.

277
00:22:26,153 --> 00:22:27,486
Fiona!

278
00:22:29,656 --> 00:22:32,491
Fiona! Are you in there?!

279
00:23:10,197 --> 00:23:12,364
All right, Rumpel!

280
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:15,534
This wasn't part of the deal!

281
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:20,372
Rumpel!

282
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,812
Ogre!

283
00:23:44,898 --> 00:23:48,234
We've got another one, ladies! Get him!

284
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:51,445
Who are you?!

285
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:53,614
What are you doing in my swamp?

286
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,081
Looks like a troublemaker!

287
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:15,928
Spread 'em!

288
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:20,266
Nice job, ladies!

289
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:32,111
You witches are making a big mistake!
I know my rights!

290
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,613
You have the right to shut your mouth!

291
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:57,970
Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?

292
00:24:58,805 --> 00:25:00,139
Donkey!

293
00:25:09,482 --> 00:25:11,984
Donkey, where am I? What's happening?

294
00:25:12,152 --> 00:25:15,321
Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.

295
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:24,830
I'm driving,
so I'm in charge of the music.

296
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:28,834
Will you witches make up your mind?

297
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:41,221
Donkey? What's going on?
Do you know where Fiona is?

298
00:25:41,848 --> 00:25:44,558
Quiet, ogre! You're gonna get me
in trouble and I need this job.

299
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:46,393
I am not going back to work
for Old MacDonald.

300
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:49,355
Tell me to E-I-E-I-O.
"E-I-E-I-No!" That's what I said.

301
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:53,233
Where are my babies?
And where's your wife, Dragon?

302
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:56,236
Look, I think you have me confused
with some other talking donkey.

303
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:57,780
I've never seen you before in my life.

304
00:25:57,947 --> 00:26:00,532
Never seen me before?
Come on, Donkey!

305
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,868
And how do you
know my name anyway?

306
00:26:03,036 --> 00:26:05,913
It's me, Shrek. Your best friend?

307
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:07,998
A donkey and an ogre friends?

308
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,417
That's the most
ridiculous thing I ever heard!

309
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:15,756
Can you at least tell me
where they're taking me?

310
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:19,093
To the same place they take
every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.

311
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:22,971
- Stiltskin!
- I said quiet!

312
00:26:30,397 --> 00:26:33,107
Oh, no.

313
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:47,079
It's time to crumble!

314
00:26:47,247 --> 00:26:51,583
Place your bets!
Place your bets! We start tout de suite!

315
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:52,793
Yeah!

316
00:26:55,922 --> 00:26:57,297
Gingy?

317
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:03,095
Gingy snap!

318
00:27:05,682 --> 00:27:06,724
There's one!

319
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,600
Disgusting, filthy ogre!

320
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:10,519
Hideous monster!

321
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:12,312
Filthy, filthy creature!

322
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,773
Disgusting creature!

323
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,551
Move it!

324
00:27:59,652 --> 00:28:02,404
Don't worry, Donkey.
I'll get us our lives back.

325
00:28:02,572 --> 00:28:05,741
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard
on mine, Captain Crazy!

326
00:28:42,862 --> 00:28:44,696
Mr Stiltskin?

327
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:48,867
You got another customer.

328
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:51,745
- Wolfie!
- Yes, Mr Stiltskin.

329
00:28:51,913 --> 00:28:53,747
Bring me my business wig.

330
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:56,124
Mr Stiltskin, please!

331
00:28:59,045 --> 00:29:01,505
- OK, go.
- Please make me a real boy!

332
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:05,050
Go away! Terms are
in the details, balsa boy.

333
00:29:05,218 --> 00:29:07,970
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!

334
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:09,888
Stiltskin!

335
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:12,349
Shrek!

336
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,769
There he is!

337
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:18,188
So close!

338
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,900
Have I been waiting for you!

339
00:29:22,777 --> 00:29:25,279
Ladies, this is the guy

340
00:29:25,446 --> 00:29:28,824
that made all of this possible!

341
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:32,452
So, tell me, how are you
enjoying your day?

342
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,747
All right, Rumpel, what's going on?
What have you done?

343
00:29:35,915 --> 00:29:39,084
No, Shrek, it's not what I've done.
It's what you've done.

344
00:29:39,252 --> 00:29:43,046
Thanks to you, the King and Queen
signed their kingdom over to me.

345
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,631
They would never do that.

346
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,428
They would if I promised them
all their problems would disappear.

347
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,265
And then they disappeared!

348
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:03,984
They would have done anything

349
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:06,278
if they thought it would
end their daughter's curse.

350
00:30:06,446 --> 00:30:08,822
I ended Fiona's curse!

351
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,326
How could you when you never existed?

352
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:15,495
You better start making sense,
you dirty little man!

353
00:30:15,663 --> 00:30:17,956
Here, let me spell it out for you!

354
00:30:18,124 --> 00:30:22,461
You gave me a day from your past,
a day you couldn't even remember.

355
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:26,840
A day when you were
an innocent, mindless little baby.

356
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,054
You took the day I was born.

357
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:35,223
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.

358
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:38,936
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin,
because when this day is up...

359
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,813
But you haven't heard the best part.

360
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:47,694
Since you were never born, once
this day comes to an end, so will you.

361
00:30:51,741 --> 00:30:53,367
Where's Fiona?

362
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:55,285
Where's my family?

363
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:58,664
Silly little ogre.
You don't get it, do you?

364
00:30:58,831 --> 00:31:01,375
You see, you were never born.

365
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:03,669
You never met Fiona.

366
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:07,422
Your kids don't exist.

367
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:13,512
How's that for a metaphysical paradox?

368
00:31:15,348 --> 00:31:17,766
Looks like you got
exactly what you wanted!

369
00:31:18,768 --> 00:31:22,020
- Happy Ogre Day!
- Rumpel!

370
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:25,315
Get him, witches!

371
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:39,079
You know what'd help morale
around here? Flip-flop Fridays.

372
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:41,915
Feet be comfortable
with the breeze on your toes.

373
00:31:48,923 --> 00:31:50,590
Come on, girls!

374
00:32:01,227 --> 00:32:04,938
Lock all the doors,
you worthless witches! Do it!

375
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:09,359
I'll be right back, Donkey!

376
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:12,946
I don't know you! I don't know him!

377
00:32:32,425 --> 00:32:34,426
I'm glad I'm not you.

378
00:32:39,098 --> 00:32:40,432
Help me! Help!

379
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:42,642
Help!

380
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,652
No, not my pretty ball!

381
00:32:57,116 --> 00:32:58,950
Watch out!

382
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:12,130
Wolfie?

383
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:14,633
My angry wig.

384
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:26,645
Help! I've been kidnapped
by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!

385
00:33:26,813 --> 00:33:28,230
Donkey! Get off of me!

386
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:31,316
Watch it with your pointy hooves!

387
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:39,991
- Just take my wallet!
- Hey!

388
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,160
I'm being ass-napped!

389
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:43,954
Animal cruelty! Help!

390
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,206
You need to calm down!

391
00:33:46,374 --> 00:33:47,541
I'm your friend.

392
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,377
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?

393
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:53,213
Good. I'm gonna let go...

394
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:55,841
...right... now.

395
00:33:56,008 --> 00:33:58,552
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!

396
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:01,179
Donkey! You've got to trust me.

397
00:34:01,347 --> 00:34:03,932
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...

398
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,184
Because...

399
00:34:09,856 --> 00:34:11,189
OK.

400
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,273
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?

401
00:35:26,807 --> 00:35:29,476
I've never seen an ogre cry.

402
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:36,691
I'm not crying.

403
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:38,902
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.

404
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,988
Just thinking about my grandma,
or thinking about baby kittens,

405
00:35:42,156 --> 00:35:46,493
or my grandma kissing a baby kitten,
or a little baby grandma kitten.

406
00:35:47,828 --> 00:35:50,789
- That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!

407
00:35:50,957 --> 00:35:52,832
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.

408
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,834
It's none of my business
why you're upset.

409
00:35:55,836 --> 00:35:57,170
By the way, why are you upset?

410
00:35:57,338 --> 00:36:00,215
I was tricked into signing something
I shouldn't have.

411
00:36:00,383 --> 00:36:02,676
You signed up for one of them
time-shares, huh?

412
00:36:02,843 --> 00:36:05,512
No. I signed this.

413
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,682
You should never sign a contract
with Rumpelstiltskin!

414
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:10,183
Yeah, I got that.

415
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:12,352
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.

416
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,854
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...

417
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,149
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.

418
00:36:18,317 --> 00:36:19,484
Used to be, you had to guess his name,

419
00:36:19,652 --> 00:36:21,569
but now everybody knows
who Rumpelstiltskin is.

420
00:36:21,737 --> 00:36:23,363
Donkey, I've read the fine print.

421
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:25,865
There's nothing
about an exit clause in here.

422
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:27,951
Well, you didn't expect him
to make it easy for you.

423
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,370
Here, let me show you how it's done.

424
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:32,038
I didn't spend all that time
around them witches

425
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:33,873
without picking up a few tricks.

426
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:36,251
Your tiny, little ogre brain
couldn't begin to comprehend

427
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:38,712
the complexity
of my polygonic foldability skills.

428
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:40,130
What are you doing?

429
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:43,383
Hey, I can't get my origami on
unless you back off.

430
00:36:43,551 --> 00:36:46,845
Thank you. OK, here's what you
gotta do. You fold this piece here,

431
00:36:47,013 --> 00:36:49,389
make this letter match up here,
bring this corner here,

432
00:36:49,557 --> 00:36:53,727
and if you do it just right,
it will show you what to do. There!

433
00:36:53,894 --> 00:36:56,229
"Try Lou's Bliss. "

434
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:00,275
Who's Lou?

435
00:37:00,443 --> 00:37:02,235
Give me that!

436
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:09,617
"True Love's Kiss. "

437
00:37:11,912 --> 00:37:14,414
You have to take me to dinner first.

438
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:18,418
"According to fairy tale law,
if not fully satisfied,

439
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:22,088
true love's kiss will render
this contract null and void. "

440
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:25,759
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!

441
00:37:25,926 --> 00:37:30,722
If Fiona and I share true love's kiss,
I will get my life back!

442
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,808
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?

443
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:36,895
Well, that's just it, you see.

444
00:37:37,563 --> 00:37:38,938
I don't know.

445
00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:41,274
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.

446
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:43,777
So... where did you leave her last?

447
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:46,613
The last time I saw her,

448
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:49,449
I told her I wished
I'd never rescued her.

449
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:54,579
- Oh, no.
- Shrek?

450
00:37:54,747 --> 00:37:57,332
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!

451
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,626
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!

452
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:01,711
They keep dragons in there!

453
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:05,006
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!

454
00:38:05,174 --> 00:38:08,093
I'm gonna just hang back here
and find us some breakfast!

455
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,146
Fiona!

456
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:57,016
Oh, no.

457
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,238
If I didn't save Fiona...

458
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,909
...then who did?

459
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:30,258
This is the favour Fiona was
supposed to give me on the day we met.

460
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:33,928
It's a symbol of our love.

461
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:35,889
Now smell it!

462
00:39:36,056 --> 00:39:37,932
Hey, man, get that dirty
favour out of my face!

463
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,644
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife,

464
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,397
so stop complaining and start smelling.

465
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:46,024
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!

466
00:39:46,192 --> 00:39:47,901
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?

467
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:50,487
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!

468
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,406
If I was a dog, they'd call me Dog,
not Donkey!

469
00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:54,949
And another thing...

470
00:39:55,951 --> 00:39:57,410
Wait a minute.

471
00:39:58,078 --> 00:39:59,496
I think I got something.

472
00:40:00,122 --> 00:40:02,415
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.

473
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,209
Luscious and tasty.

474
00:40:04,376 --> 00:40:06,920
Hey! That's my wife
you're talking about.

475
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,589
Donkey!

476
00:40:13,594 --> 00:40:15,678
Yeah! Waffles!

477
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,806
And I thought the Waffle Fairy
was just a bedtime story.

478
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,936
Sticky stacks of golden,
syrupy deliciousness!

479
00:40:23,103 --> 00:40:25,271
Donkey! Don't eat that!

480
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:29,567
There's a stack of freshly made waffles
in the middle of the forest.

481
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:31,611
Don't you find that
a wee bit suspicious?

482
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,531
Oh, you... I'm just... What are you...?

483
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,658
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.

484
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:40,870
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.

485
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:42,830
You did.

486
00:40:49,964 --> 00:40:51,089
Look out!

487
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:55,218
Donkey!

488
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,804
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

489
00:40:59,974 --> 00:41:01,057
Donkey.

490
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,144
Help! Help me!

491
00:41:05,312 --> 00:41:08,064
Help, Shrek! Help!

492
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,047
Watch your head.

493
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,591
Hey, it's a new guy!

494
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,884
Look at him, all dressed up
in his Sunday vest.

495
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:38,803
He's really tiny, isn't he?

496
00:41:38,971 --> 00:41:41,055
Yeah. Fate has delivered us
a comrade-in-arms

497
00:41:41,223 --> 00:41:42,849
and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!

498
00:41:43,017 --> 00:41:44,976
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!

499
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,774
- Hey!
- Here you go.

500
00:41:57,072 --> 00:41:59,866
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?

501
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:03,620
We fight for freedom
and ogres everywhere!

502
00:42:13,088 --> 00:42:14,714
I didn't know we could do that.

503
00:42:14,882 --> 00:42:17,383
Help! You can't eat me! I got the mange!

504
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:22,013
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.

505
00:42:22,181 --> 00:42:24,599
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.

506
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:26,934
Trust me, you don't want
to eat this one.

507
00:42:27,102 --> 00:42:29,145
I go down smooth,
but come out fighting!

508
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:31,397
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.

509
00:42:31,565 --> 00:42:32,649
Your dinner is my friend!

510
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,942
- Come on, guys!
- I got to get the giblets out!

511
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,111
- She's back.
- There she is.

512
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:56,047
Fiona!

513
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,259
I'm so happy I found you!

514
00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:09,811
Maybe you missed orientation,

515
00:43:09,978 --> 00:43:13,481
but for future reference,
personal space is very important to me.

516
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:16,609
You don't know who I am, do you?

517
00:43:16,777 --> 00:43:18,277
No.

518
00:43:18,445 --> 00:43:20,446
Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away.

519
00:43:20,614 --> 00:43:22,782
Gather the others
and meet me in the war room.

520
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:25,451
Gretched, make sure everyone
is prepared to move out tonight.

521
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:27,578
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

522
00:43:27,746 --> 00:43:32,291
OK, I know you don't
remember me, but...

523
00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:34,544
...we're married. Hear me out.

524
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,463
And at the birthday party
with some pigs and a puppet,

525
00:43:37,631 --> 00:43:39,048
the villagers wanted me
to sign their pitchforks,

526
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:41,259
and this boy kept saying,
"Do the roar. "

527
00:43:41,427 --> 00:43:43,845
Then I punched the cakes that the
pigs ate and the next thing I knew,

528
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:46,347
my donkey fell in your waffle hole.

529
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:51,394
Right? Who's with me?

530
00:43:53,147 --> 00:43:55,773
I guess I must have kicked him
harder than I thought.

531
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:58,151
Fiona, I need to...

532
00:43:59,653 --> 00:44:02,155
Witches! All right, everyone,
you know the drill!

533
00:44:02,322 --> 00:44:04,157
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!

534
00:44:04,324 --> 00:44:06,409
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.

535
00:44:35,314 --> 00:44:38,107
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.

536
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:41,861
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.

537
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:46,616
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.

538
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:50,077
Well, I see who wears the chain mail
in your family!

539
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:58,252
Some people like to look
at the goblet as... as half empty.

540
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,423
Me, I like to look at it as half full.

541
00:45:03,258 --> 00:45:06,385
We've gone from the bottom
to the top, ladies.

542
00:45:06,553 --> 00:45:09,680
But we're not just an empire.

543
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:11,474
We're a family.

544
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:16,229
Everyone has got their cupcake?
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?

545
00:45:16,396 --> 00:45:17,396
Good.

546
00:45:17,564 --> 00:45:20,775
Yeah, you know, we have
put away a lot of ogres.

547
00:45:20,943 --> 00:45:25,112
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.

548
00:45:25,614 --> 00:45:27,698
It doesn't matter to me.

549
00:45:27,866 --> 00:45:30,618
It's not like it's the end of the world.

550
00:45:31,787 --> 00:45:34,705
Except... funny thing.

551
00:45:34,873 --> 00:45:38,376
Now that I think about it,
the ogre who got away is Shrek!

552
00:45:38,544 --> 00:45:41,379
And if he shares a kiss
with Fiona by sunrise,

553
00:45:41,547 --> 00:45:44,715
it is the end of the world! Our world!

554
00:45:44,883 --> 00:45:46,759
My empire!

555
00:45:50,305 --> 00:45:52,765
But, as I was saying,

556
00:45:52,933 --> 00:45:56,978
I like to look at the goblet
as half full.

557
00:45:58,438 --> 00:46:00,439
Yelling makes me so parched.

558
00:46:00,607 --> 00:46:04,443
Would anyone care for some water?
Wet your whistle?

559
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:07,488
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...

560
00:46:07,656 --> 00:46:10,825
...of agua purificada?

561
00:46:10,993 --> 00:46:13,327
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?

562
00:46:14,329 --> 00:46:16,330
Well, then does anyone care to tell me

563
00:46:16,498 --> 00:46:19,125
what it's going to take
to get this ogre? You.

564
00:46:19,293 --> 00:46:20,418
Faster brooms?

565
00:46:20,586 --> 00:46:22,169
- No!
- Pointier hats?

566
00:46:22,337 --> 00:46:23,963
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire

567
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:25,840
a professional bounty hunter?

568
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,844
What a world! What a world!

569
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:34,390
You know, actually
not a bad idea. Baba!

570
00:46:35,017 --> 00:46:36,642
I need a bounty hunter.

571
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:39,979
And if music doth
soothe the savage beast...

572
00:46:40,147 --> 00:46:43,357
...then I think I might know
just the person!

573
00:46:45,694 --> 00:46:49,947
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.

574
00:46:50,115 --> 00:46:53,284
Stiltskin is leading
tonight's ogre hunt himself.

575
00:46:53,452 --> 00:46:55,161
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?

576
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:57,163
I bet that's because of us.

577
00:46:57,331 --> 00:46:59,081
If that cupcake-eating clown

578
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:02,376
finally leaves the safety
of his filthy witch nest...

579
00:47:03,045 --> 00:47:04,337
...he'll be vulnerable.

580
00:47:04,504 --> 00:47:07,673
The plan's simple.
If they follow the usual patrol route,

581
00:47:07,841 --> 00:47:09,967
they'll reach the river by midnight.

582
00:47:10,135 --> 00:47:13,638
We'll be concealed along this road,
waiting for his caravan.

583
00:47:13,805 --> 00:47:17,141
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.

584
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:19,185
And then we attack!

585
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:28,194
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?

586
00:47:28,362 --> 00:47:29,654
That's my chimichanga stand.

587
00:47:30,739 --> 00:47:32,907
No, Cookie. We won't be needing that.

588
00:47:33,075 --> 00:47:36,786
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be
really hungry after this ambush, OK?

589
00:47:37,704 --> 00:47:39,497
Go and finish your little speech.

590
00:47:40,248 --> 00:47:43,709
All right, as I was saying,
when the smoke clears,

591
00:47:43,877 --> 00:47:47,588
Rumpelstiltskin is gone
and the chimichangas have been eaten.

592
00:47:47,756 --> 00:47:50,383
Far Far Away will finally be free.

593
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,301
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.

594
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:55,721
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.

595
00:47:58,058 --> 00:48:00,267
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.

596
00:48:00,435 --> 00:48:03,020
How am I ever gonna
get her to kiss me before sunrise?

597
00:48:03,188 --> 00:48:04,730
Actually, I was talking
about the revolution.

598
00:48:04,898 --> 00:48:06,399
Revolution?

599
00:48:06,566 --> 00:48:08,484
Why don't you just
tell her what you told me?

600
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:11,278
About how you're her true love and
you came from an alternate universe.

601
00:48:11,446 --> 00:48:13,239
Well, while I'm at it,
why don't I tell her

602
00:48:13,407 --> 00:48:15,408
that you're married
to a fire-breathing dragon

603
00:48:15,575 --> 00:48:18,619
and you have little, mutant
donkey-dragon babies.

604
00:48:19,121 --> 00:48:20,287
I do?!

605
00:48:20,455 --> 00:48:23,374
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

606
00:48:23,542 --> 00:48:24,750
I'm a daddy?

607
00:48:24,918 --> 00:48:28,295
You know what?
If I got Fiona to kiss me once...

608
00:48:30,298 --> 00:48:32,091
...then I can do it again.

609
00:48:32,968 --> 00:48:35,177
Shrek, do my babies
have hooves or talons?

610
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:36,929
Donkey...!

611
00:48:37,097 --> 00:48:38,514
Hello?

612
00:48:39,975 --> 00:48:41,142
Fiona?

613
00:48:47,149 --> 00:48:50,234
You should not be here, senor.

614
00:48:50,402 --> 00:48:51,777
Puss?

615
00:48:57,284 --> 00:48:58,993
You've gotta be kidding me.

616
00:49:12,841 --> 00:49:15,301
Feed me, if you dare.

617
00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:18,804
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...

618
00:49:20,182 --> 00:49:23,184
- ... fancy.
- Do I know you?

619
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:25,936
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?

620
00:49:26,104 --> 00:49:27,855
Your wee little boots?

621
00:49:28,023 --> 00:49:30,483
Boots? For a cat? Ha!

622
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,736
But you're Puss in Boots.

623
00:49:34,362 --> 00:49:35,946
Maybe once.

624
00:49:36,114 --> 00:49:37,656
But that is a name I have outgrown.

625
00:49:37,824 --> 00:49:39,492
That's not the only thing
you've outgrown.

626
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:43,746
Hey! I may have let myself go
a little since retirement,

627
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:46,499
but hanging up my sword
was the best decision of my life.

628
00:49:46,666 --> 00:49:49,710
I have all the cream I can drink
and all the mice I can chase.

629
00:49:51,338 --> 00:49:52,713
I'll get him later.

630
00:49:52,881 --> 00:49:55,299
Puss, what have I done to you?

631
00:49:55,467 --> 00:49:56,926
You've gone soft.

632
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:01,889
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.

633
00:50:03,058 --> 00:50:04,683
Look, it's not too late to fix it.

634
00:50:04,851 --> 00:50:07,103
All you have to do is help me
get a kiss from Fiona.

635
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:10,397
What are you doing?
Can I help you with something?

636
00:50:10,565 --> 00:50:13,526
Well, I know how stressful
mounting a rebellion can be...

637
00:50:13,693 --> 00:50:15,694
...rallying the troops,
planning attacks,

638
00:50:15,862 --> 00:50:19,657
so I brought you a little something
to ease the tension.

639
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,283
A gift basket?

640
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:24,078
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.

641
00:50:24,246 --> 00:50:26,622
Heart-shaped box of slugs.

642
00:50:27,249 --> 00:50:29,708
Skunk-scented candle.

643
00:50:29,876 --> 00:50:34,255
- Look, this really isn't the...
- What's this? Coupons!

644
00:50:34,422 --> 00:50:36,465
Let's see,
"Good for one free foot massage. "

645
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,968
"A mud facial!"
Oh, and here's one...

646
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:42,680
"Good for one free kiss. "
Let's cash it now.

647
00:50:42,848 --> 00:50:44,849
Look, I don't know
what this is all about,

648
00:50:45,016 --> 00:50:46,559
but I'm trying to run a revolution.

649
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:48,936
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,

650
00:50:49,104 --> 00:50:51,230
I suggest you take your gift basket,

651
00:50:51,398 --> 00:50:55,109
get out of my tent
and go make yourself useful!

652
00:50:55,777 --> 00:51:00,072
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.

653
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,284
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?

654
00:51:04,911 --> 00:51:05,953
An apologetic hug?

655
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,455
And a quick kiss goodbye.

656
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:10,958
Hey!

657
00:51:11,585 --> 00:51:13,752
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?

658
00:51:15,463 --> 00:51:18,841
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do
they make people feel uncomfortable?

659
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:22,136
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?

660
00:51:22,304 --> 00:51:26,515
Have the years of prim
and pampery made me soft?

661
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:29,602
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?

662
00:51:29,769 --> 00:51:31,353
I am.

663
00:51:39,154 --> 00:51:41,697
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.

664
00:51:42,991 --> 00:51:44,033
Honk.

665
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,784
All right, Piggies, be gone!

666
00:51:45,952 --> 00:51:48,162
Don't forget to take
her little potty box with you.

667
00:51:49,122 --> 00:51:51,081
This little piggy wants to go home!

668
00:51:51,249 --> 00:51:54,543
- Mr Stiltskin! He's here.
- Nice.

669
00:52:08,308 --> 00:52:11,477
Pied Piper. How was your commute?

670
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:14,647
Good.

671
00:52:14,814 --> 00:52:16,565
You call this guy a bounty hunter?

672
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:19,610
What's he gonna do,
flute those ogres a lullaby?

673
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:33,207
OK, got it!

674
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:36,543
Make it stop!

675
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,216
All right, that's enough.

676
00:52:45,553 --> 00:52:49,223
Looks like it's time to pay the piper.

677
00:52:51,393 --> 00:52:54,144
Griselda, seriously,
it's time to pay the piper.

678
00:52:54,312 --> 00:52:57,356
Now go get my chequebook!
Go! Move! Get out!

679
00:52:57,524 --> 00:52:59,525
Things are getting
real sloppy around here!

680
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,680
Here, now make sure they eat up!

681
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:08,242
You can't end tyranny on
an empty stomach! Go on! Go!

682
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:09,910
Din-din!

683
00:53:17,669 --> 00:53:20,546
- Come on, Donkey.
- One more time, please?

684
00:53:20,714 --> 00:53:23,007
All right, but this is the last time.

685
00:53:24,592 --> 00:53:25,592
Here it comes. Look at him.

686
00:53:30,932 --> 00:53:32,766
I see you!

687
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:41,567
That's quite a friend you've got there.

688
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:43,861
I can see why you haven't eaten him.

689
00:53:44,029 --> 00:53:46,655
Donkey! I hate to pull you away
from your adoring public,

690
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:49,116
but I'm not getting anywhere with Fiona.

691
00:53:49,284 --> 00:53:52,369
- I need your help!
- Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?

692
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,207
- Where'd you get these?
- Fiona's garbage.

693
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,294
Just another gift from some
clueless lover boy.

694
00:54:02,088 --> 00:54:03,756
That's a good one, Cookie!

695
00:54:04,758 --> 00:54:07,760
Anyone who knows Fiona knows
this stuff ain't gonna work on her.

696
00:54:07,927 --> 00:54:09,428
Works on me.

697
00:54:09,596 --> 00:54:12,473
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.

698
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,018
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing
Fiona cares about is her cause.

699
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:19,188
- To the cause!
- To the cause!

700
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:22,524
All right!

701
00:54:45,006 --> 00:54:46,006
Hello!

702
00:54:50,011 --> 00:54:52,096
- Nice moves.
- What are you doing?

703
00:54:52,263 --> 00:54:54,973
What does it look like?
I'm getting ready for ambush action.

704
00:54:55,141 --> 00:54:57,810
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes

705
00:54:57,977 --> 00:55:02,147
and do some scrunches
before an operational... op.

706
00:55:02,315 --> 00:55:03,357
This one taken?

707
00:55:03,525 --> 00:55:05,359
We use that to clean the toilets.

708
00:55:07,278 --> 00:55:10,406
And we use that one to clean
the thing we clean the toilets with.

709
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:11,865
I knew that.

710
00:55:12,951 --> 00:55:14,076
There you go, chief.

711
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:33,387
Hey... Scott?

712
00:55:33,888 --> 00:55:35,722
My name is Shrek, actually.

713
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:38,725
You're going to get yourself killed
at the ambush tonight.

714
00:55:38,893 --> 00:55:42,521
I'll be fine.
I think I can take care of myself...

715
00:55:43,022 --> 00:55:44,273
Well, let's see about that.

716
00:55:44,691 --> 00:55:47,151
Hey! Hey... Hey!

717
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:48,360
What the...?

718
00:55:53,074 --> 00:55:54,408
Fiona?

719
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:28,275
I got it.

720
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:29,943
Give me your hand.

721
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,989
The dragon goes under the bridge,

722
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,408
through the loop and finally...

723
00:56:36,576 --> 00:56:38,160
Into the castle.

724
00:56:46,794 --> 00:56:48,128
Wow.

725
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,965
OK. Good.

726
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:54,301
It seems like you can handle yourself.

727
00:56:54,469 --> 00:56:56,428
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!

728
00:56:56,596 --> 00:56:59,598
- I will, but Fiona...
- That's an order!

729
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:14,112
All right, let's get those axes
sharpened and weapons packed!

730
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,864
Preparation is half the battle!

731
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:21,495
Ogre! Un momento! Un momento!

732
00:57:21,996 --> 00:57:24,540
Ogre, ogre, un momento!

733
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:27,459
Just give me a minute.

734
00:57:27,627 --> 00:57:30,462
Look, Puss, I'm a little
pressed for time.

735
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:33,799
I am not believing
what I have just witnessed.

736
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:35,634
Back there, you and Fiona.

737
00:57:35,802 --> 00:57:38,470
There was a spark...
a spark inside her heart

738
00:57:38,638 --> 00:57:40,347
I thought was long extinguished.

739
00:57:40,515 --> 00:57:44,935
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!

740
00:57:45,103 --> 00:57:48,438
I am her true love. I ended her curse.

741
00:57:49,023 --> 00:57:50,857
You know of her curse?

742
00:57:51,025 --> 00:57:54,319
By day, one way, by night another.

743
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:57,239
This shall be the norm.

744
00:57:57,407 --> 00:58:00,909
Until you find true love's first kiss...

745
00:58:02,203 --> 00:58:06,081
...and then take love's true form.

746
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:08,834
You even know the little rhyme!

747
00:58:09,002 --> 00:58:11,503
It is true! You are the one!
You must prove it to her!

748
00:58:11,671 --> 00:58:13,839
- How?
- Convince her!

749
00:58:14,007 --> 00:58:15,340
Go to her when she is alone

750
00:58:15,508 --> 00:58:19,177
and tell her something
that only her true love would know.

751
00:58:19,345 --> 00:58:20,887
Know about what?!

752
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:26,018
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty!
Shrek, can we keep him?

753
00:58:42,744 --> 00:58:44,578
Excuse me. Coming through!

754
00:58:44,746 --> 00:58:47,456
Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.

755
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:50,500
Look, Donkey,
the chimichanga cart! Quick!

756
00:58:50,668 --> 00:58:53,545
Ãndale! After him, burro!
Donkey, vÃ¡monos!

757
00:58:53,713 --> 00:58:55,839
Man, you are a cat-astrophe!

758
00:58:56,007 --> 00:58:58,383
And you are ri-donkey-lous!

759
00:59:04,265 --> 00:59:07,059
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.

760
00:59:12,106 --> 00:59:13,982
Secure your positions!

761
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,876
- It's quite a view from up here.
- What are you doing?!

762
00:59:33,044 --> 00:59:34,086
Get back in position!

763
00:59:34,253 --> 00:59:37,339
You need to know,
once and for all, who I really am.

764
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:38,965
You are going to ruin everything!

765
00:59:39,133 --> 00:59:41,385
Ruin everything?
Actually, I'm gonna fix everything...

766
00:59:41,552 --> 00:59:44,262
The ogres, Rumpel, your curse.

767
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,516
How do you know about my curse?!

768
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:52,104
OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.

769
00:59:52,271 --> 00:59:54,815
I can explain everything.

770
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:01,113
- Where's Fiona's signal?
- What's she waiting for?

771
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,116
- He's going to get away!
- No, he's not.

772
01:00:29,684 --> 01:00:33,478
Listen, I don't know who you are
or how you know about my curse,

773
01:00:33,646 --> 01:00:35,522
but if any of these ogres
find out I'm...

774
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:38,942
- A beautiful princess?
- That is not who I am! Not anymore.

775
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:42,154
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You don't know anything about me.

776
01:00:42,321 --> 01:00:43,989
I know everything about you.

777
01:00:44,157 --> 01:00:47,159
I know you sing so beautifully
that birds explode.

778
01:00:47,326 --> 01:00:49,494
- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,

779
01:00:49,662 --> 01:00:52,330
- you put a heart over the "I".
- So what?

780
01:00:52,498 --> 01:00:54,499
I know that when
you see a shooting star,

781
01:00:54,667 --> 01:00:56,668
you cross your fingers on both hands,

782
01:00:56,836 --> 01:01:00,630
squinch up your nose
and you make a wish.

783
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:03,675
I know that you don't like the covers
wrapped around your feet,

784
01:01:03,843 --> 01:01:05,510
and I know that you sleep by candlelight

785
01:01:05,678 --> 01:01:07,679
because every time
you close your eyes...

786
01:01:08,723 --> 01:01:11,725
...you're afraid you're gonna
wake up back in that tower.

787
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:15,562
But, most importantly, Fiona...

788
01:01:16,564 --> 01:01:20,150
...I know that the reason
you turn human every day...

789
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:24,529
...is because you've
never been kissed...

790
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:27,073
...well...

791
01:01:29,577 --> 01:01:30,744
...by me.

792
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:44,216
- You move fast.
- It's not me doing the moving.

793
01:01:46,219 --> 01:01:48,386
- Why is this happening?!
- Love?

794
01:01:48,554 --> 01:01:51,681
- No, I'm being forced to dance!
- By love!

795
01:01:51,849 --> 01:01:54,601
No, I can't stop myself!

796
01:01:54,769 --> 01:01:57,604
Please! Make it stop!

797
01:01:57,772 --> 01:01:59,940
I can't control myself!

798
01:02:03,778 --> 01:02:06,905
Yeah! Cookie's bringing
the heat out of the kitchen!

799
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:11,618
Oh, no! It's the Piper!

800
01:02:13,788 --> 01:02:17,415
I can't believe I let this happen,
and it's all because of you!

801
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:22,003
- If you'd just let me kiss you!
- What? You're insane!

802
01:02:36,936 --> 01:02:41,022
We must do something before
they fandango themselves into oblivion!

803
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:44,609
- What can we do?
- First, you must stop dancing!

804
01:02:44,777 --> 01:02:47,487
When somebody tooties that flutey,
I got to shake my booty!

805
01:02:47,655 --> 01:02:49,281
Then it's up to me!

806
01:02:57,832 --> 01:03:01,668
Hurry! We must get them
away from the music!

807
01:03:04,005 --> 01:03:07,090
Puss and Donkey to the rescue!
We saved the day!

808
01:03:32,783 --> 01:03:35,285
Donkey... Can I borrow your tongue?

809
01:03:35,453 --> 01:03:36,536
Say what?!

810
01:03:37,496 --> 01:03:38,830
No. Hell...

811
01:03:41,292 --> 01:03:44,336
I don't care how big your eyes get,
player, it's not going down.

812
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:51,176
All right!

813
01:03:51,677 --> 01:03:52,677
Stop!

814
01:03:52,845 --> 01:03:55,347
- Where are you going?
- To save my friends.

815
01:03:55,514 --> 01:03:58,350
- How, by getting yourself killed?
- If that's what it takes.

816
01:03:58,517 --> 01:03:59,809
Puss, say something.

817
01:03:59,977 --> 01:04:01,853
- Puss?
- Let me explain.

818
01:04:02,021 --> 01:04:04,147
That's how you knew so much about me.

819
01:04:04,315 --> 01:04:07,400
- Fiona, wait! Kiss me.
- What?

820
01:04:07,568 --> 01:04:09,194
It's the only way to save your friends.

821
01:04:09,362 --> 01:04:10,320
Get out of my way.

822
01:04:10,488 --> 01:04:13,698
You used to believe that a single kiss
could solve everything!

823
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:44,521
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.

824
01:04:44,689 --> 01:04:47,315
True love's kiss
was supposed to fix everything!

825
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,567
Yeah, you know,
that's what they told me, too.

826
01:04:49,735 --> 01:04:52,070
True love didn't get me
out of that tower.

827
01:04:52,238 --> 01:04:54,948
I did. I saved myself.

828
01:04:56,117 --> 01:04:59,577
Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.

829
01:04:59,745 --> 01:05:02,163
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!

830
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:03,707
How would you know?

831
01:05:03,874 --> 01:05:06,584
Did you grow up locked away
in a dragon's keep?

832
01:05:06,752 --> 01:05:09,587
Did you live all alone
in a miserable tower?

833
01:05:09,755 --> 01:05:12,090
Did you cry yourself
to sleep every night,

834
01:05:12,258 --> 01:05:14,843
waiting for a true love
that never came?!

835
01:05:16,137 --> 01:05:19,723
But... But I'm your true love.

836
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:23,309
Then where were you
when I needed you?

837
01:05:35,156 --> 01:05:37,657
Maybe you kissed her wrong?

838
01:05:38,284 --> 01:05:39,325
No.

839
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:41,661
The kiss didn't work...

840
01:05:42,621 --> 01:05:44,956
...because Fiona doesn't love me.

841
01:05:51,505 --> 01:05:53,214
Don't despair, fellow ogres!

842
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:57,635
They can put us in cages,
but they can't cage our honour!

843
01:05:59,013 --> 01:06:01,931
Shrek and Fiona are together?!

844
01:06:04,018 --> 01:06:07,270
Yeah, I've heard enough of
your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it!

845
01:06:07,438 --> 01:06:09,105
Wolfie! My speech wig.

846
01:06:09,273 --> 01:06:13,526
Baba! Ready my makeup.
And Piper, pull my socks up.

847
01:06:15,988 --> 01:06:16,946
Tight.

848
01:06:17,114 --> 01:06:18,615
Attention, citizens.

849
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:23,703
Please stay tuned for a message
from our tyrannical dictator!

850
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:28,500
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...

851
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:30,752
...shepherd of your dreams.

852
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:35,548
Recently, a certain somebody

853
01:06:35,716 --> 01:06:39,052
has jeopardized our joyous lives.

854
01:06:40,012 --> 01:06:44,974
And that somebody
is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!

855
01:06:45,142 --> 01:06:47,435
That is why I come to you,
dear citizens.

856
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:50,105
For whomever brings me this ogre,

857
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:54,567
shall receive the deal of a lifetime.

858
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:56,361
Just think of it! Total and

859
01:06:56,529 --> 01:06:58,238
- complete happiness.
- Ya!

860
01:06:58,405 --> 01:07:01,866
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment!
All your greatest wishes.

861
01:07:02,034 --> 01:07:04,035
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.

862
01:07:04,203 --> 01:07:08,832
Anything you could ever want!
No strings attached!

863
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:12,210
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.

864
01:07:12,378 --> 01:07:18,216
So light your torches, sharpen
your pitchforks and get your mob on!

865
01:07:18,717 --> 01:07:21,761
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

866
01:07:26,016 --> 01:07:28,059
Go back where you came from!

867
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:32,856
It seems that we are safe.

868
01:07:33,023 --> 01:07:35,817
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky
and torchy out there. Let's go.

869
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:40,071
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.

870
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:43,241
Look, Shrek, I know things
might seem a little bleak right now,

871
01:07:43,409 --> 01:07:45,869
but things always work themselves
out in the end, you'll see.

872
01:07:46,036 --> 01:07:48,413
- I bet by this time tomorrow...
- Don't you understand?

873
01:07:48,581 --> 01:07:50,248
There is no tomorrow.

874
01:07:50,416 --> 01:07:54,377
There's no day after that, and there's
no day after that day after that!

875
01:07:54,545 --> 01:07:58,047
My life was perfect
and I'm never going to get it back!

876
01:07:58,215 --> 01:08:01,801
If your life was so perfect, why'd you
sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?

877
01:08:01,969 --> 01:08:05,346
Because I didn't know
what I had until it was gone! All right?

878
01:08:10,144 --> 01:08:11,978
I didn't know what I had.

879
01:08:14,565 --> 01:08:18,067
Surrender now! I'm taking you in!

880
01:08:18,652 --> 01:08:22,238
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!

881
01:08:22,406 --> 01:08:23,406
Gingy?

882
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,618
- You unhand me, green devil!
- What are you doing?

883
01:08:26,785 --> 01:08:28,077
Collecting my bounty!

884
01:08:28,245 --> 01:08:30,246
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?

885
01:08:30,998 --> 01:08:33,458
Rumpelstiltskin promised
the deal of a lifetime

886
01:08:33,626 --> 01:08:36,628
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?

887
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:39,839
Where all your wishes come true.

888
01:08:41,508 --> 01:08:42,842
Wait a minute.

889
01:08:43,636 --> 01:08:46,346
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?

890
01:08:46,513 --> 01:08:50,808
You know what? I'm gonna give
Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants.

891
01:08:50,976 --> 01:08:53,311
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...

892
01:08:57,691 --> 01:08:59,692
Were you going to eat that?

893
01:09:01,695 --> 01:09:04,781
Not Shrek. That is not Shrek.
Also not Shrek.

894
01:09:04,949 --> 01:09:08,284
That's not even an ogre,
it is a troll! Nice try.

895
01:09:08,452 --> 01:09:09,452
- And that...
- Roar.

896
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,620
...is just sad.

897
01:09:11,497 --> 01:09:13,373
And what is that supposed to be?

898
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:15,124
I'm just a frightened old man.

899
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:18,211
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!

900
01:09:18,379 --> 01:09:20,004
That is your father painted green.

901
01:09:20,172 --> 01:09:22,215
No, it's Shrek! Honest!

902
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:24,801
Take them away!

903
01:09:24,969 --> 01:09:27,845
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?

904
01:09:28,013 --> 01:09:30,723
How hard can it be?!
I want him! I want him! I want him!

905
01:09:31,225 --> 01:09:32,558
Stiltskin!

906
01:09:34,144 --> 01:09:35,853
I hear you're looking for me.

907
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:38,648
All right! Finally!

908
01:09:38,816 --> 01:09:42,277
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?

909
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:44,279
- I do.
- What? But...

910
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:48,366
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.

911
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:55,123
That means you have
to give me anything I want.

912
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,875
No! Only true love's kiss
can break your contract!

913
01:09:58,043 --> 01:09:59,919
So if you thought you were just gonna...

914
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:05,216
- ... in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.

915
01:10:05,759 --> 01:10:08,177
Then what do you want?

916
01:10:18,939 --> 01:10:21,441
The ogres. They are all free.

917
01:10:21,608 --> 01:10:23,109
But where is Shrek?

918
01:10:28,282 --> 01:10:30,616
This is not good.

919
01:10:31,744 --> 01:10:35,246
I don't know.
Not much of a storybook ending.

920
01:10:35,414 --> 01:10:41,252
The noble Shrek turns himself in
to save a bunch of filthy ogres.

921
01:10:41,795 --> 01:10:44,464
All that matters is that they're free...

922
01:10:44,965 --> 01:10:46,966
...and Fiona is safe.

923
01:10:48,469 --> 01:10:51,429
I bet Fiona would be
really touched to hear that.

924
01:10:52,097 --> 01:10:53,389
But, hey...

925
01:10:53,557 --> 01:10:56,476
...I guess you can tell her yourself.

926
01:10:57,311 --> 01:10:58,770
Fiona!

927
01:11:07,154 --> 01:11:11,449
Stiltskin, we had a deal!
You agreed to free all ogres!

928
01:11:11,617 --> 01:11:12,867
Oh, yeah.

929
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:17,663
But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?

930
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:26,464
By day, one way, by night, another.
Blardy, blardy, blar.

931
01:11:28,342 --> 01:11:30,551
Nobody's smart but me!

932
01:11:38,685 --> 01:11:41,187
That was a really brave thing
you did, Shrek.

933
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:42,980
Thank you.

934
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:46,025
No, you were right.

935
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,986
I wasn't there for you.

936
01:11:49,154 --> 01:11:51,489
And not just at
the Dragon's Keep, but...

937
01:11:52,825 --> 01:11:54,575
...every day since.

938
01:11:55,536 --> 01:11:56,702
Well...

939
01:11:57,704 --> 01:11:59,330
...you're here now.

940
01:12:02,042 --> 01:12:03,835
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!

941
01:12:04,002 --> 01:12:05,378
Don't be a fool, mule!

942
01:12:05,546 --> 01:12:08,047
She's right. Rumpel's palace
is locked up tighter

943
01:12:08,215 --> 01:12:11,509
- than Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
- And that cupboard wasn't guarded

944
01:12:11,677 --> 01:12:14,679
by a whole bunch of
mean, ugly, nasty witches.

945
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,723
Hey! We can hear you!

946
01:12:18,559 --> 01:12:20,059
Sorry!

947
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,354
We must get into the palace.

948
01:12:23,522 --> 01:12:25,648
Man, Shrek and me
just busted out of that place!

949
01:12:25,816 --> 01:12:27,358
But how?

950
01:12:28,569 --> 01:12:31,529
The same way we're gonna bust in.

951
01:12:35,993 --> 01:12:40,121
Yay! My new pretty ball!
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?

952
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:41,873
I guess it'll have to do.

953
01:12:47,337 --> 01:12:52,049
Witches, finally, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

954
01:12:52,217 --> 01:12:55,011
The main event of the evening!

955
01:12:55,179 --> 01:12:58,347
I present Shrek and Fiona!

956
01:13:03,437 --> 01:13:07,482
And now, to put the past
behind us once and for all,

957
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:11,402
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!

958
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:15,156
Fiona's old flame,
the keeper of the keep...

959
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:16,908
...Dragon!

960
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:42,183
- Donkey?
- And Puss!

961
01:13:45,979 --> 01:13:47,104
In Boots!

962
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:19,262
Get them, get them, witches!

963
01:14:21,098 --> 01:14:22,640
Incoming!

964
01:14:26,853 --> 01:14:29,230
- Donkey, woo her!
- Woo who?

965
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:30,773
Your wife!

966
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:55,965
Uh-oh.

967
01:15:01,471 --> 01:15:04,765
I'll call you! We're in love!

968
01:15:16,528 --> 01:15:17,987
Fiona, hold on!

969
01:15:19,698 --> 01:15:21,324
Hey, you!

970
01:15:50,854 --> 01:15:53,939
- Chimichangas?!
- Get 'em while they're hot!

971
01:16:00,864 --> 01:16:02,073
Jump!

972
01:16:05,535 --> 01:16:06,744
Now!

973
01:16:20,801 --> 01:16:23,427
The dragon goes under the bridge!

974
01:16:24,554 --> 01:16:26,055
Through the loop!

975
01:16:26,223 --> 01:16:27,306
And finally...

976
01:16:27,474 --> 01:16:29,058
Into the castle!

977
01:16:35,732 --> 01:16:37,108
Run!

978
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,573
Foo!

979
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:47,743
So long!

980
01:16:50,622 --> 01:16:51,747
Come on, Fifi, go!

981
01:16:51,915 --> 01:16:53,791
Go! Witches, close up the floor!

982
01:16:54,918 --> 01:16:57,545
Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap!

983
01:16:57,713 --> 01:17:01,090
Come on, go! Fly away! Up, up! Go!

984
01:17:01,925 --> 01:17:03,259
Fifi, no!

985
01:17:08,014 --> 01:17:09,932
Victory is ours!

986
01:17:18,316 --> 01:17:21,318
Looks like we're having
curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

987
01:17:21,486 --> 01:17:24,071
Hey, we make a pretty good team.

988
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,198
You have no idea.

989
01:17:34,124 --> 01:17:35,458
Shrek?

990
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:41,130
His day is up. His day is...!

991
01:17:41,715 --> 01:17:42,882
Shrek?

992
01:17:43,967 --> 01:17:45,634
It's all right.

993
01:17:49,181 --> 01:17:51,474
There has to be something I can do.

994
01:17:52,309 --> 01:17:55,936
You've already done
everything for me, Fiona.

995
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:58,689
You gave me a home and a family.

996
01:17:58,857 --> 01:18:00,608
You have kids?

997
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:02,777
We have kids.

998
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:06,822
Fergus, Farkle
and a little girl named...

999
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:08,324
- ... Felicia.
- Felicia.

1000
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:11,994
I always wanted to have
a daughter named Felicia.

1001
01:18:12,537 --> 01:18:14,205
And someday...

1002
01:18:15,874 --> 01:18:17,208
...you will.

1003
01:18:27,886 --> 01:18:30,554
You know what the
best part of today was?

1004
01:18:33,183 --> 01:18:37,353
I got the chance to fall in love
with you all over again.

1005
01:19:11,263 --> 01:19:14,098
Fiona, the sunrise!

1006
01:19:14,266 --> 01:19:16,559
You're still... an ogre!

1007
01:19:19,062 --> 01:19:22,022
- True love's form.
- Impossible!

1008
01:19:22,774 --> 01:19:24,441
The kiss worked.

1009
01:19:31,116 --> 01:19:32,449
What?!

1010
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:43,294
Fifi!

1011
01:19:45,088 --> 01:19:46,422
Puss!

1012
01:19:48,758 --> 01:19:50,509
No, no, no!

1013
01:19:50,677 --> 01:19:53,762
No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!

1014
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:09,361
I love you, Daddy!

1015
01:20:09,529 --> 01:20:12,781
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

1016
01:20:17,203 --> 01:20:20,414
Everybody, I have found another cake!

1017
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:23,459
Shrek? Are you OK?

1018
01:20:29,966 --> 01:20:34,136
Fiona. I've never been better.

1019
01:20:36,306 --> 01:20:37,973
Roar!

1020
01:20:42,812 --> 01:20:45,147
Happy Birthday, Farkle.

1021
01:20:45,315 --> 01:20:47,608
Fergus, my little man!

1022
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:50,069
And Felicia, sweetheart.

1023
01:20:50,236 --> 01:20:52,488
I believe this is yours.

1024
01:20:53,865 --> 01:20:55,532
Thank you, Daddy.

1025
01:20:57,035 --> 01:20:59,536
Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about
giving my babies an encore!

1026
01:20:59,704 --> 01:21:01,830
Please, seÃ±or, let us have it!

1027
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:16,595
- I didn't know we could do that.
- That's my best friend!

1028
01:21:17,847 --> 01:21:20,015
You know, I always thought

1029
01:21:20,183 --> 01:21:22,559
that I rescued you
from the Dragon's Keep.

1030
01:21:22,727 --> 01:21:24,103
You did.

1031
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:27,856
No. It was you that rescued me.

1032
01:22:58,948 --> 01:23:00,282
Yummy!
