1
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,233
<i>There was a time above.</i>

2
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,754
<i>A time before.</i>

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,713
<i>There were perfect things,</i>

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,149
<i>diamond absolutes.</i>

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,435
<i>How things fall.</i>

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,033
<i>Things on Earth.</i>

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,792
<i>And what falls...</i>

8
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,600
Master Wayne!

9
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,152
<i>- ... is fallen.</i>
- Bruce!

10
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,472
<i>Bruce, it's all right.</i>

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,279
<i>Bruce, please.</i>

12
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,711
Martha.

13
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,598
<i>In the dream,
they took me to the light.</i>

14
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,591
<i>A beautiful lie.</i>

15
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,108
<i>- Jack.</i>
- Bruce.

16
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,713
Jack, listen to me.

17
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,120
I want you to get everyone
out of the building right now.

18
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,079
<i>- You understand?</i>
- Oh, my God.

19
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,456
<i>Stay away from the windows!</i>

20
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,600
Let's go. Come on.
Start moving now, people. Let's go.

21
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,399
The boss wants us out of the building,
so let's make it happen.

22
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,476
Jack. Jack!

23
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,016
<i>We're sorry.</i>

24
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,351
<i>All circuits are busy now.
Will you please try your call again later?</i>

25
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,353
Heavenly God,

26
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,117
creator of Heaven and Earth,

27
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,629
have mercy on my soul.

28
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,629
Jack!

29
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,918
Buddy hands! Everybody show me! Good job!

30
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,187
Come on, guys.

31
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,318
<i>Hold on tight.</i>

32
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,919
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

33
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,519
Go.

34
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,828
<i>Mr. Wayne!</i>

35
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,951
Mr. Wayne! I can't feel my legs.

36
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,696
I can't feel my legs.

37
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,559
We need help over here!

38
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,438
Help me. I can't feel my legs.

39
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,192
You're gonna be okay. You hear me?

40
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,315
Wallace?
What do they call you, Wally? Huh?

41
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,595
You're the boss, boss.

42
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,429
All right. You're gonna be okay.

43
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,952
Easy, easy. Come on.

44
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,719
<i>Oh, my God.
I can't move my leg.</i>

45
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,669
My God. I can't feel my legs.

46
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,990
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

47
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:28,311
You're okay. All right? Huh?

48
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,120
You know what? We're gonna find your mom.

49
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,629
Where is she?

50
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:37,590
All that wind is bad luck.
Blood in the sky.

51
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,475
Oh, there she is!

52
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,115
Miss Lane.

53
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,638
<i>Miss Lane. Jimmy Olsen.</i>

54
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,630
Photographer. Obviously.

55
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,352
Where's Heron?

56
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,913
Uh, trouble at the border.

57
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,317
So, uh, how'd you land it?
This is, like, pioneer stuff.

58
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,710
Amajagh's never given an interview.

59
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,837
You know what Heron always
says when we're on assignment together?

60
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,633
Not a goddamn thing.

61
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,708
I like Heron.

62
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,668
Let's go.

63
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,389
<i>Passports.
Electronics. Phones. Camera.</i>

64
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,869
Your fixer said that
the general approved photos.

65
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,955
Are you a terrorist, General?

66
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:15,191
They did not tell me the interview
was with a lady.

67
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,793
I'm not a lady. I'm a journalist.

68
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,312
<i>What I am
is a man with nothing</i>

69
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,076
<i>except a love of my people.</i>

70
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,788
Who's paying for these
security contractors, General?

71
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,681
Who pays for the drones
that pass over our heads at night?

72
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,216
<i>One question begs another.</i>

73
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,389
<i>Yes?</i>

74
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,597
<i>Say what you're saying, General.</i>

75
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,158
It's just a camera.

76
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,630
The United States
has declared its neutrality

77
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,919
in your country's civil war

78
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,149
both in policy and in principle.

79
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:49,480
Don't open... You just exposed...

80
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:54,075
These pious American fictions...

81
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,831
<i>...spoken like truth.</i>

82
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay. That's my film.

83
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:06,994
Men with power obey
neither policy nor principle, Miss Lane.

84
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,434
<i>No one is different.</i>

85
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,556
No one is neutral.

86
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,399
CIA.

87
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,874
They're tracking us!

88
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,679
You!

89
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,788
You're CIA?

90
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,187
What? No. No!

91
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,475
- You brought him here!
- No, he's a photographer.

92
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,559
No!

93
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,198
It's okay, Lois.

94
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,080
Talon's down, sir.

95
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,519
Python, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

96
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,789
Repeat, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

97
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,832
There's still a civilian in
the compound. We'll extract her.

98
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,798
<i>Negative. RPA to engage.
Stand down and get black.</i>

99
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,113
There'll be friendlies
in the blast zone, so...

100
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,719
Call off the goddamn drone.

101
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,999
Stand down is an order. Python?

102
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,595
Let's move!

103
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:37,914
I...

104
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,519
I didn't know.

105
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,875
Ignorance is not the same as innocence,

106
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,713
Miss Lane.

107
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,514
Get up! Stand up!

108
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,591
Quickly. He's coming.

109
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,078
Inbound 2 mikes.

110
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,995
<i>Passing Python now.</i>

111
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,428
Move out!

112
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,910
- Target locked.
- You are clear to engage.

113
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,874
Armed hot and in range.

114
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,837
<i>Three.</i>

115
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,996
Two. One.

116
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,913
Link's been hit.

117
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,552
By what?

118
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,197
Take one step,
you will see the inside of her head.

119
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,913
<i>The women
in the village heard a noise.</i>

120
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,669
Like the sky cracked open.

121
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,795
He came down. Then came fire.

122
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,711
<i>Even worse came after.</i>

123
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,358
<i>The government attacked.</i>

124
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,155
<i>No mercy in the villages.</i>

125
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:30,271
My parents tried to run.

126
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,111
The world has been so caught up
with what Superman can do

127
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:41,073
that no one has asked what he should do.

128
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,991
Let the record show that this
committee holds him responsible.

129
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,111
<i>He'll never answer to you.</i>

130
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,750
He answers to no one.
Not even, I think, to God.

131
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,148
<i>58 to nothing.</i>

132
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:00,470
<i>Metropolis, again,
blowing out Gotham City.</i>

133
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,695
<i>Really, only the diehards
are left in the stands.</i>

134
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,455
<i>Delta Charlie 27.
Reports of screams coming from vacant home</i>

135
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,198
<i>at 1939 Harborway.</i>

136
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,855
<i>Tom, it's been great
working with you.</i>

137
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,519
<i>I want to thank our
producer and director.</i>

138
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,135
<i>- Now wait a second.
- I don't even want to suggest...</i>

139
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,615
<i>Delta Charlie 27, respond.</i>

140
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Just take a knee.

141
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,576
<i>They're lining up as if
Clarkson is gonna throw it deep here.</i>

142
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,935
<i>- Don't tell me, Dave.
- Going to the end zone!</i>

143
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,655
<i>- This is unnecessary.
- Delta Charlie 27.</i>

144
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,672
<i>Zeke Baker is open.
Baker with a touchdown catch!</i>

145
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,215
<i>I can't believe
I just watched that.</i>

146
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,390
<i>Delta Charlie 27.
Do you copy?</i>

147
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,627
10-4. We're on it.

148
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,676
<i>And now
a fight breaks out.</i>

149
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,190
<i>Gotham City, you know
how they are about their football team.</i>

150
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,153
<i>Things could get ugly
in the city tonight.</i>

151
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,314
Go.

152
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,154
It's okay.

153
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:35,875
It's okay.

154
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,920
We're gonna help.
We're here to help.

155
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,469
We're gonna get you out of here. Okay?

156
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,113
I don't understand.

157
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,557
<i>Please don't.
Please don't.</i>

158
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,395
<i>Please. I don't know who he is.</i>

159
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,999
<i>I don't know who he is!</i>

160
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,997
<i>No!</i>

161
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,907
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

162
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Christ!

163
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,512
I saw him.

164
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,557
<i>I never saw him before.
I... I didn't know.</i>

165
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,153
You almost took my face off.

166
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,355
How about you don't shoot
the good guys, huh?

167
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,797
Oh. Oh.

168
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,911
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

169
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,718
<i>He branded him.</i>

170
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,875
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,432
I was gonna cook.

172
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,153
Surprise you.

173
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,596
They held hearings about what happened.

174
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,256
<i>- They're saying that...</i>
- I don't care.

175
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,270
I don't care what they're saying.

176
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,240
The woman I love could have
been blown up or shot.

177
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,016
<i>Think of what could have happened.</i>

178
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,348
Well, think about what did happen.

179
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,795
I didn't kill those men,
if that's what they think.

180
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,096
If that's what you're saying.

181
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,792
No, I'm saying
I want to understand what happened.

182
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,711
I'm saying thank you for saving my life.

183
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,632
<i>I'm saying there's a cost.</i>

184
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,476
I just don't know if it's possible.

185
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,199
Don't know if what's possible?

186
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,153
For you to love me and be you.

187
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,073
Clark!

188
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,269
Clark, you're going
to flood the apartment.

189
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,391
Mmm-hmm.

190
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
You still working?

191
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,949
You're getting slow
in your old age, Alfred.

192
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:19,076
Comes to us all, Master Wayne.

193
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,476
Even you got too old to die young.

194
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,789
And not for lack of trying.

195
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,336
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar.
Funnel-ferry butterbar.</i>

196
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,776
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar. Funnel-ferry...</i>

197
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,440
There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.

198
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,550
It's this new layer of armor.

199
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,159
I'll just have to rewire.

200
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:45,509
So, last night was productive?

201
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,997
No. He's too low-level. He knew nothing.

202
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,270
This is the man who knows things.

203
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,471
Anatoli Knyazev. He's Russian.

204
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,439
Contracts all over the globe,

205
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:00,096
<i>but he's based out of the port of Gotham.</i>

206
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,633
<i>Weapons and human trafficking.</i>

207
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,559
<i>So the White Portuguese
is a Russian.</i>

208
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,919
That's the theory.

209
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:10,114
No. The theory is that the Russian
will lead me to the man himself.

210
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,272
If he is, indeed, a "him."

211
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:17,397
You don't even know if he exists.
Could be a phantasm.

212
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,630
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?

213
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,471
Ah, high-stakes round.

214
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,278
<i>New rules.</i>

215
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,112
We're criminals, Alfred.

216
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,395
We've always been criminals.
Nothing's changed.

217
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,748
Oh, yes, it has, sir.

218
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,833
Everything's changed.

219
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,392
<i>Men fall from the sky.</i>

220
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,829
The gods hurl thunderbolts.

221
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,031
<i>Innocents die.</i>

222
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,112
<i>That's how it starts, sir.</i>

223
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,150
<i>The fever. The rage.</i>

224
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:03,153
The feeling of powerlessness.

225
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:08,752
It turns good men cruel.

226
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,634
<i>John, get D.</i>

227
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:25,796
Ooh. Ah. Ahoy, ahoy!
I did not know you were here.

228
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,836
- Man on the marquee.
- Yeah, don't believe it.

229
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,375
My father named the company
after himself.

230
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
He was the Lex in front of the Corp.
How you doin'?

231
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,634
Really great.

232
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,519
Really great? Good. Good.
Uh, follow me.

233
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,432
No, uh, Dad started saying
that he named the company,

234
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,153
after his kid at investor pitches.

235
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,559
Rich old ladies.
They thought it was very cute, you know?

236
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,317
"Write checks for Lex."

237
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:47,590
You know, Dad was born in East Germany.

238
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,915
He grew up eating stale crackers.

239
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,160
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade

240
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:54,197
and wave flowers at tyrants.

241
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:58,068
So, I think it was providence
that his son, me,

242
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,388
would end up with this.

243
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:02,067
One of my Rebuild Metropolis
crews found it.

244
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,673
<i>Little souvenir from
the Kryptonian World Engine.</i>

245
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,839
What does a rock have to do
with homeland security?

246
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,551
Homeland security? Hmm.

247
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,393
No, no, no, ma'am, planetary security.

248
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,269
<i>The fragment
is of a radioactive xenomineral.</i>

249
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,670
<i>We suspected it might
have bio-interactions,</i>

250
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:18,750
so we took the sample to AMRIID,

251
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,277
where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.

252
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,916
And, when we exposed
General Zod to the mineral,

253
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,307
this happened.

254
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,271
<i>Profound biodegradation.
Decaying Kryptonian cells.</i>

255
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,016
We concluded the mineral
could be weaponized

256
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,440
if a large enough sample was found.

257
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:39,830
And then, among the fishes, a whale.

258
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
<i>Ah!</i>

259
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:43,556
<i>Lying at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.</i>

260
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,479
Emerald City.

261
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,352
<i>Beautiful.</i>

262
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:49,748
<i>Now, Rocky is radioactive,</i>

263
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,116
but what he needs from you
is an import license.

264
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,634
And why would we want to
weaponize this material?

265
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,839
<i>As a deterrent.</i>

266
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,455
A silver bullet to keep in reserve,
to use against the Kryptonians,

267
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,833
so the day does not come, madam,

268
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,359
when your children are waving
daisies at a reviewing stand.

269
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,952
Last I looked, the only one of those

270
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,758
flying around up here was Superman.

271
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,957
Ha-ha, yes. Superman.
Yeah, but there are...

272
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,119
<i>There are more of them.</i>

273
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,473
The metahuman thesis.

274
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,953
<i>Yes, the metahuman thesis.</i>

275
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:15,394
<i>More likely than not</i>

276
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,431
these exceptional beings live among us.

277
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,789
The basis of our myths.
Gods among men upon

278
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,518
our little blue planet here.

279
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,111
Now, you don't have to use
a silver bullet.

280
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,390
But if you forge one...

281
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,952
Well, then

282
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,474
we don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.

283
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,515
There are ways we can help each other.

284
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,950
Would you step
into my office here?

285
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,147
Yes.

286
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,397
What's your wish list?

287
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,992
Access to the wreck of
the crashed Kryptonian ship?

288
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,189
Done.

289
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,232
The complete remains
of the dead alien for testing.

290
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,067
You want Zod's body?

291
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,319
Okay.

292
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,229
Mmm.

293
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,907
It's cherry.

294
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,239
Mmm-mmm.

295
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,873
<i>Because the time has come</i>

296
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:46,197
<i>for the world to hear
the other side of the story.</i>

297
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:49,590
<i>They say that Superman is a hero.
Okay, but whose hero?</i>

298
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,910
<i>If Superman
were here right now,</i>

299
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,479
<i>what would you want to say to him?</i>

300
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:56,111
<i>That my family,
too, had dreams.</i>

301
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:02,636
<i>To look him in his eye
and ask him how he decides</i>

302
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,752
<i>which lives count.</i>

303
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,192
<i>And which ones do not.</i>

304
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,873
Sir, get down.

305
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,914
Sir, I said get down!

306
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,273
<i>Now!</i>

307
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,552
<i>Can we get some backup here?</i>

308
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,831
<i>Hey! Hey! Don't do it!</i>

<i>That carries up to 40 years in prison.</i>

No, she's been gone.

I'm not a cop. I'm a reporter.

337

The young lady living here...

She hasn't been back.

339

In fact, if she's smart,
then she's got out of this city.

Scared of who?

There's a new kind of mean in him.

346

He is angry.

The house treats luck like an insult.

354

Good luck for one is always
his brother's misfortune.

355

Three nights with a Bolshoi ballerina,

356
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,958
that line was all she taught me.

361
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,815

<i>Poor people don't buy papers?</i>

368

Perry, when you assign a story,

369
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,559
you're making a choice about who matters.

370

And who's worth it.

371
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,793
Good morning, Smallville.

372
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,588
The American conscience died
with Robert, Martin, and John.

373

<i>Sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

374
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:37,836
No match. My guys in the crime lab
never seen one before.

375
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,436
It's called a bullet.
You shoot people with them.

376
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,432
Recovered from the scene
of the firefight in the desert.

<i>So?</i>

380
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,072
So who gave prototype military rounds

to Tuareg fighters in the Sahara?

382
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,318
You're the reporter. Tell me.

383
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,175
I think that the US government
is arming the rebels

384
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:58,016
<i>while claiming to support
the elected government.</i>

Flight to D.C. tonight.
Couple of days there.

387
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,798
Go.

388
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,996
Coach. No extra legroom.

389
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,954
Economy plus.

390
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,155
Coach!

391
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,670
So, why didn't you tell me?

392
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,114
You're digging up snakes, Lo.

393
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,833
It's kind of dangerous.

394
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,911
That is why I didn't tell you.

395
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:29,880
Lane, don't you
have a plane to catch?

396
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,635
Yes, sir.

397
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,628
Benefit for the Library of Metropolis.

398
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,711
Someone on the committee
requested that Clark Kent cover it.

399
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,791
Probably some old charity crone
who's got a thing for nerds.

400
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,514
<i>Senator.</i>

401
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,199
Little bourbon before lunch?

402
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,315
My driver's outside. I can't stay.

403
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,708
No bourbon?

404
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,753
Kentucky girl like yourself?

405
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
Hmm.

406
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,237
My dad always said that Kentucky mash

407
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,351
was the secret to health.

408
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:10,952
Mmm.

409
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,353
This was his room.

410
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,952
I kept it just the same.

411
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,360
Mmm.

412
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:26,630
"Maybe one day Dad'll come back
if I just keep everything the same."

413
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,393
That is silly.

414
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,434
The magical thinking of orphan boys.

415
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:35,034
I'm blocking the import
license for your mineral.

416
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,552
The redcapes are coming.

417
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:48,150
The redcapes are coming.

418
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:49,829
Hmm...

419
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,119
You and your hearings.

420
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,639
Galloping through the streets to warn us.

421
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:05,797
One if by land, two if by air.

422
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:07,108
Mmm.

423
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,956
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

424
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,159
Can I call you June?

425
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,798
You can call me whatever you like.

426
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,672
Take a bucket of piss and
call it Granny's Peach Tea.

427
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Mmm-hmm.

428
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:25,958
Take a weapon of assassination
and call it deterrence.

429
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:29,753
You won't fool a fly or me.

430
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,353
I'm not gonna drink it.

431
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,755
You don't think Dad would mind, do you?

432
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,675
If I changed just...
Just one thing in this room?

433
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:50,434
Because that should be upside-down.

434
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:54,630
We know better now, don't we?

435
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,876
The devils don't come
from Hell beneath us. No.

436
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,313
No, they come from the sky.

437
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:58,239
Oh.

438
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,277
I hope the next generation of Waynes

439
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,510
won't inherit an empty wine cellar.

440
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,476
Not that there's likely
to be a next generation.

441
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,795
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

442
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,271
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.

443
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:19,114
Two mentions of business
with the White Portuguese.

444
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,072
And it's continually
transmitting blacked-out data

445
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,317
to the personal residence
of Alexander Luthor.

446
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,755
You think Lex Luthor
is the White Portuguese?

447
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,789
I can't see that he needs the income
from imported arms.

448
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,376
Regardless, I'll need to put
a leech at his house,

449
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,548
and I'm gonna need the suit.

450
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:38,675
The Bat interrogated six people

451
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,672
and came away with nothing.

452
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,630
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.

453
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,797
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.

454
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,472
Bruce Wayne won't have to.

455
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,918
He's been invited.

456
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,079
Who's that?

457
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,755
You must be new to
the "let them eat cake" beat.

458
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,512
That is Bruce Wayne.

459
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,829
<i>Philanthropist, bibliophile...</i>

00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:20,639
Mr. Lex Luthor.

00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,552
<i>You're embarrassing me.
Um...</i>

465
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:33,592
<i>Speech, speech. Uh...</i>

466
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,429
<i>Blah, blah, blah. Uh...</i>

467
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:37,599
<i>Open bar.</i>

468
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:39,992
<i>The end.</i>

469
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,152
<i>Uh...</i>

470
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:45,992
The word "philanthropist"
comes from the Greek.

471
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:47,797
Meaning a lover of humanity.

472
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:50,909
<i>It was coined about 2,500 years ago.</i>

473
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:52,637
All right. Where am I going, Alfred?

474
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,791
Go past the elevator.

475
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,278
Do a left.

476
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,235
<i>That's right, must be.</i>

477
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,110
<i>It's in the service corridor
in the basement.</i>

478
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,632
<i>Go down the stairs.</i>

479
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,393
<i>Gods and men.
Prometheus went with us.</i>

480
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:08,119
And he ruined Zeus' plan
to destroy mankind,

481
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,920
and for that he was given a thunderbolt.

482
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:13,155
<i>Hmm, that seems unfair.</i>

483
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:16,150
<i>On a serious note,
the Library of Metropolis...</i>

484
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,295
Go to the stairs. You saw them
on your way in. Down the stairs.

485
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,471
<i>But at one time,
Dad could not buy them. No.</i>

486
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:23,135
<i>My father could not afford
books growing up.</i>

487
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:25,559
<i>He had to root through the garbage
for yesterday's newspaper.</i>

488
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,880
All right.
You got the kitchens on your right.

489
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,278
<i>Do a left.</i>

490
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,440
Right in front of you.
That's where you want to be.

491
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:51,992
May I help you, Mr. Wayne?

492
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:54,639
I just...

493
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,355
I thought the bathroom was down here.
I must have...

494
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:01,516
That last martini was
two too many, I think.

495
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:02,998
Men's room is upstairs.

496
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:04,275
Great. I'm okay.

497
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,918
I like those shoes.

498
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,313
I can't stay down here, Alfred.

499
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:15,199
<i>Go upstairs and socialize.</i>

500
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,827
Some young lady from Metropolis
will make you honest.

501
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,554
In your dreams, Alfred.

502
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:23,719
<i>Books are knowledge,</i>

503
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,552
and knowledge is power,
and I am...

504
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,833
No. Uh, um...

505
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,719
No. What am I? I...
What was I saying? No.

506
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,432
The bittersweet pain among men

507
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,512
is having knowledge with
no power, because...

508
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,675
Because that is paradoxical!
And, um...

509
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,751
Thank you for coming.

510
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,547
<i>Please drink. Drink.</i>

511
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,838
Mr. Wayne? Mr. Wayne?
Clark Kent, Daily Planet.

512
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,956
My foundation has
already issued a statement

513
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,076
in support of books.

514
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:08,434
- Sir?
- Um...

515
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:12,068
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit.
Don't quote me. All right?

516
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:14,760
What's your position on
the Bat vigilante in Gotham?

517
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,512
<i>Daily Planet.</i> Do I own this one?
Or is that the other guy?

518
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:22,871
Civil liberties are being
trampled on in your city.

519
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:24,320
Good people are living in fear.

520
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,235
Don't believe everything you hear, son.

521
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,789
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.
He thinks he's above the law.

522
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,077
<i>The Daily Planet</i> criticizing
those who think they're above the law

523
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:42,277
is a little hypocritical,
wouldn't you say?

524
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,960
Considering every time
your hero saves a cat out of a tree,

525
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:48,269
you write a puff piece editorial

526
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,039
about an alien who, if he wanted to,

527
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:52,871
could burn the whole place down.

528
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,713
There wouldn't be a damn thing
we could do to stop him.

529
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,797
Most of the world doesn't
share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

530
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,519
Maybe it's the Gotham City in me.

531
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:08,275
We just have a bad history
with freaks dressed like clowns.

532
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,958
<i>Boys! Um!</i>

533
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:14,474
Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent. Ha!

534
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:16,471
I love it.
I love bringing people together.

535
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:17,639
How are we?

536
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,398
- Lex.
- Hello. Good.

537
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:21,755
Hi, hello, Lex, it is a pleasure.

538
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,989
Wow! That is a good grip!

539
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:26,231
You should not pick a fight
with this person.

540
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,815
So, after all these years,
we finally got you over to Metropolis.

541
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,400
Well, I thought I'd come drink you dry.

542
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:31,519
Well, you're welcome.

543
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:32,896
You should hop the harbor
more often, though.

544
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,079
I'd love to show you my labs.

545
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:36,195
Maybe we could partner on something.

546
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:38,829
My R and D is up to all sorts of no good.

547
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:44,748
That's seven minutes.

548
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,831
<i>Looks like the transfer's complete.</i>

549
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,509
- Mr. Luthor.
- Yes?

550
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:50,351
- The governor.
- Governor.

551
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:51,838
- Excuse me.
- Next time.

552
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:53,039
Governor! Hi!

553
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:55,077
Lex, it's good to see you.

554
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,480
Excuse me.

555
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:43,068
<i>We, as a population on this planet,</i>

556
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,559
<i>have been looking for a savior.</i>

557
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:46,949
<i>90% of people believe in a higher power,</i>

558
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:48,434
<i>and every religion believes</i>

559
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:50,476
<i>in some sort of messianic figure.</i>

560
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:53,632
<i>And when this savior character
actually comes to Earth,</i>

561
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,835
<i>we want to make him abide by our rules?</i>

562
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:57,996
<i>We have to understand that
this a paradigm shift.</i>

563
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:00,548
<i>We have to start thinking
beyond politics.</i>

564
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:03,280
<i>Are there any moral
constraints on this person?</i>

565
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,231
<i>We have international law.</i>

566
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,119
<i>On this Earth,
every act is a political act.</i>

567
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,197
<i>Is it really surprising</i>

568
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,590
<i>that the most powerful man in the world</i>

569
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,228
<i>should be a figure of controversy?</i>

570
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:18,507
<i>Uh, to have
an individual engaging</i>

571
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:20,715
<i>in these state-level interventions</i>

572
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,233
<i>should give us all pause.</i>

573
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,896
<i>Human beings
have a horrible track record</i>

574
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,434
<i>of following people with great power</i>

575
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,831
<i>down paths that led to
huge human atrocities.</i>

576
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,639
<i>We have always
created icons in our own image.</i>

577
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,110
<i>What we've done is
we project ourselves onto him.</i>

578
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,795
<i>The fact is, maybe he's not
some sort of devil or Jesus character.</i>

579
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,230
<i>Maybe he's just a guy
trying to do the right thing.</i>

580
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,358
<i>We're talking
about a being whose very existence</i>

581
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:50,353
<i>challenges our own
sense of priority in the universe.</i>

582
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:52,387
<i>And you go back to Copernicus,</i>

583
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:53,952
<i>where he restored the Sun</i>

584
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:55,559
<i>in the center of the known universe,</i>

585
00:54:55,639 --> 00:54:56,914
<i>displacing Earth.</i>

586
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:58,797
<i>And you get to Darwinian evolution,</i>

587
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,916
<i>and you find out we're not
special on this Earth,</i>

588
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:03,878
<i>we're just one among other lifeforms.</i>

589
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:05,518
<i>And now we learn that we're not even</i>

590
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:09,275
<i>special in the entire universe
because there is Superman.</i>

591
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:13,670
<i>There he is. An alien among us.</i>

592
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,954
<i>We're not alone.</i>

593
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,949
<i>Are you,
as a United States senator,</i>

594
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:22,398
<i>personally comfortable saying
to a grieving parent,</i>

595
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,074
<i>"Superman could have saved your child,</i>

596
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:30,199
<i>"but on principle,
we did not want him to act"?</i>

597
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,112
<i>I'm not saying he shouldn't act.</i>

598
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,077
<i>I'm saying he shouldn't act unilaterally.</i>

599
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:36,275
<i>What are we talking about here, then?</i>

600
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,907
<i>Must there be a Superman?</i>

601
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,514
<i>There is.</i>

602
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,280
<i>Hello?</i>

603
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,795
<i>Mom?</i>

604
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,193
Clark!

605
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,590
What is it? What's wrong?

606
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,751
<i>No. Nothing. I just...</i>

607
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,273
Hi.

608
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,480
Hi.

609
00:56:15,159 --> 00:56:16,797
How come Dad never left Kansas?

610
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,791
Well, he just...

611
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,793
You know how he was.

612
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,237
"What do I need to travel for?

613
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,112
"I'm already there."

614
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,878
Just wish it was more simple.

615
00:56:35,719 --> 00:56:37,072
My baby boy.

616
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,275
Nothing was ever simple.

617
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:50,157
An odd little duck.

618
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:53,599
<i>Hmm!</i>

619
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,199
I've never seen a metal like this.

620
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:00,152
Could be DARPA black box.

621
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,833
Who could find out?

622
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,717
Nobody who'd want to.

623
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,518
Maybe they gave them
out to the rebels to test in theater.

624
00:57:06,679 --> 00:57:08,829
Using live soldiers as guinea pigs?

625
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,070
This is what makes you
such a good reporter.

626
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:13,960
Stuff like this still shocks you.

627
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,387
It don't come off!
It don't come off!

628
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,353
Prisoner transfer!

629
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:44,634
You can't put me in general, man.
They gonna kill me.

630
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,936
Hey, you can't bring me to general.

631
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,695
You should be thanking
the tax payers of Metropolis

632
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:49,039
for taking in your branded ass.

633
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,416
- Sign here, please.
- I'm marked, man.

634
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,856
You know what they do
to people with this on them?

635
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,255
He's only a criminal.

636
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,079
- This way! Let's go!
- They're gonna kill me!

637
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,119
<i>- They're gonna kill me!</i>
- Let's go!

638
00:57:57,239 --> 00:57:59,594
Keefe. You made bail.

639
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,795
Open two.

640
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:07,668
Who paid?

641
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,239
Who the hell are you?

642
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,800
Just a man.

643
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,355
Yeah? Well, what the fuck do you want?

644
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,679
To help you stand for something.

645
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:43,552
Your three o'clock's here.

646
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:55,949
He made me half a man.

647
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,628
My wife walked out on me.

648
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:07,112
I can't even piss standing up.

649
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,793
<i>Let me face him.</i>

650
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,153
You'll take care of it?

651
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,108
Good.

652
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,914
What?

653
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,793
Wrong room, miss.

654
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:04,275
Secretary Swanwick,

655
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:06,159
you haven't been
returning my phone calls.

656
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,275
Miss Lane, if you'd like an interview,

657
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,829
Major Farris is just outside that door.

658
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:14,871
You're treating me like a stranger?

659
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:18,112
I'm treating you like a reporter.

660
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,153
All right. Is the US providing
experimental military arms

661
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,355
to rebels in Africa?

662
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:26,429
You know, with balls like yours,

663
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:28,358
you belong in here.

664
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:31,199
What's your source on this?
A tin foil hat?

665
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:33,710
No, not tin. But it's metal.

666
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,552
Fired in the Superman incident.

667
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:39,076
Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it.
We haven't been told the truth.

668
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,394
Here's the truth.

669
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,239
A reporter got greedy for a scoop
and went where she shouldn't have.

670
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,391
Superman acted like some rogue combatant

671
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,197
to rescue her, and people died.

672
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,918
Don't invent a conspiracy
theory to put back his halo.

673
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,389
Or yours.

674
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:55,918
- Major.
<i>- Sir.</i>

675
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,193
<i>So.</i>

676
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,237
I logged into your Dropbox to find copy.

677
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:02,358
There's copy all right.

678
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:06,398
But nothing about football.

679
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,755
Nothing about the friends
of the Metropolis Library,

680
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,478
just the goddamn Gotham Bat thing

681
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:15,152
I told you not to pursue.

682
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,760
If the police won't help,
the press has to do the right thing.

683
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,135
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.

684
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:21,753
When the Planet was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.

685
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,788
And so could you if it was 1938,
but it's not 1938.

686
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,996
WPA ain't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.

687
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:32,077
Not in here, not out there.
You drop this thing!

688
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:37,358
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.

689
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,351
<i>So apparently Superman</i>

690
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:43,559
<i>doesn't want us to think of him
as American anymore.</i>

691
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,954
<i>And really, why would we?</i>

692
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,951
<i>Aside from the red and blue costume.</i>

693
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:48,791
<i>And, I don't know, the fact that he has</i>

694
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,275
<i>one-third of the USA's
initials on his chest.</i>

695
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,016
<i>I assume the only reason he's not wearing</i>

696
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:55,235
<i>the Declaration of
Independence as a cape is...</i>

697
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,239
<i>He thinks it's too on-the-nose.</i>

698
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,199
<i>- What is going on back here?</i>
- No.

699
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,793
Guys, come on. Let's go.

700
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,255
<i>Get yourselves together and get out there.</i>

701
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,576
<i>Get those glasses on those trays.</i>

702
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:04,880
<i>We got thirsty people out there.</i>

703
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:15,393
I wonder, would you excuse us?

704
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:17,679
- There's something I'd like to show you.
- I'm sorry.

705
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:21,836
Now some scholars insist
that it never happened...

706
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,831
But I believe it's the action

707
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,992
perfectly in keeping with a king
who was also a psychopathic killer.

708
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,429
For me, it's the culmination
of 40 years curating.

709
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:35,637
And I can't believe it,
but I've finally got it here.

710
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,951
It's the Sword of Alexander.

711
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,273
It's the blade that cut the Gordian knot.

712
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:46,998
It's a triumph.

713
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:48,349
Yes.

714
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,197
<i>- Enjoy.
- Thank you.</i>

715
01:02:57,639 --> 01:02:59,197
It's a fake.

716
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,994
The real one was sold
in '98 on the black market.

717
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:03,275
And now it hangs...

718
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,317
Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.

719
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,278
Excuse me.

720
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:13,396
Excuse me, miss.

721
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:16,791
The other night you took something
that doesn't belong to you.

722
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,358
Stealing's not polite.

723
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:21,719
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?

724
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,038
Who are you?

725
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:27,713
Someone interested
in the same man you are.

726
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,233
Is that right?

727
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,675
I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph
that belongs to me.

728
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,159
Did you get it?

729
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,032
As it happens, no, I didn't.

730
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,717
The data you copied has
military-grade encryption.

731
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:44,434
You know, I bet with that dress,

732
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:47,239
9 out of 10 men will let you
get away with anything.

733
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,628
But you're the 10th?

734
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,398
I'm guessing I'm the first

735
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,237
to see through that
babe-in-the-woods act.

736
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:56,231
You don't know me,

737
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,992
but I've known a few women like you.

738
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,909
I don't think you've ever
known a woman like me.

739
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:08,594
You know, it's true what
they say about little boys.

740
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:11,958
Born with no natural
inclination to share.

741
01:04:13,159 --> 01:04:16,277
I didn't steal your drive. I borrowed it.

742
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,512
You'll find it in the glove
compartment of your car.

743
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,914
Mr. Wayne.

744
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:17,393
Did you get it?

745
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:18,559
The rock?

746
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:19,947
Yeah, we got it.

747
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,034
I'm sorry.

748
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:51,632
Get down! Get down now!

749
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,594
No!

750
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,193
She was my world.

751
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:07,871
And you took her from me.

752
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,271
<i>Bruce!</i>

753
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,318
Bruce! Listen to me now!

754
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,073
It's Lois!

755
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,234
It's Lois Lane!

756
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,787
<i>She's the key!</i>

757
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,279
Am I too soon?

758
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,273
I'm too soon!

759
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,511
<i>You're right about him!</i>

760
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,591
<i>You've always been right about him!</i>

761
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,114
Fear him! Fear him!

762
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,873
Find us, Bruce!

763
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,557
<i>You have to find us!</i>

764
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,676
<i>The</i> White Portuguese <i>is not a man.</i>

765
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:00,988
<i>It's a ship.</i>

766
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,832
Master Wayne, since the age of seven

767
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,877
you have been to the art of deception

768
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:11,507
as Mozart to the harpsichord.

769
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,716
But you've never been
too hot at lying to me.

770
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:20,351
The <i>White Portuguese</i> is not
carrying a dirty bomb.

771
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,918
<i>What is it carrying?</i>

772
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,474
It's a weapon.

773
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,872
It's a rock.

774
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:30,315
A mineral capable of weakening
Kryptonian cells.

775
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:32,239
<i>The first sample big enough
to mean something</i>

776
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:34,435
turned up in the Indian Ocean
three months ago.

777
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,231
It is now aboard the <i>White Portuguese</i>

778
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:38,715
being delivered to Lex Luthor.

779
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,472
Who I am going to steal it from.

780
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,516
To keep it out of Luthor's hands.

781
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,078
To destroy it.

782
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,708
No.

783
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:51,356
You're gonna go to war?

784
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:56,237
That son of a bitch brought
the war to us two years ago.

785
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,115
Jesus, Alfred. Count the dead.
Thousands of people.

786
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,239
What's next? Millions?

787
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:08,078
He has the power to wipe out
the entire human race,

788
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,800
and if we believe there's even
a 1 % chance that he is our enemy,

789
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,029
we have to take it
as an absolute certainty.

790
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,393
And we have to destroy him.

791
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,829
But he is not our enemy.

792
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,273
Not today.

793
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,716
20 years in Gotham, Alfred.

794
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:25,390
We've seen what promises are worth.

795
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,192
How many good guys are left.

796
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,278
How many stayed that way.

797
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:35,752
14 hours.

798
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:40,948
My name is Clark Kent.
I'm from the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

799
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,279
I'm trying to find out
what happened to an inmate,

800
01:12:47,479 --> 01:12:48,548
a Santos.

801
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,557
I can't give out that information.

802
01:13:08,199 --> 01:13:09,474
Mommy!

803
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:14,314
Mrs. Santos?

804
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,677
<i>May I ask you a few questions?</i>

805
01:13:18,199 --> 01:13:21,475
He wasn't my husband.
But I know what he did.

806
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,597
But he was a father. He was that, too.

807
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,436
They took him out of Gotham Central.

808
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,158
They moved him to Metropolis.

809
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,311
But inside they know.

810
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,875
They know the mark all over.
Guards don't care.

811
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:36,399
Bat's the judge.

812
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:39,190
One man decides who lives.

813
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:40,917
- How is that justice?
- Talk to me.

814
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,875
- Help me change it.
- With what? Your pen?

815
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,994
A man like that, words don't stop him.

816
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,432
You know stops him? A fist.

817
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:56,479
<i>Kent, I want
to talk to you.</i>

818
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,198
Kent!

819
01:14:00,359 --> 01:14:02,350
Where does he go?
Where does he go, Jenny?

820
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,038
I don't... I don't know.

821
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:07,431
Clicks his heels three times,
goes back to Kansas, I suppose.

822
01:14:09,239 --> 01:14:10,434
Son of a...

823
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,069
<i>Turn it! Turn it!</i>

824
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,158
Move out!

825
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:47,239
Go, go, go, go!

826
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:27,673
No!

827
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,828
Where is he?

828
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,274
Next time they shine
your light in the sky,

829
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,118
don't go to it.

830
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:20,635
The Bat is dead. Bury it.

831
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:23,554
Consider this mercy.

832
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,109
<i>Tell me.</i>

833
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,993
<i>Do you bleed?</i>

834
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,038
<i>You will.</i>

835
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:28,158
I don't have a halo over me,
Mr. Secretary.

836
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:29,997
I went into the desert, people died.

837
01:21:30,279 --> 01:21:31,952
It keeps me awake. It should.

838
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,640
If you think that Superman is a murderer,

839
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,319
then throw it away.

840
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,591
But I don't believe you think that.

841
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,476
<i>How do we determine
what's good?</i>

842
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,712
In a democracy, good is a conversation,

843
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,800
<i>not a unilateral decision.</i>

844
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:58,271
So I urge Superman to come

845
01:21:58,439 --> 01:21:59,997
<i>to this Hill of the People tomorrow</i>

846
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:01,797
<i>to see those who have suffered.</i>

847
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:05,313
<i>The world needs to know
what happened in that desert.</i>

848
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,512
<i>And to know what he stands for.</i>

849
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,670
<i>How far will he take his power?</i>

850
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:16,029
<i>Does he act by our will or by his own?</i>

851
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,752
<i>People hate
what they don't understand.</i>

852
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:32,029
But they see what you do,
and they know who you are.

853
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,671
You're not a killer, a threat.

854
01:22:38,359 --> 01:22:40,350
I never wanted this world to have you.

855
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,515
Be their hero, Clark. Be their monument.

856
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,309
Be their angel.
Be anything they need you to be.

857
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:53,872
Or be none of it.

858
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:57,595
You don't owe this world a thing.

859
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,557
You never did.

860
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:06,198
<i>This is DeNiros.
Transfer available to Kane Avenue.</i>

861
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:07,712
<i>Please, mind your step.</i>

862
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,829
<i>I have to speak to the senator today.</i>

863
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:41,496
<i>You cannot see the senator today.</i>

864
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,136
<i>I need to speak to her
before the hearing.</i>

865
01:23:43,159 --> 01:23:44,760
<i>Do you understand how important this is?</i>

866
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,496
<i>I cannot let you see the senator.</i>

867
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,112
<i>Please, I need to speak to her.</i>

868
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:51,118
<i>Please, madam. I beg of you!
Please don't do this!</i>

869
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:52,554
<i>This is so important!</i>

870
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,439
<i>- Come with me.
- Don't touch me!</i>

871
01:23:55,319 --> 01:23:57,197
- Please!
- I'm sorry. She wouldn't leave.

872
01:23:59,239 --> 01:24:00,752
I didn't tell you the truth.

873
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:04,070
C.I. thinks the desert was a setup.

874
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,676
Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty.

875
01:24:08,199 --> 01:24:10,190
The bullet?

876
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,876
The metal was developed
by a private company.

877
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:21,154
What company?

878
01:24:21,319 --> 01:24:22,435
LexCorp.

879
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:24,948
Lex Luthor?

880
01:24:25,159 --> 01:24:28,072
He also had private security contractors
at the desert compound.

881
01:24:32,399 --> 01:24:33,719
Go on record.

882
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:36,793
Not a chance. It's classified.

883
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:38,873
I happen to like my job.

884
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:40,109
It doesn't make sense.

885
01:24:40,279 --> 01:24:42,296
You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame Superman,

886
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:45,073
but how could they know
that he'd show up in the...

887
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,556
In the middle of the desert. Thank you.

888
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:00,555
The Senate hearing is expected
to get underway any minute now.

889
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,876
And of course the big
unknown in all of this is

890
01:25:03,079 --> 01:25:04,194
will Superman show up?

891
01:25:04,359 --> 01:25:05,496
That is what they're really
waiting to see.

892
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,635
Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe.

893
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,198
Soledad O'Brien, <i>In the Moment.</i>

894
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:09,469
Quick question for you.

895
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,296
You're heading in
to meet with the senators.

896
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:12,547
What will you tell them?

897
01:25:13,079 --> 01:25:16,037
<i>I've come here
to tell them to wake up.</i>

898
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:17,952
<i>This is flesh and blood.</i>

899
01:25:18,199 --> 01:25:19,632
<i>He has delivered a war here.</i>

900
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:20,840
<i>And this...</i>

901
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,514
<i>This is what war looks like.
I have nothing.</i>

902
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:27,479
<i>There are plenty of people,
sir, who would say he's their hero.</i>

903
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,398
<i>He is not a hero.</i>

904
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,194
Grace, can you get Greg up here, please?

905
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:33,628
Right now.

906
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,479
An anonymous source can verify everything

907
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,516
I told you about what
happened in Nairomi.

908
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:41,034
- An anonymous source?
- Run it.

909
01:25:41,239 --> 01:25:42,912
Luthor engineered the desert.

910
01:25:43,239 --> 01:25:45,390
It was an ambush for Superman.

911
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,895
Trust your reporter. Think Watergate.

912
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,557
<i>Yeah, and you need to think litigate.</i>

913
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,119
<i>If you're wrong, Luthor will
sue the paper out of existence.</i>

914
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:52,708
<i>You need proof.</i>

915
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:54,314
No. It needs to run now.

916
01:25:54,479 --> 01:25:55,479
<i>Before the hearing.</i>

917
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:57,496
<i>If Superman knows,
it might change what he says.</i>

918
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,555
I am not going to risk the paper

919
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,233
so that you can pass notes in class

920
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:02,634
to the man that rescued you.

921
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,194
<i>He paid her?</i>

922
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:07,078
Not only paid her.
He threatened her.

923
01:26:07,239 --> 01:26:08,592
Gave her a script to learn.

924
01:26:09,399 --> 01:26:11,277
Her parents are alive back home.

925
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:14,037
But the girl's got a conscience.

926
01:26:14,199 --> 01:26:16,055
He's been using the committee
as his puppet theater.

927
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:17,079
Senator!

928
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,953
Hi, you.

929
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:20,760
Don't go anywhere. I want to talk to you.

930
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:21,880
Uh, you know what?

931
01:26:22,039 --> 01:26:24,395
Mercy, you go in and make sure
no one takes my seat.

932
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,675
So what you been up to?

933
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,159
I'm just here to tell my story.

934
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:29,399
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,

935
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:31,119
but a certain junior senator from Kentucky

936
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:32,474
decided to block it.

937
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:36,917
Yes, the chair of the committee
on Superman is soft on security.

938
01:26:37,079 --> 01:26:38,576
Greg, why hasn't he been
getting our checks?

939
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,715
He is, Mr. Wayne.

940
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,880
He gets a check from
the Victims Fund every month.

941
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:43,194
He returns them.

942
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,231
<i>...who lost both his legs</i>

943
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:48,515
<i>in those horrific events in Metropolis</i>

944
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,948
<i>that happened two years ago.</i>

945
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:51,548
Jesus.

946
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,872
Why haven't I seen this?

947
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:56,840
<i>I'm sorry.
I'll get to the bottom of it.</i>

948
01:26:57,479 --> 01:26:59,788
<i>And there he is. Superman is here.</i>

949
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:02,036
<i>He is actually
at the United States Capitol.</i>

950
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:04,470
<i>This is really a historic moment.</i>

951
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,551
<i>Now we expect that Superman will give</i>

952
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,631
<i>some kind of a statement to the Senate,</i>

953
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,519
<i>to the American people,
and, of course, to the world.</i>

954
01:27:12,319 --> 01:27:13,469
He's here. He came.

955
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,358
- He's above the Capitol.
- Ah.

956
01:27:16,359 --> 01:27:18,920
You are gonna be on the
hot seat in there, Junebug.

957
01:27:19,159 --> 01:27:22,390
I grew up on a farm.
I know how to wrestle a pig.

958
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,399
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

959
01:27:26,439 --> 01:27:28,192
It's that power can be innocent.

960
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:31,515
Good luck.

961
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,396
Oh, miss...

962
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,152
Rudy, she's good to go.

963
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:20,954
Get out!

964
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,033
- Get out! Get out!
- Superman! Superman!

965
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:36,079
Another one came
this morning, Mr. Wayne.

966
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:17,877
Let me say at the outset
that I'm grateful to our witness

967
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:19,439
for coming before us today.

968
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:23,270
This is how a democracy works.

969
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,359
We talk to each other.

970
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:30,429
We act by the consent
of the governed, sir.

971
01:29:32,279 --> 01:29:35,636
<i>I have sat here before
to say that shadow interventions</i>

972
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,399
<i>will not be tolerated by this committee.</i>

973
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,595
<i>Neither will lies.</i>

974
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:45,109
Because today is a day for truth.

975
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,637
Because only by speaking...

976
01:29:59,239 --> 01:30:03,313
Only by working together can we...

977
01:30:09,479 --> 01:30:10,628
Can we...

978
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,989
Can we create a free, and a...

979
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:54,199
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

980
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,956
<i>We're back
at the nation's Capitol,</i>

981
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:22,599
<i>where something is happening.</i>

982
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:41,920
<i>Excuse me.</i>

983
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,113
Excuse me, officer.

984
01:31:45,159 --> 01:31:47,594
Member of the press.
Can you let me in, please?

985
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,079
Breathe slowly and deeply.

986
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:58,795
You're gonna be fine.

987
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:09,916
Thank you.
I'm gonna need a little room to work.

988
01:32:11,319 --> 01:32:14,038
<i>Ma'am, it appears you've
suffered a head injury.</i>

989
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,039
I'm gonna need you
to follow my light with your eyes.

990
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,153
<i>Master Wayne.</i>

991
01:33:12,319 --> 01:33:14,072
Mr. Wayne!

992
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:19,318
<i>...in the Senate hearing room
where Superman was testifying.</i>

993
01:33:19,479 --> 01:33:22,198
<i>This is a catastrophic
situation at our nation's Capitol.</i>

994
01:33:22,359 --> 01:33:23,680
<i>We don't have exact numbers yet,</i>

995
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,916
<i>but I can tell you that
more than a dozen people</i>

996
01:33:26,119 --> 01:33:27,552
<i>have died in this explosion.</i>

997
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:28,935
<i>First responders are at the scene.</i>

998
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,756
<i>They are still bringing victims out.</i>

999
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,278
<i>Now initially, Superman was helping
bring victims out after the blast,</i>

1000
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:37,748
<i>but he seems to have disappeared...</i>

1001
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,216
<i>...raising questions.</i>

1002
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:42,037
<i>Carrie Birmingham,
reporting live from the nation's capital.</i>

1003
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:45,000
<i>Capitol police are now
confirming that the blast was caused</i>

1004
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:47,712
<i>by an explosive device
inside the hearing room.</i>

1005

<i>Run that one more time for me.</i>

1006
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:18,078
- Can you enhance that?
- There you go, sir.

1007
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:59,194
<i>Capitol police are confirming to CNN</i>

1008
01:34:59,399 --> 01:35:00,752

1009

<i>Wallace Vernon Keefe. Now these sources...</i>

1010
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:04,792
Clark, it's me again. Can you...

1011
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,279
<i>...could have gotten
the explosive device into the hearing</i>

1012
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:09,555
<i>by concealing them inside his wheelchair.</i>

1013
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,957
<i>As for Superman, he was in the room,
but obviously failed to stop him.</i>

1014
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:14,394
I didn't see it, Lo.

1015
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,551
I was standing right there
and I didn't see it.

1016
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,159
Clark, there are people behind this.

1017
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:22,192
I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.

1018
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,274
All this time,

1019
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:29,634
I've been living my life
the way my father saw it.

1020
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:32,956
Righting wrongs for a ghost.

1021
01:35:35,319 --> 01:35:37,515
Thinking I'm here to do good.

1022
01:35:41,399 --> 01:35:43,310
Superman was never real.

1023
01:35:44,279 --> 01:35:46,635
Just the dream of a farmer from Kansas.

1024
01:35:48,199 --> 01:35:51,112
That farmer's dream
is all some people have.

1025
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:53,994
It's all that gives them hope.

1026
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:06,671
This means something.

1027
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,671
It did on my world.

1028
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,309
My world doesn't exist anymore.

1029

Yes, I would.

01:37:44,199 --> 01:37:46,110
Yes, I would.

Good. Teach me.

<i>Analyzing.</i>

01:41:10,279 --> 01:41:12,555
You flew too close to the sun.

1045
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:16,671
Now look at you.

1046

<i>Advising. Action forbidden.</i>

<i>The desecration without name.</i>

And where is the Council of Krypton?

1052
01:41:35,239 --> 01:41:36,354
<i>Destroyed, sir.</i>

1053
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:38,993
Then proceed.

1054
01:41:39,479 --> 01:41:40,798
<i>Very well.</i>

"was he then complicit
in the Capitol tragedy?"

1059

Still no Kent?

1060
01:41:56,199 --> 01:41:57,920
<i>"His disappearance

1061
01:41:58,159 --> 01:41:59,194
No.

1062
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:01,536
<i>There are still so many
unanswered questions.</i>

1063
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:02,628
<i>Chief among them,</i>

1064
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:05,512
<i>whether Superman was involved

<i>I mean, here's an individual

For 20 American, he didn't see you.

1071
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,868
Same for me.

1072
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,796
<i>Now one FBI official
familiar with this case</i>

1073
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:01,551

<i>"A jackpot of bomb-making materials
inside Keefe's apartment. "</i>

1075
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,078
<i>What they need to determine now is</i>

1076
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:10,476
<i>whether he had any help in the planning
and execution of the bombing.</i>

1077
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:15,030
<i>And they haven 't ruled out the idea
that Superman was a co-conspirator.</i>

1078
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,188
<i>Now, my sources are telling me</i>

1079
01:43:17,359 --> 01:43:20,396
<i>they are getting a barrage of anonymous

<i>with all roads in this investigation

1081
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,829
All right, Lois. You gotta go.

1082
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:23,756
He didn't know he was gonna die.

1083
01:44:25,039 --> 01:44:26,677
He just bought groceries.

1084
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,636
The wheelchair and
the bullet from the desert

1085
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,676
were made from the same metal.

1086
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,119
I know. The desert. The hearing.

1087
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:34,832
Everywhere Superman goes,
Luthor wants death.

1088
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,467
<i>But, Luthor goes
through all of that trouble...</i>

1089
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:40,837
Creates a bomb out of a wheelchair,
and then alters it to reduce the blast?

1090
01:44:41,039 --> 01:44:42,631
What do you mean?

1091
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,359
The inside of the chair
was lined with lead.

1092
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:49,038
You couldn't stop it.

1093
01:44:49,479 --> 01:44:51,675
You couldn't see it.

1094
01:45:34,039 --> 01:45:35,359
Something, isn't it?

1095
01:45:37,239 --> 01:45:41,233
We men of Kansas live on a pancake,
so we come to the mountains.

1096
01:45:42,359 --> 01:45:45,988
All downhill from here,
down to the floodplain.

1097
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:48,195
Farm at the bottom of the world.

1098
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,877
I remember one season the water came bad.

1099
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:55,076
I couldn't have been 12.

1100
01:45:55,279 --> 01:45:58,158
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.

1101
01:45:58,319 --> 01:46:00,095
We worked till, I think, I fainted.

1102
01:46:00,119 --> 01:46:01,872
But we managed to stop the water.

1103
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:04,837
We saved the farm.

1104
01:46:06,239 --> 01:46:09,311
Your grandma baked me a cake.
Said I was a hero.

1105
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,798
Later that day we found out
we blocked the water all right.

1106
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,319
We sent it upstream.

1107
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,715
The whole Lang farm washed away.

1108
01:46:22,079 --> 01:46:24,957
<i>While I ate my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.</i>

1109
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:30,639
I used to hear them wailing in my sleep.

1110
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:36,195
Did the nightmares ever stop?

1111
01:46:38,319 --> 01:46:39,639
Yeah.

1112
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:42,591
When I met your mother.

1113
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:47,438
She gave me faith that
there's good in this world.

1114
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,194
<i>She was my world.</i>

1115
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:56,471
I miss you, son.

1116
01:47:01,399 --> 01:47:03,390
I miss you too, Dad.

1117
01:47:23,239 --> 01:47:24,832
You know you can't win this.

1118
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:28,152
It's suicide.

1119
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:34,315
I'm older now than my father ever was.

1120
01:47:36,319 --> 01:47:39,231
This may be the only thing
I do that matters.

1121
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,878
20 years of fighting criminals
amounts to nothing?

1122
01:47:44,039 --> 01:47:46,600
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.

1123
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:49,512
Pull one up, another grows in its place.

1124
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:53,872
This is about the future of the world.

1125
01:47:55,079 --> 01:47:56,671
This is my legacy.

1126
01:47:58,279 --> 01:48:00,270
My father sat me down right here.

1127
01:48:00,439 --> 01:48:02,192
Told me what Wayne Manor was built on.

1128
01:48:02,359 --> 01:48:05,988
Railroads, real estates, and oil.

1129
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:09,630
The first generation made their fortune
trading with the French.

1130
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:11,391
Pelts and skins.

1131
01:48:15,319 --> 01:48:16,992
They were hunters.

1132
01:48:33,439 --> 01:48:36,158
So falls the house of Wayne.

1133
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:40,748
<i>We gotta wait for more
evidence, but the question still remains,</i>

1134
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:42,034
<i>where is he?</i>

1135
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,989
<i>If Superman was not involved,</i>

1136
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:46,474
<i>if he's got nothing to hide,</i>

1137
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:50,274
<i>then why hasn 't he been seen
since the day of this tragedy?</i>

1138
01:48:50,439 --> 01:48:52,095
<i>You can't point a finger and...</i>

1139
01:48:52,119 --> 01:48:54,400
<i>I'm not pointing anything, Warren.
Look. Ten fingers, see?</i>

1140
01:48:54,439 --> 01:48:56,270
<i>If there is going to be a criminal...</i>

1141
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,551
The night is here.

1142
01:50:57,319 --> 01:50:58,514
Excuse me.

1143
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:01,708
Don't I know...

1144
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:08,673
Plain Lo in the morning. Lola in slacks.

1145
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,194
Lois Lane.

1146
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:15,153
Mmm. Come see the view.

1147
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:17,396
Um... Mmm-mmm.

1148
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:22,037
Now the secret to the height
is the building material.

1149
01:52:22,199 --> 01:52:25,988
It's light metals
which sway a bit in the wind.

1150
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Hmm.

1151
01:52:30,359 --> 01:52:32,015
And you know something
about LexCorp metals,

1152
01:52:32,039 --> 01:52:33,439
don't you, Miss Lane?

1153
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:35,835
I've proven what you've done.

1154
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,512
Wow, you're feisty.

1155
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:39,988
Unfortunately, that will blow away.

1156
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:41,672
Like sand in the desert.

1157
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,511
You're psychotic.

1158
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:47,149
That is a three-syllable word
for any thought too big for little minds.

1159
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:49,671
Hmm. Next category: circles.

1160
01:52:50,199 --> 01:52:55,149
Round and round
and round they go to find Superman.

1161
01:52:55,319 --> 01:52:57,095
Wrong category, boy.
No, no, triangles.

1162
01:52:57,119 --> 01:52:58,519
Yes, Euclid's triangle inequality.

1163
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,671
The shortest distance
between any two points

1164
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:02,511
is a straight path.

1165
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:05,478
And I believe
the straightest path to Superman

1166
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:07,311
is a pretty little road...

1167
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:09,475
Mmm. Called Lois Lane.

1168
01:53:32,039 --> 01:53:33,552
You came back.

1169
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:35,878
You came back.

1170
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,229
Boy, do we have problems up here!

1171
01:54:01,399 --> 01:54:03,993
The problem of... Of evil in the world.

1172
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:05,990
Uh, the problem of absolute virtue.

1173
01:54:06,159 --> 01:54:08,354
I'll take you in without breaking you.

1174
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,470
Which is more than you deserve.

1175
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:12,595
The problem of you
on top of everything else.

1176
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:13,908
You above all.

1177
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:16,391
Ah, because that's what God is.

1178
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:21,118
Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El.

1179
01:54:22,319 --> 01:54:25,436
Clark Joseph Kent.

1180
01:54:27,119 --> 01:54:30,555
See, what we call God
depends upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.

1181
01:54:31,319 --> 01:54:34,278
Because God is tribal. God takes sides.

1182
01:54:34,439 --> 01:54:36,270
No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boy

1183
01:54:36,439 --> 01:54:39,158
to deliver me from
Daddy's fist and abominations. Mmm.

1184
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:41,356
I figured out way back,

1185
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:44,837
if God is all-powerful,
he cannot be all-good.

1186
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:49,596
And if he is all-good,
then he cannot be all-powerful.

1187
01:54:50,359 --> 01:54:52,270
And neither can you be.

1188
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:55,108
They need to see the fraud you are.

1189
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:57,391
With their eyes.

1190
01:54:58,359 --> 01:55:00,715
The blood on your hands.

1191
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,551
What have you done?

1192
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:04,471
Hmm. And tonight, they will.

1193
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:08,269
Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date. Hmm.

1194
01:55:08,479 --> 01:55:10,152
Across the bay.

1195
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:12,515
Ripe fruit, his hate. Two years growing.

1196
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:14,576
But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.

1197
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,318
Little red notes, big bang.

1198
01:55:16,479 --> 01:55:17,832
You let your family die!

1199
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:24,796
<i>And now you will fly to him.
And you will battle him.</i>

1200
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,109
To the death.

1201
01:55:27,359 --> 01:55:30,271
Black and blue. Fight Night!

1202
01:55:31,239 --> 01:55:34,118
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.

1203
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:36,595
God versus man.

1204
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,711
Day versus night.

1205
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:42,876
Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham.

1206
01:55:43,079 --> 01:55:45,149
You think I'll fight him for you?

1207
01:55:45,359 --> 01:55:46,395
Hmm, yes, I do.

1208
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:49,320
I think you will fight-fight-fight
for that special lady in your life.

1209
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:52,194
She's safe on the ground. How about you?

1210
01:55:52,359 --> 01:55:55,113
Close, but I am not talking about Lois.

1211
01:55:55,279 --> 01:55:56,314
No.

1212
01:55:56,479 --> 01:55:59,789
Every boy's special lady is his mother.

1213
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,479
Martha, Martha, Martha.

1214
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:09,880
Hmm.

1215
01:56:10,079 --> 01:56:13,435
Why, the mother of a flying demon
must be a witch.

1216
01:56:14,199 --> 01:56:16,713
The punishment for witches, what is that?

1217
01:56:17,039 --> 01:56:19,234
That's right. Death by fire.

1218
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:22,838
Mmm.

1219
01:56:29,119 --> 01:56:31,030
Where is she?

1220
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:32,880
I don't know!
I would not let them tell me!

1221
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:35,269
Uh-uh-uh! If you kill me, Martha dies.

1222
01:56:35,439 --> 01:56:37,119
And if you fly away, mmm,
Martha also dies.

1223
01:56:37,279 --> 01:56:39,998
But if you kill the Bat...

1224
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:41,797
Martha lives.

1225
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:50,029
There we go. There we go. Hmm.

1226
01:56:52,479 --> 01:56:55,916
And now God bends to my will.

1227
01:57:02,359 --> 01:57:04,748
Ooh, now the cameras
are waiting at your ship.

1228
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:07,109
For the world to see
the holes in the holy.

1229
01:57:07,279 --> 01:57:09,953
Yes, the Almighty comes clean
about how dirty he is when it counts.

1230
01:57:10,119 --> 01:57:11,314
To save Martha,

1231
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:13,711
bring me the head of the Bat.

1232
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:17,960
Ah.

1233
01:57:18,199 --> 01:57:20,997
Mother of God, would you look at the time?

1234
01:57:21,159 --> 01:57:23,435
When you came here, you had an hour.

1235
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,631
Now it's less.

1236
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,176
<i>Brooke Baldwin is on the scene.</i>

1237
01:58:30,199 --> 01:58:32,239
<i>Brooke, you're live on the air.
What are you seeing?</i>

1238
01:58:32,319 --> 01:58:33,920
There's something happening at the ship.

1239
01:58:35,279 --> 01:58:37,668
It's sending massive power surges.

1240
01:58:38,359 --> 01:58:40,095
<i>Police helicopters surrounding the area.</i>

1241
01:58:40,119 --> 01:58:42,475
<i>They've created a barricade
around this containment center.</i>

1242
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:44,176
<i>And we're trying to get
a little bit closer here</i>

1243
01:58:44,199 --> 01:58:45,474
<i>to find out what's going on.</i>

1244
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:46,873
<i>It is absolute chaos.</i>

1245
01:58:47,039 --> 01:58:49,679
<i>You can see that lightning,
those surges of electricity.</i>

1246
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:52,559
<i>They seem to be getting
stronger by the minute.</i>

1247
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:53,993
<i>Daily Planet.</i>

1248
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:56,828
Lois.

1249
01:58:58,079 --> 01:59:00,039
I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.

1250
01:59:00,199 --> 01:59:01,199
Who?

1251
01:59:03,399 --> 01:59:05,595
Or he has to die.

1252
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:06,760
Clark.

1253
01:59:10,079 --> 01:59:12,389
No one stays good in this world.

1254
01:59:21,199 --> 01:59:25,033
<i>But as of right now, much of
the city remains in the dark tonight.</i>

1255
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:26,199
<i>Much chaos.</i>

1256
01:59:26,439 --> 01:59:29,351
<i>Much confusing happening
on the streets of Metropolis tonight.</i>

1257
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:31,336
<i>Those helicopters are still
surrounding the area.</i>

1258
01:59:31,359 --> 01:59:34,158
<i>I don't know if you can
still see those bolts of lightning...</i>

1259
02:01:36,039 --> 02:01:41,238
<i>2400 hours and 2 minutes.
Subject declining rapidly.</i>

1260
02:01:41,399 --> 02:01:43,310
<i>All procedural interventions have failed.</i>

1261
02:01:48,239 --> 02:01:50,439
<i>Outcome will be death.</i>

1262
02:01:58,199 --> 02:02:01,112
<i>Dr. Silas Stone
suspending all clinical protocol.</i>

1263
02:02:01,279 --> 02:02:07,719
<i>US Gov, object 6-19-82
is successfully activated.</i>

1264
02:02:29,159 --> 02:02:30,752
<i>I need a chopper to Gotham.</i>

1265
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:31,920
Call the heliport.

1266
02:02:32,079 --> 02:02:33,877
Chopper? We can barely afford a bicycle.

1267
02:02:34,039 --> 02:02:35,917
You wanna chase a story? Go to the ship.

1268
02:02:36,079 --> 02:02:37,439
Superman's probably there already.

1269
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:40,557
Perry, it's not for a story.

1270
02:02:45,279 --> 02:02:46,759
Jenny, get her a chopper to Gotham.

1271
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:49,632
And forget the heliport.
Put it on the goddamn roof.

1272
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,113
On the roof, Lois!

1273
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:55,153
Where are we headed?

1274
02:02:55,319 --> 02:02:56,435
There!

1275
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:15,478
<i>Well, here I am.</i>

1276
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:18,432
Bruce. Please.

1277
02:03:20,079 --> 02:03:23,072
I was wrong. You have to listen to me.

1278
02:03:23,239 --> 02:03:24,514
Lex wants us to...

1279
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:42,079
You don't understand.

1280
02:03:42,239 --> 02:03:43,752
There's no time!

1281
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:46,153
<i>I understand.</i>

1282
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,278
Stay down!

1283
02:05:04,439 --> 02:05:06,748
If I wanted it, you'd be dead already.

1284
02:05:44,279 --> 02:05:46,077
<i>Breathe it in.</i>

1285
02:05:49,039 --> 02:05:50,951
<i>That's fear.</i>

1286
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:55,077
<i>You're not brave.</i>

1287
02:05:59,279 --> 02:06:00,917
<i>Men are brave.</i>

1288
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:54,354
<i>I bet your parents taught you
that you mean something.</i>

1289
02:09:55,199 --> 02:09:57,030
<i>That you're here for a reason.</i>

1290
02:09:58,359 --> 02:10:01,396
<i>My parents taught me a different lesson,</i>

1291
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:03,918
<i>dying in the gutter</i>

1292
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:06,710
<i>for no reason at all.</i>

1293
02:10:23,279 --> 02:10:25,747
<i>They taught me the world only makes sense</i>

1294
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:27,951
<i>if you force it to.</i>

1295
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:07,636
<i>You were never a God.</i>

1296
02:11:11,359 --> 02:11:13,315
<i>You were never even a man.</i>

1297
02:11:20,119 --> 02:11:23,635
You're letting him kill Martha.

1298
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:30,916
<i>What does that mean?</i>

1299
02:11:32,119 --> 02:11:33,837
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1300
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:37,474
Find him.

1301
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:40,153
Save

1302
02:11:40,479 --> 02:11:42,152
<i>Martha.</i>

1303
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:46,471
<i>Martha.</i>

1304
02:12:17,359 --> 02:12:19,350
Martha.

1305
02:12:23,479 --> 02:12:24,753
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1306
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:28,192
<i>Martha! Why did you say that name?</i>

1307
02:12:28,359 --> 02:12:29,838
Clark! Stop!

1308
02:12:30,039 --> 02:12:31,189
Please! Stop!

1309
02:12:31,359 --> 02:12:32,872
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1310
02:12:33,039 --> 02:12:34,597
It's his mother's name!

1311
02:12:35,199 --> 02:12:37,350
It's his mother's name.

1312
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:10,159
<i>We're not getting any answers.</i>

1313
02:13:10,199 --> 02:13:12,095
We're still right outside
the containment center.

1314
02:13:12,119 --> 02:13:13,189
A dangerous situation.

1315
02:13:13,359 --> 02:13:16,591
Military and police personnel
surrounding the area.

1316
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:33,233
<i>Luthor.</i>

1317
02:13:33,439 --> 02:13:35,555
He wanted your life for hers.

1318
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:38,078
She's losing time.

1319
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:41,068
The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.

1320
02:13:41,279 --> 02:13:42,917
It's got to be Lex.

1321
02:13:43,079 --> 02:13:45,912
<i>They need you at that ship.
I'll find her.</i>

1322
02:13:46,119 --> 02:13:48,429
- My mother needs me.
- Wait.

1323
02:13:49,079 --> 02:13:51,274
<i>I'll make you a promise.</i>

1324
02:13:51,439 --> 02:13:53,635
<i>Martha won't die tonight.</i>

1325
02:14:20,479 --> 02:14:21,628
<i>Master Wayne.</i>

1326
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:23,198
<i>Alfred.</i>

1327
02:14:23,359 --> 02:14:26,193
Uh, I'm sorry for listening in,
but I've tracked the Russian's phone

1328
02:14:26,359 --> 02:14:27,838
to a warehouse near the port.

1329
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,432
<i>You're locked onto it.</i>

1330
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:31,318
<i>I don't deserve you, Alfred.</i>

1331
02:14:31,479 --> 02:14:33,948
No, sir. You don't.

1332
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:56,034
I'm afraid this is goodbye.

1333
02:14:58,159 --> 02:15:02,631
And every time we say goodbye,
you die a little.

1334
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:17,398
- Take it down.
- Go! Go!

1335
02:15:41,039 --> 02:15:42,189
<i>You have to take it, Alfred.</i>

1336
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,233
Ah, right.

1337
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:46,756
Commencing drone mode.

1338
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:54,238
Thermal imaging is showing me
two dozen hostiles on the third floor.

1339
02:15:54,399 --> 02:15:56,595
Why don't I drop you off on the second?

1340
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:03,918
Drop it.

1341
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:06,790
I said drop it!

1342
02:19:07,879 --> 02:19:09,279
I'll kill her.

1343
02:19:11,079 --> 02:19:13,434
Believe me, I'll do it.

1344
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:17,429
<i>I believe you.</i>

1345
02:19:29,959 --> 02:19:32,190
<i>It's okay. I'm a friend of your son's.</i>

1346
02:19:32,639 --> 02:19:34,231
I figured.

1347
02:19:34,399 --> 02:19:35,799
The cape.

1348
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:05,317
"Late, late," says the White Rabbit.

1349
02:20:05,479 --> 02:20:06,976
<i>Forty seconds to animation.</i>

1350
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,478
Right, wabbit?

1351
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:12,468
Hmm. Out of tricks, out of time.

1352
02:20:13,479 --> 02:20:16,119
And one Bat head short.

1353
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:18,510
<i>Thirty seconds to animation.</i>

1354
02:20:18,719 --> 02:20:20,799
Ah. That'll be the cook. Excuse me.

1355
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:23,069
Uh, Gotham Roast. Well done.

1356
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:25,671
Hello. Break the bad news.

1357
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:28,638
<i>I'd rather do
the breaking in person.</i>

1358
02:20:28,799 --> 02:20:30,495
<i>Twenty seconds to animation.</i>

1359
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:32,191
You've lost.

1360
02:20:32,399 --> 02:20:33,913
I don't know how to lose.

1361
02:20:34,079 --> 02:20:35,513
You'll learn.

1362
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:36,795
I'll learn.

1363
02:20:36,959 --> 02:20:38,551
I don't hate the sinner.

1364
02:20:39,079 --> 02:20:40,990
- I hate the sin.
<i>- 10 seconds to animation.</i>

1365
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:43,793
And yours, my friend, is existing.

1366
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:46,032
I cannot let you win.

1367
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:48,816
I gave the Bat a fighting chance to do it,
but he was not strong enough.

1368
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:50,751
So, if man won't kill God...

1369
02:20:50,959 --> 02:20:52,677
<i>...two, one.</i>

1370
02:20:54,479 --> 02:20:55,674
...the devil will do it!

1371
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:13,075
Perry!

1372
02:21:13,399 --> 02:21:15,072
All right. Stay calm, everybody!

1373
02:21:15,959 --> 02:21:17,799
<i>We're getting reports
there are total blackouts</i>

1374
02:21:17,879 --> 02:21:20,757
<i>in the north and to
the northwest of the city.</i>

1375
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:22,056
<i>Federal authorities
are trying to determine</i>

1376
02:21:22,079 --> 02:21:24,388
<i>if this is part of
a larger terrorist attack.</i>

1377
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:31,558
Ancient Kryptonian deformity.

1378
02:21:32,079 --> 02:21:35,355
Hmm. Blood of my blood.

1379
02:21:42,319 --> 02:21:44,275
Born to destroy you.

1380
02:21:47,239 --> 02:21:48,388
Your Doomsday.

1381
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:17,477
Now God is good as dead.

1382
02:22:20,399 --> 02:22:21,593
Oh!

1383
02:23:40,520 --> 02:23:41,793
POTUS joining.

1384
02:23:41,959 --> 02:23:42,959
Mr. President.

1385
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:44,335
<i>What the hell is it, Calvin?</i>

1386
02:23:44,360 --> 02:23:46,040
<i>These are live images from the top</i>

1387
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:49,236
<i>of the LexCorp tower
in downtown Metropolis.</i>

1388
02:23:49,399 --> 02:23:50,833
<i>Military aircraft are on the scene.</i>

1389
02:24:02,639 --> 02:24:04,391
- Are you hurt, ma'am?
- I'm okay.

1390
02:24:04,559 --> 02:24:06,231
Good. You're gonna be all right, okay?

1391
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:19,396
<i>This thing emerged
from the Kryptonian crash site</i>

1392
02:24:19,559 --> 02:24:20,594
<i>just moments ago.</i>

1393
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:23,797
<i>Thankfully though, the work day is over
in the downtown core.</i>

1394
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,068
<i>It's nearly empty.</i>

1395
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:28,877
<i>Now military aircraft.
Those are Apache helicopters.</i>

1396
02:24:29,079 --> 02:24:31,513
<i>They have now just arrived.
The images that...</i>

1397
02:25:07,799 --> 02:25:10,836
<i>We've, uh... We just lost
connection with Metropolis 8 News.</i>

1398
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,433
<i>Now, it's not clear what just happened.</i>

1399
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:18,677
<i>What's happening there, Alfred?</i>

1400
02:25:20,360 --> 02:25:22,476
How best to describe it?

1401
02:25:22,639 --> 02:25:24,015
<i>Metropolis airspace
has been closed briefly.</i>

1402
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:25,159
Excuse me?

1403
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:26,456
<i>We kindly ask that you stay in your seats.</i>

1404
02:25:26,479 --> 02:25:27,674
Excuse me?

1405
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:29,238
Miss Prince?

1406
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:45,870
Sir. Look, they've cleared the city.

1407
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:47,296
Looks like he's taking it into space.

1408
02:25:47,319 --> 02:25:49,015
We can go
straight to Key Red, Mr. President.

1409
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:50,995
Not yet. Are you crazy?

1410
02:25:51,159 --> 02:25:53,456
They're high enough that we can nuke 'em
with no casualties, sir.

1411
02:25:53,479 --> 02:25:56,870
One casualty, Mr. President. Superman.

1412
02:25:58,760 --> 02:26:00,512
<i>God have mercy on us all.</i>

1413
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:08,838
- Key is hot.
- Key is hot.

1414
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,399
Red birds are armed to deploy, sir.

1415
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:13,189
<i>Fire at will.</i>

1416
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:15,510
Three, two, one...

1417
02:27:04,399 --> 02:27:05,913
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1418
02:27:27,639 --> 02:27:29,436
Projectile 1. Impact.

1419
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:31,511
Stryker's Island, east of Metropolis.

1420
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:32,828
That's uninhabited.

1421
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,352
Projectile 2...

1422
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,318
No apparent reentry.

1423
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:43,916
<i>Projectile 2?</i>

1424
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:49,513
Superman, Mr. President.
Projectile 2 was Superman.

1425
02:27:50,120 --> 02:27:51,791
Sir.

1426
02:27:51,959 --> 02:27:53,109
It's moving.

1427
02:28:34,399 --> 02:28:36,230
<i>The shockwaves are getting stronger.</i>

1428
02:28:36,399 --> 02:28:39,471
Every time we hit it,
we make it more powerful.

1429
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:40,795
We can't attack.

1430
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:43,989
<i>What are you saying, Calvin?</i>

1431
02:28:44,159 --> 02:28:46,389
I'm saying it's unkillable.

1432
02:29:14,399 --> 02:29:16,515
Master Wayne, are you receiving me?

1433
02:29:16,680 --> 02:29:17,680
<i>Alfred.</i>

1434
02:29:17,879 --> 02:29:19,518
<i>It's Kryptonian.</i>

1435
02:29:19,719 --> 02:29:21,835
<i>Only Kryptonite weapons can kill it.</i>

1436
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:25,389
They might. If you had any left.

1437
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:27,556
<i>I got one round left.</i>

1438
02:29:28,799 --> 02:29:32,951
<i>The spear. Alfred, the spear.
It's pure Kryptonite.</i>

1439
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:34,394
<i>It's back in Gotham.</i>

1440
02:29:34,559 --> 02:29:37,393
<i>If I can penetrate the skin,
the spear will kill it.</i>

1441
02:29:37,559 --> 02:29:38,559
It would in theory.

1442
02:29:38,719 --> 02:29:41,870
<i>I've gotta get it to chase me
back to the city.</i>

1443
02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:43,760
<i>Back to the Kryptonite.</i>

1444
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:45,917
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1445
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:37,076
Why did you bring him back to the city?

1446
02:31:37,239 --> 02:31:38,753
<i>The port is abandoned.</i>

1447
02:31:38,920 --> 02:31:40,717
<i>There's a weapon here that can kill it.</i>

1448
02:31:53,440 --> 02:31:54,634
Did you find the spear?

1449
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:57,316
<i>I've been a little busy.</i>

1450
02:31:57,479 --> 02:32:00,676
This thing, this creature,
seems to feed on energy.

1451
02:32:02,440 --> 02:32:05,716
This thing is from another world.

1452
02:32:06,479 --> 02:32:07,479
My world.

1453
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:10,831
I've killed things
from other worlds before.

1454
02:32:11,959 --> 02:32:13,109
Is she with you?

1455
02:32:13,959 --> 02:32:16,554
<i>I thought she was with you.</i>

1456
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:55,509
Clark!

1457
02:35:56,200 --> 02:35:57,519
Clark!

1458
02:36:04,840 --> 02:36:06,192
Clark!

1459
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:17,509
Clark!

1460
02:36:18,399 --> 02:36:20,390
Clark! Are you all right?

1461
02:36:57,639 --> 02:36:59,755
I love you.

1462
02:37:03,079 --> 02:37:06,674
No. No, Clark, you can't.

1463
02:37:08,239 --> 02:37:09,912
This is my world.

1464
02:37:10,079 --> 02:37:11,513
No, Clark, don't.

1465
02:37:15,360 --> 02:37:17,430
You are my world.

1466
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:18,748
No.

1467
02:37:22,120 --> 02:37:24,509
Please. Clark!

1468
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:30,600
Hi.

1469
02:44:37,799 --> 02:44:41,031
Clark had this sent here,
so he could surprise you.

1470
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:09,111
"The dead shall live.

1471
02:47:10,600 --> 02:47:13,956
"My slain shall rise again.

1472
02:47:16,600 --> 02:47:19,672
"Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust.

1473
02:47:20,879 --> 02:47:24,350
"For thy dew is like the dew of morning.

1474
02:47:26,200 --> 02:47:31,193
"And the earth
shall give birth to her dead."

1475
02:47:38,719 --> 02:47:40,870
Ah, I need a ride
back to the house.

1476
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:43,712
I forgot my checkbook
to pay the funeral director.

1477
02:47:43,879 --> 02:47:45,870
They said it's all taken care of.

1478
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:47,870
By whom?

1479
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:49,631
Anonymous donor.

1480
02:48:33,440 --> 02:48:37,513
All those circuses back east
burying an empty box.

1481
02:48:37,680 --> 02:48:39,591
They don't know how to honor him,

1482
02:48:40,680 --> 02:48:42,591
except as a soldier.

1483
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:47,795
I've failed him in life.

1484
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:51,156
I won't fail him in death.

1485
02:48:52,879 --> 02:48:54,438
Help me find the others like you.

1486
02:48:55,559 --> 02:48:57,629
Perhaps they don't want to be found.

1487
02:48:58,479 --> 02:49:01,630
They will. And they'll fight.

1488
02:49:02,399 --> 02:49:04,868
We have to stand together.

1489
02:49:12,159 --> 02:49:15,789
100 years ago, I walked away from mankind.

1490
02:49:17,479 --> 02:49:20,313
From a century of horrors.

1491
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:26,788
Man made a world where
standing together is impossible.

1492
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,149
Men are still good.

1493
02:49:34,319 --> 02:49:37,153
<i>We fight. We kill.</i>

1494
02:49:38,239 --> 02:49:40,594
<i>We betray one another.</i>

1495
02:49:42,559 --> 02:49:44,754
<i>But we can rebuild.</i>

1496
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:47,909
<i>We can do better.</i>

1497
02:49:48,920 --> 02:49:50,433
<i>We will.</i>

1498
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:52,352
<i>We have to.</i>

1499
02:50:15,280 --> 02:50:16,871
The others like me.

1500
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:19,031
Why did you say they'll have to fight?

1501
02:50:24,559 --> 02:50:26,675
Just a feeling.

1502
02:50:37,959 --> 02:50:40,632
Prisoner A-C-23-19-40.

1503
02:50:40,799 --> 02:50:43,552
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1504
02:50:44,959 --> 02:50:46,836
I'm gonna say this one more time.

1505
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:50,389
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1506
02:50:57,600 --> 02:50:59,829
Turn around and face the wall.

1507
02:51:01,280 --> 02:51:03,747
Place your forehead against the wall.

1508
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:08,152
Put your hands behind your back,
so that I can come in and restrain you.

1509
02:51:36,200 --> 02:51:38,952
<i>Whatever you do, wherever you go,</i>

1510
02:51:39,120 --> 02:51:41,270
<i>I'll be watching you.</i>

1511
02:51:42,040 --> 02:51:43,359
Oh...

1512
02:51:44,639 --> 02:51:46,436
Look at us.

1513
02:51:47,239 --> 02:51:49,150
This is how it all caves in.

1514
02:51:49,360 --> 02:51:54,593
Civilization on the Wayne Manor's
out the window.

1515
02:51:55,280 --> 02:51:56,679
Mmm?

1516
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:01,270
But who would believe me?
I...

1517
02:52:01,959 --> 02:52:04,349
I'm insane.

1518
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:07,591
I'm not even fit to stand trial.

1519
02:52:07,760 --> 02:52:09,637
That's right.

1520
02:52:09,840 --> 02:52:13,753
We have hospitals that treat
the mentally ill with compassion.

1521
02:52:14,120 --> 02:52:16,917
But that's not where you're going.

1522
02:52:17,079 --> 02:52:20,594
I arranged for you to get transferred
to Arkham Asylum in Gotham.

1523
02:52:21,799 --> 02:52:24,268
I still have some friends there.

1524
02:52:24,440 --> 02:52:26,236
They're expecting you.

1525
02:52:30,479 --> 02:52:34,677
But the bell's already been rung.

1526
02:52:37,239 --> 02:52:38,753
And they've heard it.

1527
02:52:40,520 --> 02:52:41,918
Out in the dark.

1528
02:52:42,120 --> 02:52:44,680
Among the stars. Hmm.

1529
02:52:48,040 --> 02:52:51,748
Ding dong, the God is dead.

1530
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:03,952
But a bell cannot be unrung!

1531
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:08,793
He's hungry. He's found us.

1532
02:53:09,799 --> 02:53:11,790
And he's coming!

1533
02:53:14,680 --> 02:53:17,147
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1534
02:53:19,479 --> 02:53:22,358
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1535
02:53:24,319 --> 02:53:27,516
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1536
02:53:29,079 --> 02:53:30,798
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>

1537
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:37,037
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>

1538
02:53:38,799 --> 02:53:42,156
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>
