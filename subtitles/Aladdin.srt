1
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,005
<i>Oh l Come from a land,
From a faraway place</i>

2
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,240
<i>Where the Caravan Camels roam</i>

3
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,940
<i>Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense</i>

4
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,340
<i>It's barbaric but hey, it's home</i>

5
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,890
<i>When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west</i>

6
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,990
<i>And the sand in the glass is right</i>

7
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,240
<i>Come on down, stop on by,
hop a carpet and fly</i>

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,440
<i>To another Arabian night</i>

9
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,990
<i>Arabian nights</i>

10
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,540
<i>Like Arabian days</i>

11
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,240
<i>More often than not Are hotter than hot</i>

12
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,790
<i>ln a lot of good ways</i>

13
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,240
<i>Arabian nights</i>

14
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,790
<i>'Neath Arabian moons</i>

15
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,740
<i>A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard</i>

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,340
<i>Out there on the dunes</i>

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,440
Salam and good evening to you,
worthy friend.

18
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,540
Please come closer.

19
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,290
Too close. A little too close.

20
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,740
There.

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,090
Welcome to Agrabah

22
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,540
City of mystery

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,290
Of enchantment.

24
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,240
And the finest merchandise this side
of the river Jordan. Come on down.

25
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,771
Look at this. Combination hookah...

26
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:55,940
and coffee maker. Also
makes julienne fries.

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,040
Will not break.

28
00:01:58,128 --> 00:02:00,140
Lt broke.

29
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,990
Look at this. I have never seen
one of these intact before.

30
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,540
This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen.

31
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,640
Still good.

32
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:11,840
Wait, don't go!

33
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,740
I can see you're only interested
in the exceptionally rare.

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,770
I think, then, you would be
most rewarded to consider this.

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,540
Do not be fooled
by its commonplace appearance.

36
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,705
Like so many things,

37
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:28,990
it is not what is outside, but
what is inside that counts.

38
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,290
This is no ordinary lamp. lt
once changed the course...

39
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,640
of a young man's life.

40
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,690
A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than what he seemed.

41
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,190
A diamond in the rough.

42
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,340
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale?
Lt begins on a dark night.

43
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,440
Where a dark man waits
with a dark purpose.

44
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,390
You are late.

45
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,290
A thousand apologies, oh patient one.

46
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,290
You have it, then?
- I had to slit a few throats.

47
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,440
But I got it.

48
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,140
The treasure!

49
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,540
Trust me, my pungent friend.
You'll get what's coming to you.

50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,040
Quickly, follow the trail.

51
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
Faster!

52
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,790
At last, after all my years of searching.

53
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,740
Cave of Wonders.

54
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,140
By Allah.

55
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,240
Now, remember.
Bring me the lamp.

56
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,015
The rest of the treasure is yours,
but the lamp is mine.

57
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,390
The lamp.

58
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,540
Where did you dig this bozo up?

59
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:42,541
Who disturbs my slumber?

60
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:45,791
It is I. Gazeem.

61
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:47,891
A humble thief.

62
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:52,441
Know this. Only one may enter here.

63
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,691
One whose worth lies far within.

64
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,641
The diamond in the rough.

65
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:02,461
What are you waiting for? Go on.

66
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:25,241
Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.

67
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:34,441
I can't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

68
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:39,941
We're never going to get ahold
of that stupid lamp.

69
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:44,141
Look at this.
I'm so ticked off that I'm molting.

70
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:47,391
Patience, Iago. Patience.

71
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:51,241
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.

72
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:53,991
There's a big surprise.

73
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:57,841
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack
and die from that surprise.

74
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:02,241
What are we going to do?
We got a big problem here, a big...

75
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:04,341
Yes.

76
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,341
Only one may enter.

77
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:12,541
I must find this one,
this diamond in the rough.

78
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,391
Stop, thief!

79
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:19,241
I'll have your hands for
a trophy, street rat.

80
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:21,806
All this for a loaf of bread?

81
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:35,941
There he is!
- You won't get away so easily!

82
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,081
You think that was easy?

83
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:43,141
Over that way.
And you, follow me. We'll find him.

84
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:46,491
Morning, ladies.
- Getting into trouble early today,

85
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:48,041
aren't we, Aladdin?

86
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,291
Trouble? No way.
You're only in trouble if you get caught.

87
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,341
Gotcha.
- I'm in trouble.

88
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:59,191
Perfect timing, Abu.
As usual.

89
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,741
Let's get outta here.

90
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:03,191
Got to keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line

91
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,291
One swing ahead of the sword

92
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,591
I steal only what I can't afford

93
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:09,041
That's everything.

94
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:10,691
One jump ahead of the lawmen

95
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,791
That's all, and that's no joke

96
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,791
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke

97
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:17,991
Riffraff
- Street rat

98
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:19,891
Scoundrel
- Take that

99
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:23,891
Just a little snack, guys

100
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:27,741
Rip him open, take it back, guys

101
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:29,591
I Can take a hint Got to face the facts

102
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:31,391
You're my only friend, Abu
- Who?

103
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:35,191
Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom

104
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,841
He's become a one-man rise in crime

105
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:42,541
I'd blame parents,
Except he hasn't got 'em

106
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:46,991
Got to eat to live, got to steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got time

107
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,291
One jump ahead of the slowpokes,
One skip ahead of my doom

108
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:52,191
Next time, going to use a nom de plume

109
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,941
There he is.

110
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,441
One jump ahead of the hit men,
One hit ahead of the flock

111
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:01,196
I think I'll take a stroll Around the block

112
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,291
Stop, thief.
- Vandal.

113
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:04,991
Abu.
- Scandal.

114
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:09,091
Let's not be too hasty

115
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:12,991
Still I think he's rather tasty

116
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:16,241
Got to eat to live, got to steal to eat,
Otherwise We'd get along

117
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:18,341
Wrong

118
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:20,941
Get him!

119
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:28,141
He's got a sword.

120
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,741
You idiots.
We've all got swords.

121
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:42,441
One jump ahead of the hoof beats
One hop ahead of the hump

122
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:46,241
One trick ahead of disaster,
They're quick but I'm much faster

123
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:48,691
Here goes, better throw my hand in,
Wish me happy landing

124
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,441
All I got to do is jump!

125
00:08:56,541 --> 00:09:00,241
Crazy Hakim's DISCOUNT FERTILIZER

126
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:08,241
And now my esteemed Effendi feast away.

127
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:32,991
Here.

128
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:35,141
Go on take it.

129
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:51,441
Oh, no!

130
00:09:57,941 --> 00:10:00,491
On his way to the palace, I suppose.

131
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:03,941
Another suitor for the princess.

132
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,241
Out of my way, you filthy brats.

133
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:13,741
Hey! if I were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.

134
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:16,641
I'll teach you some manners!

135
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:22,166
Look at that, Abu.

136
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:26,641
It's not every day you see
a horse with two rear ends.

137
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:29,241
You are a worthless street rat.

138
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:32,591
You were born a street rat,
you'll die a street rat

139
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:35,741
and only your fleas will mourn you.

140
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:42,841
I'm not worthless.
And I don't have fleas.

141
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:48,841
Come on, Abu. Let's go home.

142
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:58,091
Riffraff, street rat

143
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,541
I don't buy that

144
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:05,041
If only they'd look closer

145
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:08,291
Would they see a poor boy?

146
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:10,391
No siree

147
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,291
They'd find out

148
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:22,641
There's so much more to me

149
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:31,041
Some day, Abu,
things are going to change.

150
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:36,751
We'll be rich, live in a palace
and never have any problems at all.

151
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:43,541
I've never been so insulted.
- Prince Achmed.

152
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:46,091
You're not leaving so soon, are you?

153
00:11:46,191 --> 00:11:48,486
Good luck marrying her off.

154
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,241
Jasmine.

155
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:00,041
Confound it, Rajah.

156
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,191
So this is why Prince Achmed stormed out.

157
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:10,541
Oh, Father. Rajah was just playing
with him. Weren't you, Rajah?

158
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:14,331
You were just playing
with that overdressed,

159
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:17,916
self-absorbed Prince Achmed, weren't you?

160
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:23,491
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes to call.

161
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:29,291
The law says you must be married
to a prince by your next birthday.

162
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:32,991
The law is wrong.
- You've only got three more days.

163
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:36,541
Father, I hate being forced into this.

164
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:39,791
If I do marry,
I want it to be for love.

165
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:45,242
Jasmine, it's not only this law.

166
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:49,712
I'm not going to be around forever, and...

167
00:12:51,342 --> 00:12:55,192
I just want to make sure
you're taken care of.

168
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:59,142
Provided for.
- Please try to understand.

169
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:04,242
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.

170
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:06,892
Except you, Rajah.

171
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:10,092
I've never even been
outside the palace walls.

172
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:12,912
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

173
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:17,087
Then maybe I don't want to be
a princess anymore.

174
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:22,012
Allah forbid you should
have any daughters.

175
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:39,992
I don't know where she gets it from.
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

176
00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:46,142
Jafar, my most trusted advisor.

177
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,942
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.

178
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:51,892
My life is but to serve you, my lord.

179
00:13:51,992 --> 00:13:56,142
It's this suitor business.
Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.

180
00:13:56,242 --> 00:13:58,242
I'm at my wits' end.

181
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:04,107
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.

182
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:09,592
Your Majesty certainly
has a way with dumb animals.

183
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:16,142
Now, then. Perhaps I can
divine a solution to this thorny problem.

184
00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:18,292
If anyone can help, it's you.

185
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:23,067
But it would require
the use of the mystic blue diamond.

186
00:14:23,742 --> 00:14:25,742
My ring?

187
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:31,192
But it's been in the family for years.
- Lt is necessary to find a suitor.

188
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:32,992
Don't worry.

189
00:14:33,092 --> 00:14:36,342
Everything will be fine.

190
00:14:39,142 --> 00:14:41,192
The diamond.

191
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:43,492
Here, Jafar.

192
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:47,092
Whatever you need will be fine.

193
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:49,692
You are most gracious, my liege.

194
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:53,532
Now run along
and play with your little toys.

195
00:14:54,842 --> 00:14:57,942
That will be pretty good.

196
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:01,892
I can't take it anymore.

197
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:08,027
If I gotta choke down on one more
of those moldy, disgusting crackers...

198
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,942
Calm yourself, Iago.

199
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:17,122
Soon I will be sultan,
not that addle-pated twit.

200
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:21,942
And then I stuff the crackers
down his throat.

201
00:15:39,442 --> 00:15:45,742
I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here
and have my life lived for me.

202
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:49,442
I'll miss you.

203
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:59,542
Goodbye.

204
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:09,592
Jaffa oranges!

205
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:11,692
OK Abu, go!

206
00:16:12,942 --> 00:16:17,242
Try this! Your taste buds
will dance and sing.

207
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:21,192
Hey, get your paws off!

208
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:26,242
Get away from here.
You dirty dirty ape!

209
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:29,092
Bye-bye!

210
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:31,192
Let's go on, Abu!

211
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,342
Breakfast is served.

212
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:42,342
Pretty lady, buy a pot.
No finer pot in brass or silver.

213
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:46,942
Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs.
Sugar dates and pistachios.

214
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:51,042
Would the lady like a necklace?
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

215
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:53,642
Fresh fish. We catch 'em, you buy them.

216
00:16:53,742 --> 00:16:56,142
No. I don't think so.

217
00:16:57,342 --> 00:16:59,342
Excuse me.

218
00:17:03,142 --> 00:17:06,142
I'm really very sorry.

219
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:18,442
Hello?

220
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:23,042
You must be hungry.

221
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:27,742
Here you go.
- You'd better be able to pay for that.

222
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:31,042
Pay?
- No one steals from my cart.

223
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:33,592
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.

224
00:17:33,692 --> 00:17:35,192
Thief!
- Please.

225
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:38,242
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the sultan.

226
00:17:38,342 --> 00:17:41,292
Do you know what
the penalty is for stealing?

227
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:42,892
No, please!

228
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:46,542
Thank you, kind sir.
I'm so glad you found her.

229
00:17:46,642 --> 00:17:48,692
I've been looking for you.
- What are you doing?

230
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:52,042
Just play along.
- You know this girl?

231
00:17:52,142 --> 00:17:54,942
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.

232
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:59,142
She's a little crazy.
- She said she knew the sultan.

233
00:17:59,242 --> 00:18:02,302
She thinks the monkey is the sultan.

234
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:08,142
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?

235
00:18:10,442 --> 00:18:12,542
Tragic, isn't it?

236
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:14,792
But no harm done.

237
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:17,442
Come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.

238
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:21,892
Hello, doctor. How are you?
- No, not that one.

239
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:24,042
Come on, Sultan.

240
00:18:26,642 --> 00:18:28,392
What is it?

241
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:31,467
Come back here, you little thieves.

242
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:37,892
With all due respect,
Your Rottenness,

243
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:41,342
couldn't we just wait for a real storm?

244
00:18:41,442 --> 00:18:44,077
Save your breath, Iago. Faster.

245
00:18:44,242 --> 00:18:47,142
Yes, oh mighty evil one.

246
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:52,292
Part, sands of time.

247
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:56,242
Reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.

248
00:18:56,342 --> 00:18:59,492
Yes.

249
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:01,892
There he is.

250
00:19:01,992 --> 00:19:04,292
My diamond in the rough.

251
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:07,892
That's him? That's the clown
we've been waiting for?

252
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:12,842
Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace.

253
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:15,942
Shall we?
- Swell.

254
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:22,242
Almost there.

255
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:32,942
I want to thank you for stopping that man.

256
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:35,392
Forget it.

257
00:19:35,492 --> 00:19:39,742
So this is your first time
in the marketplace, huh?

258
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:42,792
Ls it that obvious?

259
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:45,527
Well, you do kind of stand out.

260
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:51,657
I mean, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

261
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:55,242
I'm a fast learner.

262
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:01,842
Come on. This way.

263
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:06,192
Watch your head there.
Be careful.

264
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:10,042
Ls this where you live?
- Yep. Just me and Abu.

265
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,142
Come and go as we please.
- That sounds fabulous.

266
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:15,342
Well, it's not much.

267
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:18,092
But it's got a great view.

268
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:21,337
The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?

269
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:23,892
It's wonderful.

270
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:28,492
Wonder what it'd be like to live there.
And have servants and valets.

271
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:33,142
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

272
00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:37,292
That's better than here. Always
scraping for food and ducking guards.

273
00:20:37,392 --> 00:20:39,492
You're not free to make your own choices.

274
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:41,792
Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...

275
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,892
trapped.

276
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:50,542
So where are you from?

277
00:20:51,343 --> 00:20:55,543
What does it matter?
I ran away and I am not going back.

278
00:20:55,643 --> 00:20:57,643
Really? How come?

279
00:20:57,731 --> 00:20:59,843
Why, you...

280
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:04,373
My father's forcing me to get married.

281
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:06,743
That's awful.

282
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:13,043
What?

283
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,593
Abu says...

284
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:17,543
it is not fair.

285
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,443
Oh, did he?
- Yeah. Of course.

286
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:24,293
And does Abu have anything else to say?

287
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:27,493
He wishes there was something
he could do to help.

288
00:21:27,593 --> 00:21:29,593
Oh, boy.

289
00:21:31,343 --> 00:21:34,843
Tell him that's very sweet.

290
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:38,193
Here you are.

291
00:21:38,293 --> 00:21:40,493
They're after me.
- They're after you?

292
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:44,343
My father must have sent them...
- Do you trust me?

293
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:46,643
Yes.
- Then jump!

294
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:57,373
We just keep running into each other,
don't we, street rat?

295
00:21:57,543 --> 00:21:59,743
Run. Go, get out of here.

296
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:04,293
It's the dungeon for you, boy.

297
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:06,043
Get off.
- Let him go.

298
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:09,843
Looky here, men.
A street mouse.

299
00:22:10,543 --> 00:22:12,193
Unhand him.

300
00:22:12,293 --> 00:22:14,418
By order of the princess!

301
00:22:15,743 --> 00:22:18,463
Princess Jasmine.
- The princess?

302
00:22:18,843 --> 00:22:21,943
What are you doing here?
And with this street rat?

303
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:26,093
That's not your concern.
Do as I command. Release him.

304
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:29,793
I would, Princess.
Except my orders come from Jafar.

305
00:22:29,893 --> 00:22:34,653
You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, I will.

306
00:22:39,643 --> 00:22:41,393
Jafar?

307
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,493
Princess.

308
00:22:43,943 --> 00:22:47,843
Jafar, I'm stuck.
- How may I be of service to you?

309
00:22:47,943 --> 00:22:51,743
The guards took a boy from the market.
On your orders.

310
00:22:51,843 --> 00:22:54,893
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

311
00:22:54,993 --> 00:22:57,793
The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

312
00:22:57,893 --> 00:23:00,393
I can't breathe.
- Why...

313
00:23:00,493 --> 00:23:04,993
kidnapping the princess, of course.
- If you could just... That hurt!

314
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,343
He didn't kidnap me.
I ran away.

315
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:10,543
Oh, dear.

316
00:23:10,643 --> 00:23:14,793
How frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known...

317
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,543
What do you mean?

318
00:23:16,643 --> 00:23:19,543
Sadly, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.

319
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:22,143
What sentence?
- Death.

320
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:25,343
By beheading.
- No.

321
00:23:28,343 --> 00:23:31,743
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.

322
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,843
How could you!

323
00:23:43,943 --> 00:23:45,693
So. How did it go?

324
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:49,443
I think she took it rather well.

325
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:04,343
It's all my fault, Raja.

326
00:24:06,643 --> 00:24:09,023
I didn't even know his name.

327
00:24:27,643 --> 00:24:29,743
She was the princess.

328
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,343
I can't believe it.

329
00:24:32,443 --> 00:24:35,588
I must have sounded so stupid to her.

330
00:24:39,043 --> 00:24:41,043
Abu, down here.

331
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:45,693
Come on, help me out of these.

332
00:24:51,743 --> 00:24:53,743
She was in trouble.

333
00:24:53,831 --> 00:24:55,843
She was worth it.

334
00:24:56,743 --> 00:24:59,293
Don't worry, I'll never see her again.

335
00:24:59,393 --> 00:25:02,643
I'm a street rat, remember,
and there's a law.

336
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:05,123
She's got to marry a prince.

337
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:08,593
She deserves a prince.

338
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:10,893
I'm a fool.

339
00:25:10,993 --> 00:25:14,843
You're only a fool if you give up, boy.

340
00:25:14,943 --> 00:25:19,293
Who are you?
- A lowly prisoner like yourself.

341
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:22,453
But together perhaps we can be more.

342
00:25:22,538 --> 00:25:26,243
I'm listening.
- There is a cave, boy.

343
00:25:26,343 --> 00:25:28,393
A cave of wonders,

344
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:32,943
filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

345
00:25:34,343 --> 00:25:37,943
Treasure enough to impress even
your princess, I'd wager.

346
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:41,243
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dying in here.

347
00:25:41,343 --> 00:25:46,243
But the law says that only a prince...

348
00:25:46,343 --> 00:25:49,843
Haven't you heard of the golden rule?
Whoever has the gold makes the rules.

349
00:25:49,943 --> 00:25:52,793
So why would you share
this treasure with me?

350
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:58,043
I need a young pair of legs
and a strong back to go in after it.

351
00:25:58,143 --> 00:26:01,968
One problem.
It's out there and we're in here.

352
00:26:02,743 --> 00:26:05,803
Things aren't always what they seem.

353
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:10,943
So. Do we have a deal?

354
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:28,143
Who disturbs my slumber?

355
00:26:29,743 --> 00:26:32,143
It is I. Aladdin.

356
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:36,093
Proceed.

357
00:26:36,193 --> 00:26:39,943
Touch nothing but the lamp.

358
00:26:40,043 --> 00:26:42,993
Remember, boy.
First fetch me the lamp.

359
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:46,893
And then you shall have your reward.

360
00:26:46,993 --> 00:26:48,993
Come on, Abu.

361
00:27:02,243 --> 00:27:04,843
Would you look at that!

362
00:27:07,343 --> 00:27:12,868
Just a handful of this stuff
would make me richer than the sultan.

363
00:27:14,543 --> 00:27:17,093
Don't touch anything.

364
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:19,318
We got to find that lamp.

365
00:27:49,943 --> 00:27:52,443
Will you knock it off?

366
00:28:15,143 --> 00:28:17,143
Are you crazy?

367
00:28:19,043 --> 00:28:21,943
A magic carpet.

368
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:25,443
Come on out.
We're not going to hurt you.

369
00:28:34,243 --> 00:28:37,493
Take it easy.
He's not going to bite.

370
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:39,643
Thanks.

371
00:28:46,543 --> 00:28:48,693
Wait a minute, don't go.

372
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,843
Maybe you can help us.

373
00:28:55,243 --> 00:28:58,643
You see, we're trying to find this lamp.

374
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:01,509
I think he knows where it is.

375
00:29:16,944 --> 00:29:18,944
Wait here.

376
00:29:50,944 --> 00:29:55,959
This is it? This is what we came
all the way down here to...

377
00:29:57,244 --> 00:29:58,594
No!

378
00:29:58,694 --> 00:30:01,394
Infidels!

379
00:30:01,494 --> 00:30:06,544
You have touched the forbidden treasure.

380
00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:14,944
Now you will never again
see the light of day.

381
00:30:47,444 --> 00:30:49,844
Carpet, let's move.

382
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:08,144
This is no time to panic.

383
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,744
Start panicking.

384
00:31:40,644 --> 00:31:42,844
Help me up.
- Throw me the lamp.

385
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:45,344
I can't hold on.
Give me your hand.

386
00:31:45,444 --> 00:31:47,444
First give me the lamp.

387
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,894
Yes!

388
00:31:54,994 --> 00:31:57,544
At last!

389
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:04,144
What are you doing?
- Giving you your reward.

390
00:32:04,244 --> 00:32:07,044
Your eternal reward.

391
00:32:33,644 --> 00:32:37,844
It's mine! It's all mine!

392
00:32:37,944 --> 00:32:40,294
I... where is it?

393
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:42,394
No.

394
00:32:53,044 --> 00:32:56,444
Oh dearest. What's wrong?

395
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:03,094
Jafar has done something terrible.

396
00:33:03,194 --> 00:33:05,794
There, there my dear.

397
00:33:05,894 --> 00:33:07,994
We will set it right

398
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:10,744
Now, tell me everything.

399
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:18,244
Wake up!

400
00:33:20,744 --> 00:33:22,744
My head.

401
00:33:24,844 --> 00:33:29,744
We're trapped.
That two-faced son of a jackal.

402
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:34,179
Well, whoever he was,
he's long gone with that lamp.

403
00:33:37,044 --> 00:33:39,894
Why, you hairy little thief.

404
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:43,344
Lt looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece of junk.

405
00:33:43,444 --> 00:33:46,759
I think there's something written here,

406
00:33:47,144 --> 00:33:49,354
but it's hard to make out.

407
00:34:04,444 --> 00:34:09,544
Ten thousand years will give you
such a crick in the neck.

408
00:34:09,644 --> 00:34:12,044
Hang on a second.

409
00:34:12,944 --> 00:34:15,794
Wow, does it feel good to be out of there.

410
00:34:15,894 --> 00:34:20,944
Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.
Where are you from? What's your name?

411
00:34:21,044 --> 00:34:22,444
Aladdin.

412
00:34:22,544 --> 00:34:26,594
Nice to have you on the show.
Can we call you Al? Or maybe just Din?

413
00:34:26,694 --> 00:34:31,144
How about Laddie? Sounds like
"Here, boy." Come on, Laddie.

414
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:33,794
I must've hit my head
harder than I thought.

415
00:34:33,894 --> 00:34:36,189
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?

416
00:34:36,644 --> 00:34:39,544
Sorry, Cheetah,
I hope I didn't singe the fur.

417
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:45,084
Rugman, haven't seen you
in a few millennia. Give me some tassel.

418
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:50,244
You're smaller than my last master.
Either that or I'm getting bigger.

419
00:34:50,344 --> 00:34:52,394
Look at me from the side.
Do I look different to you?

420
00:34:52,494 --> 00:34:55,044
Wait a minute. I am your master?

421
00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:57,444
That's right. He can be taught.

422
00:34:57,544 --> 00:35:00,394
What would you wish of me?
The ever-impressive,

423
00:35:00,494 --> 00:35:03,394
the long-contained,

424
00:35:03,494 --> 00:35:07,844
often imitated,
but never duplicated...

425
00:35:08,844 --> 00:35:12,544
Genie of the Lamp!

426
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:14,306
Right here, direct from the lamp.

427
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:16,794
Right here for your very
much wish-fulfillment.

428
00:35:16,894 --> 00:35:18,894
Thank you.

429
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:21,544
Wish-fulfillment?
- Three, to be exact.

430
00:35:21,644 --> 00:35:23,994
Ix-nay on the wishing for more wishes.

431
00:35:24,094 --> 00:35:26,894
That's it. Three.

432
00:35:26,994 --> 00:35:30,224
No substitutions,
exchanges or refunds.

433
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:33,944
Now I know I'm dreaming.
- You don't realize what you got here.

434
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:39,824
So why don't you just ruminate
whilst I illuminate the possibilities?

435
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:42,494
Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves

436
00:35:42,594 --> 00:35:44,694
Scheherazade had a thousand tales

437
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:47,194
But, master, you're in luck
'cause up your sleeves

438
00:35:47,294 --> 00:35:49,594
You got a brand of magic never fails

439
00:35:49,694 --> 00:35:51,994
You got some power in your corner now

440
00:35:52,094 --> 00:35:54,594
Some heavy ammunition in your camp

441
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,744
You got some punch, pizzazz,
Yahoo and how

442
00:35:56,844 --> 00:35:59,694
See, all you got to do
ls rub that lamp and I'll say

443
00:35:59,794 --> 00:36:04,044
Mr, Aladdin, sir,
what will your pleasure be?

444
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:06,394
Let me take your order, jot it down

445
00:36:06,494 --> 00:36:09,244
You ain't never had a friend like me

446
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:13,444
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maître d'

447
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:15,494
Come on, whisper what it is you want

448
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:17,694
You ain't never had a friend like me

449
00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:20,294
Yes, sir, we pride ourselves on service

450
00:36:20,394 --> 00:36:22,694
You're the boss, the king, the shah

451
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:24,994
Say what you wish,
It's yours, true dish

452
00:36:25,094 --> 00:36:28,194
How 'bout a little more baklawa?

453
00:36:28,294 --> 00:36:32,444
Have some of Column A,
Try all of Column B

454
00:36:32,544 --> 00:36:34,444
I'm in the mood to help you, dude

455
00:36:34,544 --> 00:36:37,604
You ain't never had a friend like me

456
00:36:46,044 --> 00:36:47,994
Can your friends do this?

457
00:36:48,094 --> 00:36:50,344
Can your friends do that?

458
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:52,744
Can your friends pull this

459
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:55,094
Out their little hat?

460
00:36:55,194 --> 00:36:57,544
Can your friends go...

461
00:36:57,644 --> 00:36:59,644
Hey, looky here

462
00:37:00,044 --> 00:37:02,894
Can your friends go
Abracadabra, let her rip

463
00:37:02,994 --> 00:37:05,194
And then make the sucker disappear?

464
00:37:05,294 --> 00:37:07,794
So don't just sit there
Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed

465
00:37:07,894 --> 00:37:09,794
I'm here to answer
All your midnight prayers

466
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,995
You got me bona fide, certified

467
00:37:12,095 --> 00:37:14,395
You got a genie For a chargé d'affaires

468
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:16,695
I got a powerful urge to help you out

469
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:18,795
So what's your wish?
I really want to know

470
00:37:18,895 --> 00:37:20,995
You got a list that's
Three miles long, no doubt

471
00:37:21,095 --> 00:37:24,145
Well, all you got to do is rub like so

472
00:37:24,245 --> 00:37:28,145
Mr, Aladdin, sir,
have a wish or two or three

473
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:30,345
I'm on the job, you big nabob

474
00:37:30,445 --> 00:37:32,825
You ain't never had a friend

475
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:39,045
You ain't never had a friend Like me

476
00:37:39,145 --> 00:37:42,205
You ain't never had a friend like me

477
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:51,745
Applause

478
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:57,245
So what'll it be, Master?

479
00:37:57,345 --> 00:38:01,045
You're gonna grant me
any three wishes I want, right?

480
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,145
Almost.

481
00:38:02,245 --> 00:38:05,345
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.

482
00:38:05,445 --> 00:38:06,545
Like?

483
00:38:06,645 --> 00:38:08,895
Rule one. I can't kill anybody.

484
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,995
So don't ask.

485
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:16,255
Rule two. I can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.

486
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:18,297
You little punim there.

487
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:22,445
Rule three.
I can't bring people back from the dead.

488
00:38:22,545 --> 00:38:25,745
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.

489
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,225
Other than that, you got it.

490
00:38:31,745 --> 00:38:36,145
Provisos? You mean limitations?
On wishes?

491
00:38:36,245 --> 00:38:37,699
Some all-powerful genie!

492
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:40,445
Can't even bring people
back from the dead.

493
00:38:40,545 --> 00:38:43,895
I don't know. He probably can't even
get us out of this cave.

494
00:38:43,995 --> 00:38:46,195
Looks like we'll have to find a way out.

495
00:38:46,295 --> 00:38:48,045
Excuse me.

496
00:38:48,145 --> 00:38:50,895
Are you looking at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

497
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,845
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

498
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:57,245
And you're walking out on me?
I don't think so.

499
00:38:57,345 --> 00:39:01,935
Not right now.
You're getting your wishes, so sit down.

500
00:39:02,245 --> 00:39:05,245
Ln case of emergency,
the exits are here.

501
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:08,545
Anywhere. Keep your hands
and arms inside the carpet.

502
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:10,645
We're...

503
00:39:11,045 --> 00:39:13,145
out of here.

504
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:17,095
Jafar, this is an outrage.

505
00:39:17,195 --> 00:39:20,145
If it weren't for all your years
of loyal service...

506
00:39:20,245 --> 00:39:24,345
From now on, you're to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me.

507
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,845
Before they are beheaded.

508
00:39:26,945 --> 00:39:29,745
I assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.

509
00:39:29,845 --> 00:39:35,845
Jasmine, Jafar, now let's put
this whole messy business behind us.

510
00:39:35,945 --> 00:39:36,995
Please.

511
00:39:37,095 --> 00:39:41,445
My most abject and humblest
apologies to you as well, Princess.

512
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,395
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.

513
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:49,255
When I am queen,
I will have the power to get rid of you.

514
00:39:50,045 --> 00:39:52,345
That's nice. All settled, then.

515
00:39:52,445 --> 00:39:56,865
Now, Jasmine,
getting back to this suitor business...

516
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:03,545
If only I had gotten that lamp.

517
00:40:03,645 --> 00:40:07,245
"I will have the power
to get rid of you."

518
00:40:07,345 --> 00:40:13,295
To think we gotta keep kissing up
to that chump and his chump daughter

519
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:15,345
for the rest of our lives.

520
00:40:15,445 --> 00:40:19,795
No, Iago. Only until she finds
a chump husband.

521
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:22,360
Then she'll have us banished.

522
00:40:22,444 --> 00:40:24,445
Or beheaded!

523
00:40:27,045 --> 00:40:28,695
Wait a minute!

524
00:40:28,795 --> 00:40:31,895
What if you were the chump husband?

525
00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:33,395
What?

526
00:40:33,495 --> 00:40:36,195
You marry the princess, right?

527
00:40:36,295 --> 00:40:40,145
And then you become the sultan.

528
00:40:41,645 --> 00:40:43,845
Marry the shrew.

529
00:40:43,945 --> 00:40:45,945
I become the sultan.

530
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:48,033
The idea has merit.

531
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:49,495
Yes, merit, yes.

532
00:40:49,595 --> 00:40:55,945
And then we drop papa-in-law and
the little woman off a cliff.

533
00:41:01,145 --> 00:41:04,800
I love the way your foul little mind works.

534
00:41:12,745 --> 00:41:16,845
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.

535
00:41:16,945 --> 00:41:20,495
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.

536
00:41:20,595 --> 00:41:23,645
Thank you. Goodbye, now.
Goodbye, thank you.

537
00:41:23,745 --> 00:41:27,595
Well, how about that,
Mr. Doubting Mustafa?

538
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:29,695
You sure showed me.

539
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:32,295
Now about my three wishes...

540
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:34,245
Dost mine ears deceive me?

541
00:41:34,345 --> 00:41:37,795
Three? You are down by one, boy.

542
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:41,145
No, I never actually wished
to get out of the cave.

543
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:43,370
You did that on your own.

544
00:41:44,845 --> 00:41:46,945
I feel sheepish.

545
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:50,195
All right, you bad boy.
But no more freebies.

546
00:41:50,295 --> 00:41:51,895
Fair deal.

547
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:55,395
Three wishes.
I want them to be good.

548
00:41:55,495 --> 00:41:57,145
What would you wish for?

549
00:41:57,245 --> 00:41:59,095
Me?

550
00:41:59,195 --> 00:42:01,245
No one's asked me that before.

551
00:42:01,345 --> 00:42:03,195
Well, in my case...

552
00:42:03,295 --> 00:42:04,995
Forget it.
- What?

553
00:42:05,095 --> 00:42:07,390
I can't tell you.
- Come on.

554
00:42:08,245 --> 00:42:10,345
Freedom.

555
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:13,745
You're a prisoner?
- It's part of the whole genie gig.

556
00:42:13,845 --> 00:42:16,645
Phenomenal cosmic power.

557
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:21,045
Itty-bitty living space.
- Genie, that's terrible.

558
00:42:21,145 --> 00:42:23,945
But oh, to be free.

559
00:42:24,045 --> 00:42:27,445
Not to have to go, "What do you need?"

560
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,145
To be my own master.

561
00:42:30,245 --> 00:42:36,245
Such a thing would be greater than all
the magic and treasures in the world.

562
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:39,945
But what am I talking about?
It's not going to happen.

563
00:42:40,045 --> 00:42:43,645
Wake up and smell the hummus.
- Why not?

564
00:42:43,745 --> 00:42:47,395
The only way I get out of this
is if my master wishes me out.

565
00:42:47,495 --> 00:42:49,995
So you can guess
how often that's happened.

566
00:42:50,095 --> 00:42:51,895
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

567
00:42:51,995 --> 00:42:54,045
Yeah, right!

568
00:42:54,445 --> 00:43:00,345
I promise. After my first two wishes,
I'll use my third wish to set you free.

569
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:02,795
Well, here's hoping.

570
00:43:02,895 --> 00:43:05,195
Let's make some magic.

571
00:43:05,295 --> 00:43:07,845
So how about it?
What is it you want most?

572
00:43:07,945 --> 00:43:11,745
Well, there's this girl.

573
00:43:11,945 --> 00:43:15,445
Wrong. I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

574
00:43:15,545 --> 00:43:19,845
But, Genie, she's smart and fun and...

575
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:21,795
Pretty?
- Beautiful.

576
00:43:21,895 --> 00:43:24,895
She's got these eyes that just...
and this hair.

577
00:43:24,995 --> 00:43:27,445
And her smile...

578
00:43:30,945 --> 00:43:36,300
But she's the princess.
To even have a chance, I'd have to be...

579
00:43:36,445 --> 00:43:39,245
Can you make me a prince?
- Let's see.

580
00:43:39,345 --> 00:43:41,345
Chicken à la King.

581
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:43,895
No. Alaskan king crab.

582
00:43:43,995 --> 00:43:46,295
I hate it when they do that.
Caesar salad.

583
00:43:46,395 --> 00:43:48,695
Et tu, Brute? No.

584
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:50,895
"To make a prince."

585
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,245
ls that official?
Say the magic words.

586
00:43:53,345 --> 00:43:56,095
Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince.

587
00:43:56,195 --> 00:43:58,195
All right!

588
00:43:58,745 --> 00:44:02,595
First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third-century.

589
00:44:02,695 --> 00:44:03,700
These patches.

590
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,045
What are we trying to say,
beggar? No. Work with me here.

591
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,145
I like it!

592
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,095
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?

593
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:15,795
Lt says, "Mode of transportation."

594
00:44:15,895 --> 00:44:18,945
Excuse me. Monkey boy.
Over here.

595
00:44:19,745 --> 00:44:23,695
Here he comes. And what better way
to make your grand entrance

596
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:27,345
than riding your very own
brand-new camel?

597
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:29,445
Watch out, they spit!

598
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,595
Not enough.

599
00:44:31,695 --> 00:44:34,585
Still not enough.
What do you need?

600
00:44:36,645 --> 00:44:39,945
Yes. Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.

601
00:44:42,145 --> 00:44:46,395
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.

602
00:44:52,045 --> 00:44:53,695
Abu, you look good.

603
00:44:53,795 --> 00:44:58,045
He's got the outfit, he's got
the elephant, but we're not through yet.

604
00:44:58,145 --> 00:45:03,160
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're going to make you a star.

605
00:45:05,445 --> 00:45:07,445
Now, let's see.

606
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:14,645
Sire, I have found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.

607
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,695
The problem with your daughter!

608
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:19,895
Really?
- Right here.

609
00:45:19,995 --> 00:45:24,146
If the princess has not chosen a husband
by the appointed time,

610
00:45:24,246 --> 00:45:27,046
then the sultan shall choose for her.

611
00:45:27,146 --> 00:45:32,196
But Jasmine hated all those suitors.
How could I choose someone she hates?

612
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,441
Not to worry, my liege.
There is more.

613
00:45:35,646 --> 00:45:39,946
If in the event a suitable prince
cannot be found,

614
00:45:40,046 --> 00:45:43,046
a princess must then be wed to...

615
00:45:45,646 --> 00:45:48,546
Interesting.
- What? Who?

616
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:50,646
The royal vizier.

617
00:45:50,734 --> 00:45:52,734
That would be...

618
00:45:52,784 --> 00:45:54,896
me.

619
00:45:54,996 --> 00:45:59,946
But I thought only a prince
can marry a princess. I'm quite sure.

620
00:46:00,046 --> 00:46:04,466
Desperate times call
for desperate measures, my lord.

621
00:46:04,946 --> 00:46:07,096
Desperate measures.

622
00:46:07,196 --> 00:46:11,196
You will order the princess to marry me.

623
00:46:11,296 --> 00:46:15,746
I will order the princess to...

624
00:46:16,446 --> 00:46:18,446
But you're so old.

625
00:46:18,534 --> 00:46:22,046
The princess will marry me!

626
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:24,356
The princess will marry...

627
00:46:24,846 --> 00:46:27,846
What is that? That music?

628
00:46:31,746 --> 00:46:34,636
Jafar, you must come and see this.

629
00:46:37,146 --> 00:46:41,646
Make way for Prince Ali

630
00:46:42,146 --> 00:46:46,746
Say hey, it's Prince Ali

631
00:46:47,646 --> 00:46:49,496
Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar

632
00:46:49,596 --> 00:46:51,996
Hey you, let us through,
It's a bright new star

633
00:46:52,096 --> 00:46:56,546
Oh come, be the first
On your block to meet his eye

634
00:46:57,046 --> 00:46:59,696
Make way, here he comes,
Ring bells, bang the drums

635
00:46:59,796 --> 00:47:01,496
You're going to love this guy

636
00:47:01,596 --> 00:47:06,546
Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa

637
00:47:06,646 --> 00:47:11,446
Genuflect, show some respect,
Down on one knee

638
00:47:11,546 --> 00:47:13,696
Now try your best to stay calm

639
00:47:13,796 --> 00:47:15,746
Brush up your Sunday salam

640
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:19,696
Then Come and meet
His spectacular coterie

641
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:24,896
Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa

642
00:47:24,996 --> 00:47:29,446
Strong as ten regular men definitely

643
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,446
He faced the galloping hordes

644
00:47:31,546 --> 00:47:33,696
A hundred bad guys with swords

645
00:47:33,796 --> 00:47:38,131
Who sent those goons to their Lords?
Why, Prince Ali

646
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:41,346
He's got 75 golden camels

647
00:47:41,446 --> 00:47:43,296
Don't they look lovely, June?

648
00:47:43,396 --> 00:47:45,246
Purple peacocks he's got 53

649
00:47:45,346 --> 00:47:47,296
Fabulous. I love the feathers.

650
00:47:47,396 --> 00:47:51,596
When it comes to exotic-type mammals

651
00:47:51,696 --> 00:47:53,396
Has he got a zoo, I'm telling you

652
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,696
It's a world-class menagerie

653
00:47:55,796 --> 00:47:59,996
Prince Ali, handsome is he, Ali Ababwa

654
00:48:00,096 --> 00:48:04,246
That physique, how Can I speak?
Weak at the knees

655
00:48:04,346 --> 00:48:06,646
Well, get on out in that square

656
00:48:06,746 --> 00:48:08,546
Adjust your veil and prepare

657
00:48:08,646 --> 00:48:13,246
To gawk and grovel And stare at Prince Ali

658
00:48:13,346 --> 00:48:17,646
He's got 95 White Persian monkeys

659
00:48:17,746 --> 00:48:22,046
To view them he charges no fee

660
00:48:22,146 --> 00:48:25,346
He's got slaves,
He's got servants and flunkeys

661
00:48:25,446 --> 00:48:28,096
Proud to work for him,
They bow to his whim, love serving him

662
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:31,846
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali

663
00:48:31,946 --> 00:48:34,596
Prince Ali

664
00:48:34,696 --> 00:48:40,996
Prince Ali, amorous he, Ali Ababwa

665
00:48:41,096 --> 00:48:45,746
Heard your princess
was a sight lovely to see

666
00:48:45,846 --> 00:48:47,296
And that, good people, is Why

667
00:48:47,396 --> 00:48:49,596
He got dolled up and dropped by

668
00:48:49,696 --> 00:48:51,396
With 60 elephants, llamas galore

669
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:53,396
With bears and lions,
A brass band and more

670
00:48:53,496 --> 00:48:55,346
With his 40 fakirs His cooks, his bakers

671
00:48:55,446 --> 00:48:56,796
His birds that warble on key

672
00:48:56,896 --> 00:48:58,896
Make way

673
00:48:58,971 --> 00:49:02,946
For Prince Ali

674
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:09,246
Splendid! Absolutely marvelous!

675
00:49:10,846 --> 00:49:15,446
Your Majesty, I have journeyed from afar
to seek your daughter's hand.

676
00:49:15,546 --> 00:49:20,346
Prince Ali Ababwa. Of course.
I'm delighted to meet you.

677
00:49:20,446 --> 00:49:24,346
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted too.

678
00:49:24,446 --> 00:49:25,946
Ecstatic.

679
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:29,106
I'm afraid, Prince Abubu...
- Ababwa.

680
00:49:29,191 --> 00:49:33,146
Whatever. You cannot just parade
in here uninvited and expect to...

681
00:49:33,246 --> 00:49:36,986
By Allah, this is quite
a remarkable device.

682
00:49:38,046 --> 00:49:41,796
I don't suppose I might...

683
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:45,126
Why certainly, Your Majesty. Allow me.

684
00:49:45,646 --> 00:49:48,451
Sire. I must advise against this.

685
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:52,630
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

686
00:49:59,646 --> 00:50:04,546
Just where did you say you were from?

687
00:50:05,346 --> 00:50:08,746
Much farther than you've
traveled, I'm sure.

688
00:50:08,846 --> 00:50:10,846
Try me.
- Duck, Polly.

689
00:50:13,746 --> 00:50:16,646
Watch it, you dumb rug.

690
00:50:23,746 --> 00:50:25,746
Have a cracker.

691
00:50:26,446 --> 00:50:29,946
Out the way, I'm coming in to land.
Jafar, watch this.

692
00:50:30,046 --> 00:50:33,296
Spectacular, Your Highness.
- Lt was lovely.

693
00:50:33,396 --> 00:50:36,626
Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.

694
00:50:37,346 --> 00:50:41,746
This is a very impressive youth.
And a prince besides.

695
00:50:41,846 --> 00:50:45,196
If we're lucky, you won't have
to marry Jasmine after all.

696
00:50:45,296 --> 00:50:47,496
I don't trust him, sire.
- Nonsense.

697
00:50:47,596 --> 00:50:52,446
One thing I pride myself on.
I'm an excellent judge of character.

698
00:50:52,546 --> 00:50:54,196
An excellent judge, yeah, sure!

699
00:50:54,296 --> 00:50:56,146
Naah!

700
00:50:56,246 --> 00:50:58,541
Jasmine will like this one.

701
00:50:58,618 --> 00:51:00,896
And I'm sure I'll like Princess Jasmine.

702
00:51:00,996 --> 00:51:04,696
Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

703
00:51:04,796 --> 00:51:06,796
This boy is no different from the others.

704
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:09,496
What makes him think he is worthy
of the princess?

705
00:51:09,596 --> 00:51:12,741
Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa.

706
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,546
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

707
00:51:15,646 --> 00:51:18,396
How dare you? All of you.

708
00:51:18,496 --> 00:51:24,396
Standing around deciding my future?
I am not a prize to be won.

709
00:51:24,496 --> 00:51:26,846
Oh, dear.

710
00:51:26,946 --> 00:51:31,296
Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Just give Jasmine time to cool down.

711
00:51:31,396 --> 00:51:36,646
I think it's time
to say goodbye to Prince Abubu.

712
00:51:40,246 --> 00:51:44,096
What am I going to do?
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.

713
00:51:44,196 --> 00:51:49,551
I should have known I couldn't pull off
this stupid prince wish.

714
00:51:50,746 --> 00:51:52,846
So move.

715
00:51:56,346 --> 00:52:00,946
That's a good move.
I can't believe it. I'm losing to a rug.

716
00:52:01,046 --> 00:52:04,996
Genie, I need help.
- All right, sparky, here's the deal.

717
00:52:05,096 --> 00:52:09,346
If you want to court the lady, you got
to be a straight shooter. Do ya got it?

718
00:52:09,446 --> 00:52:10,296
What?

719
00:52:10,396 --> 00:52:13,146
Tell her the truth.

720
00:52:13,246 --> 00:52:19,796
No way. If Jasmine found out I was some
crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me.

721
00:52:19,896 --> 00:52:23,396
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

722
00:52:23,496 --> 00:52:27,696
Al, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.

723
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:29,896
That's the last thing I want to be.

724
00:52:29,996 --> 00:52:31,996
Ok, I'm going to go see her.

725
00:52:32,096 --> 00:52:37,096
I got to be smooth, cool, confident.

726
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:39,196
How do I look?

727
00:52:40,046 --> 00:52:42,246
Like a prince.

728
00:52:54,446 --> 00:52:56,746
Princess Jasmine?

729
00:52:57,646 --> 00:53:00,536
Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

730
00:53:01,446 --> 00:53:03,946
Prince Ali Ababwa.

731
00:53:04,046 --> 00:53:08,346
I do not want to see you.
- Please, Princess. Give me a chance.

732
00:53:08,446 --> 00:53:10,596
Leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

733
00:53:10,696 --> 00:53:13,331
So how's our little beau doing?

734
00:53:14,246 --> 00:53:16,696
Good kitty. Take off.

735
00:53:16,796 --> 00:53:19,296
Down, kitty.
- Wait.

736
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,446
Do I know you?

737
00:53:22,146 --> 00:53:24,146
No.

738
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:28,399
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.

739
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:30,697
The marketplace?

740
00:53:30,797 --> 00:53:33,597
I have servants who go
to the marketplace for me.

741
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:37,747
Why, I even have servants who
go to the marketplace for my servants.

742
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,897
So it couldn't have been me you met.

743
00:53:39,997 --> 00:53:41,997
No.

744
00:53:42,072 --> 00:53:46,067
I guess not.
- Enough about you. Talk about her.

745
00:53:46,147 --> 00:53:48,597
She's smart, fun. The hair, the eyes.

746
00:53:48,697 --> 00:53:50,897
Anything. Pick a feature.

747
00:53:50,997 --> 00:53:53,097
Princess Jasmine, you're very...

748
00:53:53,197 --> 00:53:55,497
Wonderful. Magnificent. Punctual.

749
00:53:55,597 --> 00:53:57,597
Punctual.
- Sorry.

750
00:53:57,697 --> 00:54:00,047
Beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

751
00:54:01,047 --> 00:54:04,397
I'm rich too, you know.
- Yeah.

752
00:54:04,497 --> 00:54:07,747
The daughter of a sultan.
- I know.

753
00:54:07,847 --> 00:54:11,847
A fine prize for any prince to marry.

754
00:54:11,947 --> 00:54:14,497
Right. A prince like me.

755
00:54:14,597 --> 00:54:18,447
Warning.
- Right. A prince like you.

756
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:22,297
And every other stuffed-shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.

757
00:54:22,397 --> 00:54:24,397
Mayday.

758
00:54:24,947 --> 00:54:27,547
Just go jump off a balcony.

759
00:54:28,047 --> 00:54:31,617
Stop her. Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.

760
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:35,497
OK, fine. But remember, bee yourself.

761
00:54:35,597 --> 00:54:37,597
Yeah, right.
- What?

762
00:54:38,347 --> 00:54:40,847
You are right!

763
00:54:41,447 --> 00:54:44,597
You aren't just some prize to be won.

764
00:54:44,697 --> 00:54:47,397
You should be free
to make your own choice.

765
00:54:47,497 --> 00:54:48,647
I'll go.

766
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:50,497
No.
- What?

767
00:54:50,597 --> 00:54:51,797
How...

768
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:55,297
How are you doing that?
- It's a magic carpet.

769
00:54:55,397 --> 00:54:57,797
It's lovely.

770
00:54:57,897 --> 00:54:59,697
You...

771
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,497
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?

772
00:55:02,597 --> 00:55:05,397
We could get out of the palace.
See the world.

773
00:55:05,497 --> 00:55:08,547
Ls it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?

774
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:12,147
What?
- Do you trust me?

775
00:55:14,047 --> 00:55:16,047
Yes.

776
00:55:30,447 --> 00:55:33,647
I can show you the world

777
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:37,947
Shining, shimmering, splendid

778
00:55:38,047 --> 00:55:44,447
Tell me, Princess, now when
did you last let your heart decide?

779
00:55:45,247 --> 00:55:49,247
I can open your eyes

780
00:55:49,347 --> 00:55:52,497
Take you wonder by wonder

781
00:55:52,597 --> 00:55:55,247
Over, sideways and under

782
00:55:55,347 --> 00:55:58,997
On a magic-carpet ride

783
00:55:59,097 --> 00:56:02,747
A whole new world

784
00:56:02,847 --> 00:56:06,397
A new fantastic point of view

785
00:56:06,497 --> 00:56:11,047
No one to tell us no or where to go

786
00:56:11,147 --> 00:56:13,647
Or say we're only dreaming

787
00:56:13,747 --> 00:56:17,347
A whole new world

788
00:56:17,447 --> 00:56:21,347
A dazzling place I never knew

789
00:56:21,447 --> 00:56:25,547
But when I'm way up here It's crystal clear

790
00:56:25,647 --> 00:56:29,847
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

791
00:56:29,947 --> 00:56:33,447
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

792
00:56:33,547 --> 00:56:37,047
Unbelievable sights

793
00:56:37,147 --> 00:56:40,597
Indescribable feeling

794
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:43,497
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling

795
00:56:43,597 --> 00:56:46,547
Through an endless diamond sky

796
00:56:46,647 --> 00:56:50,297
A whole new world
- Don't you dare close your eyes

797
00:56:50,397 --> 00:56:54,147
A hundred thousand things to see
- Hold your breath, it gets better

798
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:56,397
I'm like a shooting star

799
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:58,297
I've come so far

800
00:56:58,397 --> 00:57:02,947
I can't go back to where I used to be
- A whole new world

801
00:57:03,047 --> 00:57:06,747
Every turn a surprise
- With new horizons to pursue

802
00:57:06,847 --> 00:57:09,097
Every moment red-letter

803
00:57:09,197 --> 00:57:13,107
I'll chase them anywhere,
There's time to spare

804
00:57:13,192 --> 00:57:18,547
Let me share this
whole new world with you

805
00:57:19,547 --> 00:57:22,997
A whole new world

806
00:57:23,097 --> 00:57:27,347
That's where we'll be

807
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:31,097
A thrilling chase
- A wondrous place

808
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:35,947
For you and me

809
00:57:48,647 --> 00:57:51,747
It's all so magical.
- Yeah.

810
00:57:53,547 --> 00:57:56,197
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.

811
00:57:56,297 --> 00:58:01,057
He hates fireworks.
He doesn't really like flying either.

812
00:58:01,247 --> 00:58:03,247
That is...

813
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:06,247
Oh, no.
- You are the boy from the market.

814
00:58:06,347 --> 00:58:08,297
I knew it! Why did you lie to me?
- I'm sorry.

815
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:11,747
Did you think I was stupid?
That I wouldn't figure it out?

816
00:58:11,847 --> 00:58:14,597
No, I mean... I hoped you wouldn't.

817
00:58:14,697 --> 00:58:18,247
That's not what I meant.
- Who are you? Tell me the truth.

818
00:58:18,347 --> 00:58:20,347
The truth?

819
00:58:25,147 --> 00:58:29,447
The truth is, I sometimes
dress as a commoner.

820
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:32,862
To escape the pressures of palace life.

821
00:58:33,747 --> 00:58:36,547
But I really am a prince.

822
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:39,097
Why didn't you just tell me?

823
00:58:39,197 --> 00:58:41,547
Well, you know.

824
00:58:41,647 --> 00:58:47,247
Royalty going out into
the city in disguise.

825
00:58:48,547 --> 00:58:51,947
Sounds a little strange,
don't you think?

826
00:59:11,947 --> 00:59:14,597
Good night, my handsome prince.

827
00:59:14,697 --> 00:59:16,697
Sleep well, Princess.

828
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:41,247
Yes!

829
00:59:45,447 --> 00:59:50,717
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go right.

830
00:59:55,647 --> 00:59:57,647
Hold him.

831
01:00:01,447 --> 01:00:04,597
I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome,
Prince Abubu.

832
01:00:04,697 --> 01:00:09,202
Why you dirty, rotten...
- Make sure he's never found.

833
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:54,347
Never fails. Get in the bath and
there's a rub at the lamp. Hello?

834
01:00:54,447 --> 01:00:56,447
Al?

835
01:00:56,522 --> 01:00:59,297
Kid, snap out of it.

836
01:00:59,397 --> 01:01:01,747
I can't help you unless you make a wish.

837
01:01:01,847 --> 01:01:05,047
You have to say,
"Genie, I want you to save my life." OK?

838
01:01:05,147 --> 01:01:07,147
Come on, Aladdin.

839
01:01:08,047 --> 01:01:10,147
I'll take that as a yes.

840
01:01:10,947 --> 01:01:12,947
Up scope.

841
01:01:21,847 --> 01:01:24,147
Don't you scare me like that.

842
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,847
Genie, I...

843
01:01:30,147 --> 01:01:32,397
Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.

844
01:01:32,497 --> 01:01:34,897
I'm getting kind of fond of you, kid.

845
01:01:34,997 --> 01:01:38,142
Not that I want to pick out curtains.

846
01:01:45,148 --> 01:01:48,648
Oh, Father.
I just had the most wonderful time.

847
01:01:48,748 --> 01:01:52,298
I'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.

848
01:01:52,398 --> 01:01:55,398
I have chosen a husband for you.

849
01:01:55,498 --> 01:01:58,648
What?
- You will wed Jafar.

850
01:01:59,648 --> 01:02:02,948
You're speechless, I see.
A fine quality in a wife.

851
01:02:03,048 --> 01:02:04,848
I will never marry you.

852
01:02:04,948 --> 01:02:08,198
Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.

853
01:02:08,298 --> 01:02:10,698
Better check your crystal ball again.

854
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:13,648
Prince Ali.
- How in the...

855
01:02:15,048 --> 01:02:18,648
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.

856
01:02:18,748 --> 01:02:21,548
What ridiculous nonsense, Your Highness.

857
01:02:21,648 --> 01:02:23,948
He's obviously lying.

858
01:02:26,348 --> 01:02:30,768
Father, what's wrong with you?
- I know what's wrong.

859
01:02:31,548 --> 01:02:32,748
Oh, my.
- Your Highness.

860
01:02:32,848 --> 01:02:35,748
Jafar's been controlling you with this.

861
01:02:35,848 --> 01:02:38,498
What? Jafar?

862
01:02:38,598 --> 01:02:40,598
You low traitor.

863
01:02:40,698 --> 01:02:44,098
Your Majesty, all this can be explained.

864
01:02:44,173 --> 01:02:46,498
Guards.
- Well, that's it. We're dead.

865
01:02:46,598 --> 01:02:48,598
Just dig a grave for both of us.

866
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:51,898
Arrest Jafar at once.

867
01:02:51,998 --> 01:02:54,448
This is not done yet, boy.

868
01:02:58,048 --> 01:03:01,348
Find him. Search everywhere.

869
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:03,698
Jasmine, are you all right?
- Yes.

870
01:03:03,798 --> 01:03:08,348
Jafar, my most trusted counselor,
plotting against me all this time.

871
01:03:08,448 --> 01:03:12,698
This is horrible, just horrible.
How will I ever...

872
01:03:15,148 --> 01:03:20,348
Can this be true?
My daughter has finally chosen a suitor?

873
01:03:21,348 --> 01:03:23,448
Praise Allah.

874
01:03:24,448 --> 01:03:26,898
You brilliant boy.
I could kiss you.

875
01:03:26,998 --> 01:03:29,498
I won't. I'll leave that to my...

876
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:32,498
But you two will be wed at once.

877
01:03:32,598 --> 01:03:34,998
Yes, and you'll be happy and prosperous.

878
01:03:35,098 --> 01:03:38,498
And then you, my boy,
will become sultan.

879
01:03:38,573 --> 01:03:41,548
Sultan?
- Yes. A fine youth such as yourself.

880
01:03:41,648 --> 01:03:45,156
A person of your unimpeachable
moral character...

881
01:03:45,256 --> 01:03:47,748
is exactly what this kingdom needs.

882
01:03:47,848 --> 01:03:50,748
We got to get out of here.
I got to start packing.

883
01:03:50,848 --> 01:03:54,398
Only essentials. We gotta travel light.
Bring the guns, the knives...

884
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:58,748
And how about this picture?
I don't know.

885
01:04:00,948 --> 01:04:02,498
Oh, boy.

886
01:04:02,598 --> 01:04:05,063
He's cracked. He's gone nuts.

887
01:04:06,848 --> 01:04:08,848
Get a grip!

888
01:04:09,348 --> 01:04:10,548
Good grip.

889
01:04:10,648 --> 01:04:14,048
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that urchin Aladdin.

890
01:04:14,148 --> 01:04:15,948
He has the lamp, Iago.

891
01:04:16,048 --> 01:04:19,798
Why, that miserable...
- But you will relieve him of it.

892
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:21,898
Me?

893
01:04:24,548 --> 01:04:26,548
Sultan?

894
01:04:26,636 --> 01:04:28,846
They want me to be sultan?

895
01:04:30,648 --> 01:04:33,448
Hail the conquering hero

896
01:04:40,748 --> 01:04:43,598
You've just won the heart of the princess.

897
01:04:43,698 --> 01:04:46,248
What are you going to do next?

898
01:04:51,748 --> 01:04:56,348
Your line is,
"I'm going to free the genie."

899
01:04:56,448 --> 01:04:58,598
Any time.
- Genie...

900
01:04:58,698 --> 01:05:00,498
I can't.
- Sure you can.

901
01:05:00,598 --> 01:05:03,998
You just go, "Genie, I wish you free."

902
01:05:04,098 --> 01:05:05,498
I'm serious.

903
01:05:05,598 --> 01:05:07,648
Look, I'm sorry, I really am.

904
01:05:07,748 --> 01:05:12,148
But they want to make me sultan.
No, they want to make Prince Ali sultan.

905
01:05:12,248 --> 01:05:14,948
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

906
01:05:15,048 --> 01:05:16,898
Al, you won.
- Because of you.

907
01:05:16,998 --> 01:05:20,498
People only think I'm worth anything
because of you.

908
01:05:20,598 --> 01:05:24,548
What if they find out I'm not a prince?
What if Jasmine finds out?

909
01:05:24,648 --> 01:05:27,198
I'd lose her.

910
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,598
I can't keep this up on my own.

911
01:05:29,698 --> 01:05:32,348
I can't wish you free.

912
01:05:33,248 --> 01:05:36,898
I understand.
After all, you've lied to everyone else.

913
01:05:36,998 --> 01:05:38,798
I was beginning to feel left out.

914
01:05:38,898 --> 01:05:42,448
Now, if you'll excuse me, master.

915
01:05:45,948 --> 01:05:47,988
Genie, I'm really sorry.

916
01:05:49,048 --> 01:05:52,748
Well, fine. Then just stay in there.

917
01:05:54,248 --> 01:05:56,713
What are you guys looking at?

918
01:05:59,248 --> 01:06:01,248
Look, I...

919
01:06:01,348 --> 01:06:03,498
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't...

920
01:06:03,598 --> 01:06:05,648
Wait. Come on.

921
01:06:10,848 --> 01:06:12,848
What am I doing?

922
01:06:14,548 --> 01:06:16,998
Genie's right.

923
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,298
I got to tell Jasmine the truth.

924
01:06:19,398 --> 01:06:22,648
Ali, will you come here?

925
01:06:24,248 --> 01:06:25,798
Here goes.

926
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:28,148
Jasmine, where are you?

927
01:06:28,748 --> 01:06:32,233
Out in the menagerie. Hurry.
- I'm coming.

928
01:06:36,048 --> 01:06:38,898
You got a problem, pinky?

929
01:06:38,998 --> 01:06:40,998
Jerk.

930
01:06:43,248 --> 01:06:45,498
Jafar's going to be happy to see you.

931
01:06:45,598 --> 01:06:48,403
Excellent work, Iago.
- Ah, go on.

932
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:52,098
No, really. On a scale of one to ten,
you are an eleven.

933
01:06:52,198 --> 01:06:54,493
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.

934
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:56,798
I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing.

935
01:06:56,898 --> 01:06:59,898
People of Agrabah,

936
01:06:59,998 --> 01:07:04,698
my daughter has finally chosen a suitor.

937
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:07,048
He is a man of integrity.
- Jasmine?

938
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,048
Ali, where you have you been?

939
01:07:09,148 --> 01:07:11,098
There's something I gotta tell you.

940
01:07:11,198 --> 01:07:14,848
The whole kingdom has turned out
for Father's announcement.

941
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,598
Jasmine, listen to me.
Please, you don't understand.

942
01:07:17,698 --> 01:07:20,748
Good luck.
- Prince Ali Ababwa.

943
01:07:25,448 --> 01:07:29,648
Look at them.
Cheering that little pipsqueak.

944
01:07:29,748 --> 01:07:32,148
Let them cheer.

945
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:35,298
You know, Al, I'm getting really...

946
01:07:35,398 --> 01:07:37,298
I don't think you're him.

947
01:07:37,398 --> 01:07:41,548
Tonight the part of Al will be played
by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man.

948
01:07:41,648 --> 01:07:44,298
I am your master now.
- I was afraid of that.

949
01:07:44,398 --> 01:07:47,448
Genie, grant me my first wish.

950
01:07:47,548 --> 01:07:51,148
I wish to rule on high. As sultan.

951
01:07:56,148 --> 01:07:58,248
Bless my soul.

952
01:07:59,348 --> 01:08:01,498
What is this? What's going on?

953
01:08:01,598 --> 01:08:05,168
Oh, my goodness. What's happened?
- Father!

954
01:08:07,048 --> 01:08:10,148
Jafar, you vile betrayer.

955
01:08:10,248 --> 01:08:13,048
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.

956
01:08:13,148 --> 01:08:16,208
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.

957
01:08:16,548 --> 01:08:21,348
The lamp.
- Finders keepers, Abubu.

958
01:08:35,948 --> 01:08:37,498
Genie, no!

959
01:08:37,598 --> 01:08:40,648
Sorry, kid. I got a new master now.

960
01:08:41,648 --> 01:08:44,098
Jafar, I order you to stop.

961
01:08:44,198 --> 01:08:47,748
But there's a new order now. My order.

962
01:08:47,848 --> 01:08:51,048
Finally you will bow to me.

963
01:08:51,148 --> 01:08:52,948
We will never bow to you.

964
01:08:53,048 --> 01:08:55,048
Why am I not surprised?

965
01:08:55,136 --> 01:08:57,398
If you won't bow before a sultan,

966
01:08:57,498 --> 01:09:00,598
then you will cower before a sorcerer.

967
01:09:00,698 --> 01:09:02,898
Genie, my second wish.

968
01:09:02,998 --> 01:09:07,418
I wish to be the most powerful
sorcerer in the world.

969
01:09:08,848 --> 01:09:11,098
Genie, stop.

970
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:13,698
Ladies and gentlemen,

971
01:09:13,798 --> 01:09:18,648
a warm Agrabah welcome
for sorcerer Jafar.

972
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:21,448
Now, where were we?

973
01:09:21,536 --> 01:09:25,448
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.

974
01:09:27,248 --> 01:09:29,348
Down, boy.

975
01:09:31,048 --> 01:09:34,948
Oh, Princess. There's someone
I'm dying to introduce you to.

976
01:09:35,048 --> 01:09:36,748
Get your hands off her.

977
01:09:36,848 --> 01:09:40,948
Prince Ali, yes it is he
But not as you know him

978
01:09:41,048 --> 01:09:45,548
Read my lips and come to grips with reality

979
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:47,998
Yes, meet a blast from your past

980
01:09:48,098 --> 01:09:50,499
Whose lies were too good to last

981
01:09:50,599 --> 01:09:53,949
Say hello to your precious Prince Ali

982
01:09:54,049 --> 01:09:56,549
Or should we say Aladdin?

983
01:09:58,549 --> 01:10:00,599
I tried to tell you. I'm just...

984
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:04,949
So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin

985
01:10:05,049 --> 01:10:09,399
Just a con, need I go on?
Take it from me

986
01:10:09,499 --> 01:10:13,749
His personality flaws
Give me adequate cause

987
01:10:13,849 --> 01:10:15,599
To send him packing on a one-way trip

988
01:10:15,699 --> 01:10:17,799
So his prospects take a terminal dip

989
01:10:17,899 --> 01:10:20,199
His assets frozen, the venue chosen

990
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:23,599
ls the ends of the earth, whoopee!

991
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:26,249
So long
- Goodbye. See ya.

992
01:10:26,349 --> 01:10:31,349
Ex-Prince Ali

993
01:11:03,749 --> 01:11:05,849
This is all my fault.

994
01:11:05,949 --> 01:11:10,284
I should have freed the genie
when I had the chance.

995
01:11:10,549 --> 01:11:12,649
Are you OK?

996
01:11:13,249 --> 01:11:15,299
I'm sorry, Abu.

997
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:19,199
I made a mess of everything. Somehow.

998
01:11:19,299 --> 01:11:22,359
Got to go back and set things right.

999
01:11:28,949 --> 01:11:30,949
Carpet!

1000
01:11:34,549 --> 01:11:36,549
Abu, start digging.

1001
01:11:38,749 --> 01:11:40,849
That's it.

1002
01:11:57,049 --> 01:11:59,549
Yeah! All right.

1003
01:12:05,249 --> 01:12:07,884
Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.

1004
01:12:10,349 --> 01:12:13,849
Puppet ruler want a cracker?
Here. Here's your cracker.

1005
01:12:13,949 --> 01:12:17,199
Shove 'em down your throat.
Here, have lots of crackers.

1006
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:20,349
Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone.

1007
01:12:22,749 --> 01:12:26,744
Lt pains me to see you
reduced to this, Jasmine.

1008
01:12:28,449 --> 01:12:30,899
A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself

1009
01:12:30,999 --> 01:12:34,699
should be on the arm
of the most powerful man in the world.

1010
01:12:34,799 --> 01:12:36,499
What do you say, my dear?

1011
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:39,299
Why, with you as my queen...

1012
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:41,399
Never!

1013
01:12:41,849 --> 01:12:45,249
I'll teach you some respect.

1014
01:12:46,549 --> 01:12:48,749
No. Genie.

1015
01:12:49,749 --> 01:12:52,099
I have decided to make my final wish.

1016
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:58,349
I wish for Princess Jasmine
to fall desperately in love with me.

1017
01:13:03,549 --> 01:13:07,099
Master, there are a few addendas,
some quid pro quos.

1018
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:09,399
Don't talk back, you big blue lout.

1019
01:13:09,499 --> 01:13:14,549
You will do what I order you to do, slave.

1020
01:13:17,649 --> 01:13:23,149
I never realized
how incredibly handsome you are.

1021
01:13:25,749 --> 01:13:27,849
That's better.

1022
01:13:28,249 --> 01:13:30,899
Now, pussycat,

1023
01:13:30,999 --> 01:13:33,849
tell me more about myself.

1024
01:13:33,949 --> 01:13:38,249
You're tall, dark.

1025
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:41,099
Well-dressed.

1026
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,399
Al. Little buddy.

1027
01:13:43,499 --> 01:13:45,949
I love...

1028
01:13:47,849 --> 01:13:51,649
Al, I can't help you.
I work for senior psychopath now.

1029
01:13:51,749 --> 01:13:54,949
What are you going to do?
- I'm a street rat, remember?

1030
01:13:55,049 --> 01:13:59,849
I'll improvise.
- Cute little gaps between your teeth.

1031
01:13:59,949 --> 01:14:01,699
Go on.

1032
01:14:01,799 --> 01:14:06,449
And your beard is so...

1033
01:14:06,549 --> 01:14:08,549
twisted.

1034
01:14:08,637 --> 01:14:11,349
You've stolen my heart.

1035
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:16,149
And the street rat?

1036
01:14:16,249 --> 01:14:18,849
What street rat?

1037
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:31,549
That was...

1038
01:14:33,749 --> 01:14:35,749
You!

1039
01:14:35,849 --> 01:14:39,849
How many times do I have to kill you, boy?

1040
01:14:42,749 --> 01:14:45,399
Get the lamp.

1041
01:14:45,499 --> 01:14:46,999
No.

1042
01:14:47,099 --> 01:14:49,749
Princess, your time is up.

1043
01:14:55,849 --> 01:14:57,949
Nice shot, Jafar.

1044
01:14:59,449 --> 01:15:01,549
Don't toy with me.

1045
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:07,449
Things are unraveling fast now, boy.

1046
01:15:10,249 --> 01:15:12,249
Get the point?

1047
01:15:17,649 --> 01:15:20,249
I'm just getting warmed up.

1048
01:15:22,449 --> 01:15:26,149
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

1049
01:15:26,249 --> 01:15:28,499
A snake, am I?

1050
01:15:28,599 --> 01:15:33,749
Perhaps you'd like to see
how snakelike I can be.

1051
01:15:49,849 --> 01:15:51,949
Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake!
Stick that sword into that snake!

1052
01:15:52,049 --> 01:15:53,649
You should stay out of this.

1053
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:56,349
Jafar, Jafar. He's our man.
If he can't do it...

1054
01:15:56,449 --> 01:15:58,449
Great!

1055
01:16:12,549 --> 01:16:14,649
Jasmine, hang on!

1056
01:16:16,749 --> 01:16:19,949
You little fool.

1057
01:16:20,049 --> 01:16:25,249
You thought you could defeat
the most powerful being on Earth.

1058
01:16:25,349 --> 01:16:28,399
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a...

1059
01:16:28,499 --> 01:16:32,449
Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.

1060
01:16:32,549 --> 01:16:35,049
The genie.

1061
01:16:35,949 --> 01:16:38,299
The genie has more power
than you'll ever have.

1062
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:40,299
What?
- He gave you your power.

1063
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:44,399
He can take it away.
- Al, why are you bringing me into this?

1064
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:48,324
Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second-best.

1065
01:16:49,149 --> 01:16:53,949
You're right.
His power does exceed my own.

1066
01:16:54,049 --> 01:16:56,149
But not for long.

1067
01:16:56,249 --> 01:16:59,199
The boy's crazy.
He's a little punch-drunk.

1068
01:16:59,299 --> 01:17:03,749
One too many hits with the snake.
- Slave, I make my third wish.

1069
01:17:03,849 --> 01:17:08,049
I wish to be an all-powerful genie.

1070
01:17:11,449 --> 01:17:13,899
All right. Your wish is my command.

1071
01:17:13,999 --> 01:17:16,149
Way to go, Al.

1072
01:17:20,349 --> 01:17:22,449
Yes.

1073
01:17:25,149 --> 01:17:27,649
The power.

1074
01:17:29,449 --> 01:17:33,249
The absolute power.

1075
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:36,899
What have you done?
- Trust me.

1076
01:17:37,549 --> 01:17:42,749
The universe is mine to command.
To control.

1077
01:17:42,849 --> 01:17:46,349
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?

1078
01:17:46,449 --> 01:17:48,899
You wanted to be a genie? You got it.

1079
01:17:48,999 --> 01:17:52,499
What?
- And everything that goes with it.

1080
01:17:52,599 --> 01:17:55,049
No.

1081
01:17:55,149 --> 01:17:59,485
I'm getting out of here.
- Phenomenal cosmic powers.

1082
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:02,500
Itty-bitty living space.

1083
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,550
Al, you little genius, you.

1084
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:21,900
Get your blasted beak out of my face.

1085
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,500
Shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

1086
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:31,720
Allow me. Ten thousand years in a cave
of wonders ought to chill him out.

1087
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:34,550
Shut up.

1088
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:45,400
I'm sorry I lied to you
about being a prince.

1089
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,550
I know why you did.

1090
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:53,700
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

1091
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,750
That stupid law. This isn't fair.

1092
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:58,850
I love you.

1093
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:03,100
Al, no problem.
You still got one wish left.

1094
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,500
Say the word and you're a prince again.

1095
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,500
But what about your freedom?

1096
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,550
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.

1097
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:12,500
This is love.

1098
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,800
Al, you're not going to find another
girl like her in a million years.

1099
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:19,620
Believe me, I know. I've looked.

1100
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:23,100
Jasmine, I do love you.

1101
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,300
But I got to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

1102
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,450
I understand.

1103
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:34,900
Genie, I wish for your freedom.
- One prince pedigree coming up.

1104
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,150
What?
- Genie, you're free.

1105
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:00,800
I'm free.

1106
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:06,050
Quick, wish for something outrageous.
Say, "I want the Nile." Try that.

1107
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:08,615
I wish for the Nile.
- No way.

1108
01:20:09,650 --> 01:20:12,200
Oh, does that feel good!

1109
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:15,400
I'm free. I'm free at last.

1110
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:19,410
I'm hitting the road.
I'm off to see the world.

1111
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:31,100
I'm going to miss you.

1112
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,250
Me too, Al.

1113
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:37,450
No matter what anybody says,

1114
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:40,270
you'll always be a prince to me.

1115
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:46,050
That's right. You've certainly proven
your worth as far as I'm concerned.

1116
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:48,700
It's that law that's the problem.

1117
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,950
Father?
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?

1118
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:58,200
From this day forth, the princess
shall marry whoever she deems worthy.

1119
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:00,650
Him. I choose...

1120
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:05,050
I choose you, Aladdin.

1121
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:08,050
Call me Al.

1122
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:13,250
All of you, come over here.
Big group hug.

1123
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:17,150
Do you mind if I kiss the monkey?
Hairball.

1124
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:22,250
Well, I can't do any more damage around
this Popsicle stand. I'm out of here.

1125
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:24,600
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds.

1126
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:27,400
Hey, Rugman, ciao, I'm history.

1127
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,100
No, I'm mythology.

1128
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,005
I don't care what I am. I'm free.

1129
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:37,200
A whole new world

1130
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:39,800
A whole new life

1131
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:44,350
For you and me

1132
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:03,550
Made you look.

1133
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:13,550
