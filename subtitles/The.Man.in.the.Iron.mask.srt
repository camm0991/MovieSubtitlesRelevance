1
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:34,494
Some of this is legend, but
at least this much is fact.

2
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:39,166
When rioting citizens of
France destroyed the Bastille...

3
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:44,010
they discovered within its
records this mysterious entry:

4
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:48,541
Prisoner number
6-4-3-8-9000.

5
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:52,180
The man in the iron mask.''

6
00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:27,156
You dead yet?

7
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:37,044
Aramis!

8
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:44,019
Porthos is-

9
00:02:45,694 --> 00:02:48,993
l'm sorry, my dears. You
would have enjoyed it too.

10
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:52,932
- He's hung like a donkey.
- So are you.

11
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,593
- Really?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:57,900
lt has been asleep so long,
l've forgotten about it.

13
00:02:57,973 --> 00:03:01,966
Okay, go on now. Leave
His Holiness alone.

14
00:03:02,043 --> 00:03:06,207
l'll bring you back tomorrow
when he's in a better mood.

15
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:08,875
Go on, ladies.

16
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:18,022
Stop praying and revel with me, Aramis.

17
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:21,893
l need my spirits
lifted. l'm old. l'm weak.

18
00:03:21,963 --> 00:03:24,523
- My strength is gone.
- Porthos.

19
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:28,165
- l'm praying.
- l just said you're praying.

20
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:31,637
Are you deaf too? l know
you're blind because...

21
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:34,607
if you'd seen the tits that
just walked out of here...

22
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:36,371
you'd have tears in your eyes.

23
00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:39,675
Sometimes there are more important
things to life than a good pair of tits.

24
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:41,841
Really?

25
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:44,215
Hey, Aramis...

26
00:03:44,286 --> 00:03:48,086
if you can name me one
thing, one single thing...

27
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:50,920
that is more sublime than the feel...

28
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:54,826
of a plump, pink nipple
between my lips...

29
00:03:54,896 --> 00:03:56,989
l'll build you a new cathedral.

30
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:00,398
Forgiveness.

31
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:02,060
Forgiveness?

32
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,939
Forgive me.

33
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:15,082
Am l forgiven?

34
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:27,160
l observe your forgiveness isn't
sweeter than a plump nipple.

35
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:31,722
Don't you understand?
l'm trying to pray!

36
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,291
You're always praying!

37
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,867
D'Artagnan!

38
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:44,807
Oh! D'Artagnan!

39
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,642
- How are you, young pup?
- Porthos.

40
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:49,081
You interrupted a simple
theological discussion.

41
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,084
- So l see.
- Welcome. Sit.

42
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:54,246
l wish that l could.

43
00:04:54,322 --> 00:04:56,950
l come upon the king's
business. He wishes to see you.

44
00:04:57,025 --> 00:04:59,585
Still you serve him loyally,
even though the people...

45
00:04:59,661 --> 00:05:01,925
throw rotten eggs at his royal emblem.

46
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:07,166
Look at you. You look so young.

47
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:09,226
And l feel so old.

48
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,403
King says immediately.

49
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,909
One for all, D'Artagnan.

50
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:25,718
And all for one.

51
00:05:29,157 --> 00:05:32,092
We were all Musketeers once, eh?

52
00:05:36,464 --> 00:05:39,558
l wonder how Athos is doing.

53
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:43,798
Relax, Raoul. After all, you're my son.

54
00:05:43,872 --> 00:05:46,568
How could any woman resist you?

55
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:48,370
When will you ask her?

56
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:53,710
Today, as we arrive, or
perhaps when we are leaving.

57
00:05:53,782 --> 00:05:55,943
When l think about
it, l get so confused.

58
00:05:56,017 --> 00:05:58,451
Will this help?

59
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,224
Mother's ring.

60
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:06,226
l can't take this. lt's yours.

61
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:08,455
She died giving you
to me. l want to die...

62
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,159
knowing it's on the finger
of the woman my son loves.

63
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:15,202
Go. Bring back your fiance.

64
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:50,460
Your Majesty, the
attack will come at dawn.

65
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:53,507
No, no. Do not underestimate the Dutch.

66
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,306
These troops will be cut off
here, so shift them here and here.

67
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:04,783
And then we outnumber them
there. Yes, send that on its way.

68
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:07,083
- Your Majesty-
- The yellow sash.

69
00:07:07,155 --> 00:07:09,248
As your advisors,
we feel it is our-

70
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:13,584
- Our duty.
- Yes, our duty...

71
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:16,653
to inform you that
there are riots in Paris.

72
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:19,662
Riots?

73
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:22,635
But Paris is the most
beautiful city in the world.

74
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:26,470
Why should my people feel
anything but pride and contentment?

75
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:30,568
Well, of course, Your Majesty. l'm
sure they are content and proud.

76
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:32,579
But they are also starving.

77
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:35,574
Your Majesty, if we
distributed some of the food...

78
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,618
that has been reserved for the army...

79
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:40,848
there would be plenty
of time to gather more-

80
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,925
Father Aramis...

81
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:57,369
His Majesty is experiencing
some difficulty with the Jesuits.

82
00:07:57,438 --> 00:07:59,372
- The Jesuits?
- They have declared that...

83
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,433
His Majesty's wars are unjust
and the source of public hunger.

84
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:05,877
Then perhaps His Majesty
should speak to their leader.

85
00:08:05,947 --> 00:08:07,881
Yes, but who is he?

86
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:10,213
No one can keep secrets
like the Jesuits can.

87
00:08:11,986 --> 00:08:14,427
Your Majesty.

88
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,299
You are a priest, but
once you were a Musketeer.

89
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:28,034
l, like my father before
me, have trusted you...

90
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,133
with the gravest of missions.

91
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,409
l want you to find out who the
secret leader of the Jesuits is.

92
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,578
And when you have...

93
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:44,487
for God and for France,
l wish you to kill him.

94
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,491
l know this is a terrible thing l
ask, especially from a priest, but-

95
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:59,567
Can you accept this
mission and keep it private?

96
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,537
When l discover the identity
of this Jesuit rebel...

97
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,848
l will kill both him
and the man who told me.

98
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:17,314
Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer.

99
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,258
Now, about these riots.

100
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,762
We have stocks on the
wharves right now, don't we?

101
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,765
We can distribute that.

102
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,824
But, Majesty, that food is spoiling.

103
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,700
That is why it was not sent to the army.

104
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,103
Then you must hurry.

105
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:37,109
What an excellent idea, Your Majesty.

106
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,805
Look at the stitching on that one.

107
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,313
Don't they look glorious?

108
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,316
Not so glorious as you.

109
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,750
Who is that?

110
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,951
Raoul, the son of Athos.

111
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,520
Francois, your taste may
run to young soldiers...

112
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,795
but l was referring to
the beauty next to him.

113
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,370
Her name is Christine.

114
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,948
Majesty.

115
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,485
What is it now? Assassins
falling from the skies?

116
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,354
The pig chase plans were kept from me.

117
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,758
D'Artagnan, look at
the faces of these men.

118
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,629
They admire and fear you. With the
great D'Artagnan watching over me...

119
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,896
who in France would be possibly
such a fool as to try and do me harm?

120
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,802
A fool's blade can be
sharper than his brain.

121
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,067
Let us play a game.

122
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,609
Let us pretend as if
l am king and you are...

123
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,702
the captain of my Musketeers.

124
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,713
Let us behave as if my wish is law...

125
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,046
and my wish is to enjoy this party...

126
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,712
as should you.

127
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,519
Ladies.

128
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,960
Christine, ever since l arrived-

129
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,971
- Monsieur? Mademoiselle?
- No, thank you.

130
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,371
Captain, may l present
Christine Bellefort.

131
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,577
D'Artagnan is my father's best friend.

132
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,710
l am honored that you
have granted my request...

133
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:03,688
for a commission in the Musketeers,
that l may follow my father and you.

134
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,451
The honor is mine.

135
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,425
One for all.

136
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,586
And all for one.

137
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,697
l love you.

138
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,699
And l love you.

139
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:24,231
l'll never be a rich man, but
you'll always have my heart.

140
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,642
Then l am richer than the king.

141
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:35,186
Then l have something to give you
that once belonged to my mother.

142
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:40,185
We offer a contest of
cunning and agility.

143
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,625
Behold our unicorn.

144
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,356
Whoever captures our unicorn...

145
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,560
shall win its treasure.

146
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:57,472
Now, to the chase. l command you all!

147
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,175
The pendant will be yours.

148
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,209
Christine, isn't it? l would've
thought it was impossible...

149
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:16,517
but l do believe the excitement of this
chase has made you even more beautiful.

150
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,251
Sire, l thank you.

151
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:23,261
You blush. You do not wish to
look beautiful for your king?

152
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,263
No, sire.

153
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,095
l mean, yes, yes. Of course, sire.

154
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,328
- l mean that, you are-
- lt's all right.

155
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,099
l understand that you're not
accustomed to these surroundings.

156
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,936
But that is a condition
we can happily remedy.

157
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,212
One such as you would fit
nicely as a lady-in-waiting.

158
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:51,380
His Majesty is very, very kind...

159
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,425
but l'm engaged to Raoul...

160
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,961
or will be when he manages to ask me.

161
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,258
You would choose a soldier-

162
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:02,097
a soldier who has not yet
proposed, above a king?

163
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,301
l could only be faithful to my heart.

164
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,636
But how faithful is that heart to you?

165
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,922
Wait, Christine.

166
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,544
Feed your people.

167
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,725
Jesuits.

168
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,512
Get me a general.

169
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,842
Her Majesty wishes a word with you.

170
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,990
Your Majesty.

171
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,617
l understand you saved
my son's life today.

172
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,389
God smiled upon us, Your Majesty.

173
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,728
And you are not hurt?

174
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,928
- No, my lady.
- That is good.

175
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,614
Captain.

176
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:43,917
Raoul, son of Athos, had withdrawn
his request to join the Musketeers.

177
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,031
- You have improved.
- lt's been so long.

178
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,042
So it has, my friend.

179
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,476
- What's the occasion?
- As you say, it's been too long.

180
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:14,110
When the great D'Artagnan visits,
he must be offered the best wine.

181
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:18,282
And if the great Athos offers,
the great D'Artagnan must drink.

182
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,960
l'm sorry l haven't been to
see you lately, my friend.

183
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,590
Head of the king's bodyguards?
That must keep you busy.

184
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,793
Especially with this king.

185
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:33,566
Still, l should have come
to see you more often.

186
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:37,439
l belong to the past, when the uniforms
were black and grown men wore them.

187
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,037
At least it gives you more
time to practice your violin.

188
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:44,082
And feel sorry for myself.

189
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,447
My son is grown. He's
proposed to a wonderful girl.

190
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,546
He's joined the Musketeers. All the
errors of my life are made right in him.

191
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:54,855
And now, for the life l've always
wished him, he's leaving my home.

192
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:02,257
Out celebrating all night.

193
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,393
Look who's come to visit.

194
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,006
What's the matter?

195
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,746
l cannot risk making her a widow
just as l ask to make her a wife.

196
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,815
l've been recalled to my regiment.

197
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,443
But that makes no sense.

198
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,953
You've already served at the front.

199
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,923
Has there been some disaster?

200
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,029
Has everyone else been recalled?

201
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:36,028
l believe that the king's
eye has fallen on Christine.

202
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:40,037
lt's true the king has noticed her, but
l don't think it has anything to do-

203
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,131
lt has everything to do
with it. The king is a dog.

204
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,870
- Athos.
- A dog and a coward.

205
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,913
But l am neither, and so l go.

206
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,085
Does the king have
trouble finding women?

207
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:56,451
Does he have trouble filling his bed?

208
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,513
l served his father.

209
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,856
Until l retired, l served him.

210
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,590
And now, to seduce a woman
who will mean nothing to him...

211
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:09,623
once he has had her, he would
put my son's life in danger?

212
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,232
You knew this was happening.

213
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,704
You knew, and that's why you came!

214
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,401
- l knew your temper.
- You came to restrain me?

215
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,841
To bring you hope.

216
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,745
l will speak to the king personally.

217
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,517
l have not yet lost faith that he may
become the king we all wish him to be.

218
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,423
You don't know what it's
like to have a son...

219
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,518
to have kissed his hair
and smelled his breath...

220
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,462
as he slept, to have watched him grow.

221
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,999
Yes. Fatherhood is a blessing...

222
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,305
l can only imagine.

223
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,602
l have never known a finer man than
you, nor cared more for a friend.

224
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,116
But if this king harms my
son merely to take a lover...

225
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,981
then this king will become my enemy.

226
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,545
And so will any man that stands
between that enemy and me.

227
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,989
Then l must hurry...

228
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,187
for l treasure your son...

229
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,457
as l treasure you.

230
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,106
Guard the gate. Captain.

231
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,340
The people are saying the food the
king ordered us to distribute is rotten.

232
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,110
They're attacking
Musketeers all over the city.

233
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:34,685
Get the gate!

234
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:55,263
- We'll fire a volley into them.
- No. Close the gates. Do not fire.

235
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,012
lt's D'Artagnan.

236
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:18,889
Citizens of Paris, listen to me.

237
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:22,092
- l am one of you.
- We're starving!

238
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,499
They give us garbage
not even fit for rats!

239
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,738
Listen to me.

240
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,235
Listen to me, l beg you!

241
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,170
You're right. lt is rotten.

242
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,369
l will speak to the king myself.

243
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,344
You have my word on it.

244
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:17,374
And you will release those men,
for they serve France and you.

245
00:24:57,481 --> 00:25:00,644
Oh, Louis, you were right.

246
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,652
A woman has never known love...

247
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:06,815
until she has known the love of a king.

248
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,192
l'm hungry.

249
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:17,967
l'll have some food brought.

250
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:21,537
l like to eat alone.

251
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:26,267
By the way, you'll be leaving tomorrow.

252
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:50,228
These passageways were made
for the king's security...

253
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,291
not so you can startle me to death.

254
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:54,837
lt is for your security
that l've come, Your Majesty.

255
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:56,736
l already know about the rioting.

256
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:59,469
Your people are most
anxious to love you...

257
00:25:59,543 --> 00:26:01,977
but they are eating rotten
food, and sometimes none at all.

258
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:03,979
Rotten food?

259
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,245
Well, l'll deal with that decisively.

260
00:26:11,054 --> 00:26:14,922
There is another matter
of a more personal nature.

261
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:21,120
You are constantly
surrounded by beautiful women.

262
00:26:21,198 --> 00:26:24,292
- Do you love any of them?
- Quite frequently, actually.

263
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:28,034
And they love you?
How do you know that...

264
00:26:28,105 --> 00:26:30,471
when a woman gives you her
most intimate embrace...

265
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:33,806
that it is you and not your
crown that she pulls to her heart?

266
00:26:33,877 --> 00:26:36,038
You think my affairs are empty.

267
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:39,549
l think that it is
possible for one man...

268
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:43,746
to love one woman all his life
and be the better for it, yes.

269
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:45,755
You may be right.

270
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:52,560
Perhaps l haven't met a woman with
a heart like my own until recently.

271
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:57,199
Would that be Christine?

272
00:26:57,267 --> 00:27:01,465
lt is good that you watch me, but
l fear you watch me too closely.

273
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:05,872
Did you send Raoul to the war so
that you could be free to pursue her?

274
00:27:05,943 --> 00:27:09,106
- Do you question my honor?
- No, l do not question your honor.

275
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:12,944
lt's you l care about.

276
00:27:14,318 --> 00:27:17,014
Raoul will return soon.

277
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:19,021
You have my word.

278
00:27:20,023 --> 00:27:21,957
Thank you, Your Majesty.

279
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:34,103
l am a young king...

280
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:37,139
but l am king.

281
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:40,699
Then be a good king, Your Majesty.

282
00:27:51,555 --> 00:27:55,355
You're the new chief advisor. Execute
him for distributing rotten food.

283
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:02,356
And the next time there
are rioters, shoot them.

284
00:28:11,642 --> 00:28:13,576
Over there.

285
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,637
Wait.

286
00:28:17,714 --> 00:28:21,309
Please take this to
the royal dispatchers.

287
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:52,010
l'll get you some water
in a moment, Mother.

288
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,960
His Majesty regrets to inform
you that Raoul, son of Athos...

289
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,964
has been killed in action.

290
00:30:06,023 --> 00:30:08,423
Sir, a casualty report came.

291
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:13,963
Does Athos know of this?

292
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,674
Athos, my friend.

293
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:28,302
Stop there, you traitor!

294
00:30:38,188 --> 00:30:40,986
Listen to me!

295
00:30:41,058 --> 00:30:43,492
The cannons killed Raoul.

296
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,018
Do not add your own
death to this tragedy.

297
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,031
l beg you.

298
00:30:56,306 --> 00:30:57,398
Get back.

299
00:31:18,195 --> 00:31:20,356
You're the traitor.

300
00:31:28,572 --> 00:31:30,506
See to the wounded.

301
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,983
Does your new apartment suit you?

302
00:31:52,295 --> 00:31:56,197
Sire, when you sent for me
after the news of Raoul...

303
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:58,200
l just came to ask for your help.

304
00:31:58,902 --> 00:32:01,097
l have no way to feed my family.

305
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:04,538
- My father is dead and my mother has-
- A sickness of the lungs.

306
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:08,305
And your sister has early
signs of the condition.

307
00:32:08,378 --> 00:32:11,211
But my physician has seen
them both and is optimistic.

308
00:32:11,281 --> 00:32:14,444
They will recover well
at my country estate.

309
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,213
Oh, Your Majesty.

310
00:32:16,286 --> 00:32:18,777
l know this day for you...

311
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:21,551
the Earth has spun round more than once.

312
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:24,355
And you must still feel it spinning.

313
00:32:25,428 --> 00:32:29,364
Let us sit at a quiet dinner and see
if we may not bring it to a pause.

314
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,289
Listen to me.

315
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,288
You've lost someone
dear to your heart...

316
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:52,200
and l have no desire for you to sit
here trying to turn that heart to stone.

317
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:57,203
l only ask you this:

318
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,800
that whatever you feel tonight...

319
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,937
you allow yourself to
share it openly with me.

320
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,499
To good health.

321
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,667
You are so beautiful.

322
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,447
l cannot do this.

323
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:43,976
l hope you know that there is
more of me to love than a crown.

324
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,635
Of all the wonders l have seen...

325
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:18,641
l have never looked upon
anything as beautiful as you.

326
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:35,556
Aramis, is this the way to hell?

327
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:39,185
Hell may be our destination,
but not this trip.

328
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:56,174
A tomb.

329
00:35:57,646 --> 00:35:59,773
We are in a tomb?

330
00:36:13,228 --> 00:36:17,164
The secrecy is
regrettable, but necessary.

331
00:36:17,232 --> 00:36:19,359
Please, sit.

332
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:30,406
When we were young men...

333
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:33,003
and we saw injustice, we fought it.

334
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:35,845
Now we know that some problems
cannot be solved with a sword.

335
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:37,851
And some can't be settled without one.

336
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:40,581
Here is the problem at hand.

337
00:36:41,322 --> 00:36:44,951
The Jesuits oppose Louis' wars...

338
00:36:45,026 --> 00:36:47,017
and the starvation that results.

339
00:36:47,095 --> 00:36:50,963
So, Louis has ordered me...

340
00:36:51,032 --> 00:36:54,798
to discover the true identity of
the general of the Jesuit order...

341
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:56,564
and to kill him.

342
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:02,732
You should let the secret
general worry about that.

343
00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:04,745
Problem is that...

344
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:08,682
l am he.

345
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,249
l am the general of
the Order of Jesuits.

346
00:37:21,262 --> 00:37:23,253
What do you propose to do?

347
00:37:25,033 --> 00:37:28,127
- Replace the king.
- l cannot listen to this.

348
00:37:28,203 --> 00:37:30,398
- lt can't be done.
- lt can.

349
00:37:30,472 --> 00:37:34,067
- l know the way.
- l am with you.

350
00:37:36,344 --> 00:37:38,574
- So am l.
- No.

351
00:37:38,646 --> 00:37:42,480
l need you. All for one, one for all.

352
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,350
You cannot ask me to betray
my king. l have sworn an oath.

353
00:37:46,421 --> 00:37:50,687
When a king is dishonorable, you
are removed from your oath of honor.

354
00:37:50,759 --> 00:37:54,160
An oath is an oath precisely
because it cannot be removed.

355
00:37:54,229 --> 00:37:57,687
Why do you follow him? Why?

356
00:37:57,766 --> 00:38:01,998
What we fought for is greater
than king or rank or reward!

357
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,004
What do you fight for now?

358
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:08,907
l fight for the belief that every
man can be better, even Louis.

359
00:38:11,312 --> 00:38:13,246
Whatever the plan, l am with you.

360
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:19,409
The next time we meet,
one of us will die.

361
00:38:23,324 --> 00:38:25,724
Athos, wait.

362
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:30,186
Even were l not a priest, l
could see that your heart...

363
00:38:30,265 --> 00:38:32,756
carries a secret weight...

364
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:35,325
and that it is hurting
you to bear it alone.

365
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:42,643
l cannot betray my king.

366
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:47,145
l will defend him with my life.

367
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:50,350
Then God go with you...

368
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:53,286
for none of us will.

369
00:39:51,877 --> 00:39:55,108
l understand that there was an
incident at the Musketeer's gate...

370
00:39:56,548 --> 00:39:59,847
where a man came intent on killing me.

371
00:39:59,918 --> 00:40:04,946
ls it our policy now to allow
would-be assassins to go free?

372
00:40:05,023 --> 00:40:07,548
What he wished to kill was his own pain.

373
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:10,628
His son is dead.

374
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,064
l can think of nothing worse.

375
00:40:14,132 --> 00:40:17,431
- What about losing your king?
- That depends on the king.

376
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,199
When l became a Musketeer, l was
told that each time l drew my sword...

377
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:29,873
l should consider not
what l was killing...

378
00:40:29,948 --> 00:40:32,041
but what l was allowing to live.

379
00:40:32,117 --> 00:40:34,483
Do you know who told me that?

380
00:40:34,553 --> 00:40:37,283
Athos.

381
00:40:37,355 --> 00:40:39,846
Now if he has become our enemy...

382
00:40:41,193 --> 00:40:43,127
we should ask ourselves why.

383
00:40:43,195 --> 00:40:45,493
Well, Athos is gone.

384
00:40:45,564 --> 00:40:49,591
Porthos and Aramis are missing too.

385
00:40:49,668 --> 00:40:52,899
You know them better than anyone.

386
00:40:52,971 --> 00:40:54,871
Are they a threat to me?

387
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,775
lf they are a threat, then we need
not seek them out. They will find us.

388
00:41:08,854 --> 00:41:11,254
Not if you find them first.

389
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,897
- Who is this, then?
- Chi?

390
00:42:47,342 --> 00:42:49,310
He says he's a replacement.

391
00:43:00,822 --> 00:43:04,918
He says it's only one day a month
when the prisoner gets confession.

392
00:43:04,993 --> 00:43:07,052
The usual priest is too sick to move.

393
00:43:34,122 --> 00:43:36,147
lt is my confession day.

394
00:43:47,535 --> 00:43:49,765
l'm sorry, you've never seen
me before. l must shock you.

395
00:43:53,608 --> 00:43:56,577
l am a friend. l'm here to help you.

396
00:44:03,785 --> 00:44:06,583
- What are you doing?
- lt is an escape.

397
00:44:06,654 --> 00:44:08,178
Your escape to freedom.

398
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,388
Who is this?

399
00:44:18,933 --> 00:44:20,525
He is you.

400
00:44:46,127 --> 00:44:51,326
He says he just fell stone dead
as he was reading him the Mass.

401
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:54,163
l never thought he'd last this
long. How could he just keel over?

402
00:44:58,406 --> 00:45:02,001
He says the prisoner has a fever
just like the other priest does.

403
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:04,044
Plague?

404
00:45:04,112 --> 00:45:08,071
They brought plague in here?
Get him out of here, now!

405
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,984
No last rites! Get away!

406
00:45:15,723 --> 00:45:18,658
We could chisel it off...

407
00:45:18,726 --> 00:45:20,785
and see who he was.

408
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:24,397
No one will ever know.

409
00:45:29,604 --> 00:45:32,368
He says burn it or we'll all get plague.

410
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,135
l think he's right.

411
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,715
Don't touch me!

412
00:45:42,183 --> 00:45:44,117
Get out.

413
00:45:47,855 --> 00:45:51,188
Stay back! He's got plague! Get out!

414
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:52,783
Hurry up!

415
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,997
Get away.

416
00:46:01,069 --> 00:46:02,661
Go away. Hurry.

417
00:46:45,147 --> 00:46:47,206
My God.

418
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:27,112
Jesuits. They're mine.

419
00:49:46,595 --> 00:49:48,187
Here.

420
00:49:50,265 --> 00:49:51,857
Drink.

421
00:49:57,472 --> 00:49:59,406
lt's all right.

422
00:50:08,283 --> 00:50:10,274
l have waited six years...

423
00:50:10,352 --> 00:50:12,786
to ask this question.

424
00:50:16,224 --> 00:50:18,988
Why was this done to me?

425
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:20,824
You don't know?

426
00:50:22,864 --> 00:50:25,025
What do you remember?

427
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:29,398
l lived in a country house.

428
00:50:29,471 --> 00:50:33,464
l had guardians, an old
woman and a priest...

429
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:35,476
but no friends.

430
00:50:36,878 --> 00:50:38,869
Then they came and
took me to the prison.

431
00:50:38,947 --> 00:50:42,212
- Who came?
- A man in black.

432
00:50:42,284 --> 00:50:44,718
l never saw his face.

433
00:50:47,689 --> 00:50:51,056
But he took me to the prison...

434
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:53,356
and he put me into the mask.

435
00:50:53,428 --> 00:50:55,328
And you don't know why?

436
00:50:55,397 --> 00:50:59,163
For days l shouted,
''What have l done?''

437
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:05,035
Then l realized that there
was something about my face...

438
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:09,567
which had to be hidden, but
l never knew what it was.

439
00:51:09,645 --> 00:51:11,806
What is your name?

440
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:18,417
The old woman called me Philippe.

441
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:27,426
These men are going to help
clean you up. They won't harm you.

442
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:32,430
Thank you.

443
00:51:36,238 --> 00:51:38,172
Thank you for your kindness.

444
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,974
And why are you so glum?

445
00:51:51,046 --> 00:51:55,244
l expected action. There
was no killing, no fighting.

446
00:51:55,317 --> 00:51:57,251
l was useless.

447
00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:03,752
l grow tired of this attitude.

448
00:52:03,826 --> 00:52:06,124
You're surrounded by beauty...

449
00:52:06,195 --> 00:52:09,562
by intrigue, by danger.

450
00:52:09,632 --> 00:52:12,692
What more could a man want?

451
00:52:12,768 --> 00:52:14,702
Look around you.

452
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:20,234
The robins are singing.
The pigeons are cooing.

453
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:22,743
Can't you listen to their song?

454
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:38,248
There's plenty of food in the country,
since Louis sends it all to the army.

455
00:52:38,327 --> 00:52:40,693
l have no appetite for food.

456
00:52:40,763 --> 00:52:42,663
l'm wasting away.

457
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:46,132
Even women don't interest me anymore.

458
00:52:46,202 --> 00:52:50,161
No, say good-bye to
Porthos, for he is gone.

459
00:52:59,782 --> 00:53:01,716
Who is he?

460
00:53:03,052 --> 00:53:05,282
You seek facts where you
should be seeking the truth.

461
00:53:05,354 --> 00:53:09,586
You're not my priest, Aramis. You
would not be, even if l had one.

462
00:53:09,658 --> 00:53:11,592
That's bitter.

463
00:53:13,395 --> 00:53:15,659
The loss of Raoul...

464
00:53:15,731 --> 00:53:17,858
and of D'Artagnan...

465
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:21,869
who you held as a
brother, and now you hate.

466
00:53:21,937 --> 00:53:25,668
What gives you the right to judge me
and to play God with the lives of others?

467
00:53:25,741 --> 00:53:28,107
Are you so much holier
than everyone else?

468
00:53:28,177 --> 00:53:31,943
Yes, there is that, but also because
l'm more intelligent than anybody else.

469
00:53:38,787 --> 00:53:41,449
- What is it?
- Kidney stones.

470
00:53:41,523 --> 00:53:45,459
lt hurts when l piss.
lt hurts when l shit.

471
00:53:45,527 --> 00:53:49,793
l'm just a fat old fart with
nothing to live for anymore.

472
00:53:49,865 --> 00:53:54,199
l'm going to hang myself
as soon as l'm sober.

473
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,204
Come on.

474
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,030
He's ready.

475
00:54:25,756 --> 00:54:29,351
The greatest mystery of life...

476
00:54:29,426 --> 00:54:31,792
is who we truly are.

477
00:54:32,529 --> 00:54:34,190
Yes.

478
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:40,127
l'm going to tell you the secret that's
been kept from you your whole life.

479
00:54:41,005 --> 00:54:43,439
lt began the night King Louis was born.

480
00:54:43,507 --> 00:54:44,974
l remember that night.

481
00:54:45,042 --> 00:54:47,203
D'Artagnan, Athos and l were dining.

482
00:54:47,277 --> 00:54:51,373
D'Artagnan was dead drunk- the only
time l've ever seen him like that.

483
00:54:52,182 --> 00:54:53,615
But l was on duty.

484
00:54:53,684 --> 00:54:57,017
l was summoned to a rear
door of the palace...

485
00:54:57,087 --> 00:55:01,251
where the queen's own priest
placed a baby in my arms.

486
00:55:01,325 --> 00:55:04,158
Do you understand this,
Athos? lt confuses me.

487
00:55:04,228 --> 00:55:06,822
The queen had given
birth to twins that night.

488
00:55:06,897 --> 00:55:09,923
And the child l carried
was the younger of the two.

489
00:55:14,071 --> 00:55:16,869
Another. lt's another.

490
00:55:21,512 --> 00:55:23,810
Suddenly, the old king
discovered he had two heirs.

491
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:26,406
He'd seen enough kingdoms torn
apart by feuding brothers...

492
00:55:26,483 --> 00:55:30,010
so he decided, for the sake of
peace, to make one disappear.

493
00:55:30,087 --> 00:55:31,418
You, Philippe.

494
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:35,315
He ordered your true
identity kept from you.

495
00:55:35,392 --> 00:55:39,328
On his deathbed, he revealed your
existence to Louis and your mother.

496
00:55:39,396 --> 00:55:42,729
She had been told by her own
priest that you had died at birth.

497
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,031
She blamed herself for
ever believing it...

498
00:55:46,103 --> 00:55:48,401
and she wished to
restore your birthright.

499
00:55:50,107 --> 00:55:52,575
But now Louis was king.

500
00:55:52,643 --> 00:55:54,474
He was afraid to kill you.

501
00:55:54,545 --> 00:55:59,107
For his whole claim of power rested
on the sanctity of royal blood.

502
00:55:59,183 --> 00:56:02,914
So, instead, he devised a way
to keep you forever hidden.

503
00:56:07,658 --> 00:56:09,592
For my country...

504
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,594
for my king...

505
00:56:11,662 --> 00:56:14,062
l bought peace...

506
00:56:14,131 --> 00:56:16,065
with your life.

507
00:56:17,034 --> 00:56:19,696
And with my soul.

508
00:56:21,038 --> 00:56:23,302
One day...

509
00:56:23,373 --> 00:56:25,705
l will ask for your forgiveness.

510
00:56:27,544 --> 00:56:30,138
But not until l have restored you...

511
00:56:30,214 --> 00:56:31,841
to what is yours.

512
00:56:31,915 --> 00:56:33,382
Restored?

513
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,918
We will replace Louis with Philippe.

514
00:56:35,986 --> 00:56:37,954
That is your plan?

515
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:42,014
Exchanging one for the
other? lt's ludicrous!

516
00:56:42,092 --> 00:56:45,186
lt's brilliant. What did
you imagine we were up to?

517
00:56:45,262 --> 00:56:47,457
Revolution! Open war!

518
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:50,091
- Blood in the streets.
- At least it's a change.

519
00:56:50,167 --> 00:56:52,465
Physical resemblance is but a beginning.

520
00:56:52,536 --> 00:56:54,936
Louis has an arrogance, a manner-

521
00:56:55,005 --> 00:56:57,530
- Which can be adopted.
- And people close to him.

522
00:56:57,608 --> 00:57:00,736
Do you imagine that l've
not considered everything?

523
00:57:00,811 --> 00:57:04,713
Have you considered that it is
not only our lives that you risk?

524
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:08,717
- lt is Philippe's as well.
- Yes, and like us, he has a choice.

525
00:57:12,389 --> 00:57:14,857
What about it, Philippe?

526
00:57:16,426 --> 00:57:19,122
All those years in prison.

527
00:57:19,196 --> 00:57:21,187
Were they for nothing?

528
00:57:21,265 --> 00:57:25,463
Or have they given you reserves
of strength unlike ordinary men?

529
00:57:25,536 --> 00:57:28,835
You have the chance to be a king...

530
00:57:28,906 --> 00:57:32,467
if you have the heart
to take that chance.

531
00:57:32,543 --> 00:57:35,239
Do you have that heart?

532
00:57:37,481 --> 00:57:39,415
l-

533
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:24,953
Your Majesty, a box has arrived
with strict instructions...

534
00:58:25,028 --> 00:58:27,462
that its contents are
for your eyes alone.

535
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:35,435
Take this to my mother.

536
00:59:29,826 --> 00:59:31,760
My son.

537
00:59:39,936 --> 00:59:43,633
Please forgive me.

538
00:59:45,676 --> 00:59:48,770
l can never make it right.

539
00:59:48,845 --> 00:59:50,403
My lady.

540
01:00:31,121 --> 01:00:34,955
lf anyone sees, it is death.

541
01:00:35,025 --> 01:00:37,118
lf l don't kiss you, l'll die anyway.

542
01:00:46,803 --> 01:00:48,998
l cannot bear to see you cry.

543
01:00:50,474 --> 01:00:52,408
Please.

544
01:00:54,177 --> 01:00:56,145
Tell me what's wrong.

545
01:01:08,191 --> 01:01:11,285
l know that to love you is
a treason against France...

546
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:16,958
but not to love you is a
treason against my heart.

547
01:01:17,033 --> 01:01:20,366
Then we will both die traitors.

548
01:01:30,289 --> 01:01:32,223
More wine.

549
01:01:36,428 --> 01:01:38,362
How is he?

550
01:01:39,265 --> 01:01:41,597
Exhausted.

551
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:43,931
He's had a long day.

552
01:01:44,003 --> 01:01:45,971
- Aramis-
- More wine!

553
01:01:46,038 --> 01:01:47,869
You must reconsider this plan.

554
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:50,636
Philippe is like a child.
He cannot possibly be ready-

555
01:01:50,709 --> 01:01:52,336
- You can do it.
- No.

556
01:01:52,411 --> 01:01:54,675
- Yes, you can.
- ln one year, maybe two.

557
01:01:54,747 --> 01:01:56,681
Three weeks.

558
01:01:58,918 --> 01:02:02,513
The king is having a
ball, a masquerade ball.

559
01:02:02,588 --> 01:02:05,421
A swirl of people, their faces covered.

560
01:02:05,491 --> 01:02:08,255
lt is our perfect opportunity
and maybe the only one.

561
01:02:08,327 --> 01:02:10,522
Philippe could be discovered
at any time. And what then?

562
01:02:10,596 --> 01:02:12,757
More wine! Where is everybody?

563
01:02:15,301 --> 01:02:17,394
No, it's no use.

564
01:02:18,971 --> 01:02:22,134
- My sword is bent.
- lt'll be all right.

565
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:24,768
You're just taking a
while to get started.

566
01:02:26,078 --> 01:02:29,639
- l can make your sword straight.
- No, it's dead.

567
01:02:31,383 --> 01:02:33,317
l'm useless.

568
01:02:37,523 --> 01:02:40,959
Three weeks to learn
all that he must know?

569
01:02:41,026 --> 01:02:43,517
For 16 years he was
educated as a gentleman.

570
01:02:43,596 --> 01:02:47,396
And for six more, he lived
in that mask, not knowing why.

571
01:02:47,466 --> 01:02:52,529
Now he knows those who should have
loved him tore him from his birthright...

572
01:02:52,605 --> 01:02:55,631
and threw him into loneliness and pain.

573
01:02:57,142 --> 01:02:59,337
You grow fond of him. That's good.

574
01:02:59,411 --> 01:03:04,405
Do not play God with me.
Nothing can replace Raoul.

575
01:03:11,023 --> 01:03:12,991
What is Porthos doing?

576
01:03:13,058 --> 01:03:15,720
Walking into the barn
naked, or so it would seem.

577
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:19,354
But what is he doing?

578
01:03:19,431 --> 01:03:22,195
About to hang himself. He's been
threatening to do it for months.

579
01:03:22,268 --> 01:03:23,701
Hang himself?

580
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,399
A sign from God.

581
01:03:39,018 --> 01:03:42,784
lf Porthos is determined
to end his life...

582
01:03:42,855 --> 01:03:45,915
then he's bound to find
the opportunity, isn't he?

583
01:03:51,597 --> 01:03:53,531
Good-bye, cruel world.

584
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:56,965
Farewell to useless Porthos.

585
01:04:05,511 --> 01:04:08,071
- What was that?
- lt's all right. l sawed the beam.

586
01:04:13,819 --> 01:04:15,582
l'm a genius, not an engineer.

587
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:19,923
ls he still there?

588
01:04:24,096 --> 01:04:26,394
Aramis, you did this!

589
01:04:26,465 --> 01:04:31,767
You knew l would try hanging myself
and you sawed the beam! Admit it!

590
01:04:32,404 --> 01:04:35,168
Of course l knew. You've
been moping around for months.

591
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,674
Now that you've tried
to kill yourself...

592
01:04:37,743 --> 01:04:41,474
you can stop boring everybody
and be useful for a change.

593
01:04:42,281 --> 01:04:43,248
Well.

594
01:04:43,315 --> 01:04:45,180
And put some clothes on.

595
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,245
Well, okay.

596
01:05:11,777 --> 01:05:16,111
l've worn this mask so long,
l don't feel safe without it.

597
01:05:16,181 --> 01:05:19,378
l will sit with you.
l can't sleep either.

598
01:07:06,014 --> 01:07:08,642
l've been in prison for six years.

599
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,248
You freed me.

600
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:17,758
But now you're asking me
to enter another prison.

601
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:19,589
The palace is hardly a prison.

602
01:07:23,765 --> 01:07:26,859
See those farm maids working there?

603
01:07:26,935 --> 01:07:29,096
See the one holding the lamb?

604
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:32,162
l would tend lambs with
her for the rest of my life.

605
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,438
We're offering you a chance to be king.

606
01:07:38,947 --> 01:07:41,438
You're offering me a chance
to pretend to be king.

607
01:07:43,218 --> 01:07:45,277
A king that you hate.

608
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:48,018
Not everyone hates him.

609
01:07:49,257 --> 01:07:50,315
Don't you?

610
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,018
Why should l become him?

611
01:07:55,096 --> 01:07:57,326
Until you give me a
reason, l won't do it.

612
01:08:01,236 --> 01:08:02,203
l cannot.

613
01:08:03,038 --> 01:08:06,064
We're all God's instruments,
whether we like it or not.

614
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,335
All we can do is keep faith.

615
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:11,777
Even though l admit l
sometimes find that hard to do.

616
01:08:11,846 --> 01:08:14,371
We all fail at faith, you know?

617
01:08:14,449 --> 01:08:18,010
That's why we must eat,
drink and make love to life.

618
01:08:18,953 --> 01:08:21,046
As king, if you like plow maids...

619
01:08:21,122 --> 01:08:23,056
you can have a thousand.

620
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:26,921
- You missed the point.
- What point?

621
01:08:26,995 --> 01:08:29,930
Philippe is right.

622
01:08:29,998 --> 01:08:33,957
We haven't given him a reason
to do what we ask of him.

623
01:08:34,035 --> 01:08:35,900
l understand your reason.

624
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:37,870
You understand my reason?

625
01:08:37,939 --> 01:08:40,499
Porthos told me about your son.

626
01:08:44,646 --> 01:08:46,580
And you think that's why l'm here?

627
01:08:49,984 --> 01:08:53,420
Yes, Raoul is my reason,
but not in the way you think.

628
01:08:53,488 --> 01:08:57,015
Once all of us believed
in spending our lives...

629
01:08:57,092 --> 01:09:00,550
in the service of something
greater than ourselves.

630
01:09:00,628 --> 01:09:01,993
Aramis had his faith.

631
01:09:02,063 --> 01:09:06,124
Porthos, his lust for life.
D'Artagnan, his devotion.

632
01:09:07,302 --> 01:09:09,236
And l had Raoul.

633
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:13,331
But we all had a common dream-

634
01:09:13,408 --> 01:09:18,471
that one day we would finally be able
to serve a king worthy of the throne.

635
01:09:20,215 --> 01:09:22,342
lt is what we dreamt...

636
01:09:22,417 --> 01:09:25,011
what we bled for...

637
01:09:25,086 --> 01:09:28,385
and what we have spent a
lifetime waiting to see.

638
01:09:29,491 --> 01:09:32,051
l taught Raoul to believe in that dream.

639
01:09:33,161 --> 01:09:35,595
And now my son is dead.

640
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:42,629
So l am here to find out
if his life was in vain.

641
01:09:45,006 --> 01:09:48,498
And the only one who can
answer that question is you.

642
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:09,929
lf we fail in this attempt...

643
01:10:11,532 --> 01:10:13,466
and we probably will...

644
01:10:15,103 --> 01:10:17,094
l'll be honored to die beside you.

645
01:10:22,977 --> 01:10:24,945
And you.

646
01:11:35,622 --> 01:11:37,556
This has arrived for you.

647
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:45,989
My darling Christine.

648
01:11:46,066 --> 01:11:49,399
ln parting from you, l
have left heaven for hell.

649
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:54,336
l go because l can
love you only in honor.

650
01:11:56,076 --> 01:11:58,601
You've created in me the
need to be a better man.

651
01:11:59,779 --> 01:12:02,304
l will love through heaven or hell...

652
01:12:02,382 --> 01:12:04,282
if that is where l must go...

653
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:06,284
to love you as you should be loved.

654
01:12:08,054 --> 01:12:10,784
Remember that and
give yourself no blame.

655
01:12:12,025 --> 01:12:14,391
Yours forever, Raoul.

656
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,954
What's wrong?

657
01:12:47,861 --> 01:12:49,795
What's the matter?

658
01:12:58,338 --> 01:13:00,272
What's wrong?

659
01:13:01,774 --> 01:13:03,742
l received a letter from Raoul.

660
01:13:04,944 --> 01:13:07,174
He sent it to the palace...

661
01:13:07,247 --> 01:13:09,841
knowing that he would die...

662
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:11,850
and l would be here.

663
01:13:14,921 --> 01:13:16,855
How would he know that?

664
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,926
l-

665
01:13:22,996 --> 01:13:25,692
l can't guess what he was thinking.

666
01:13:25,765 --> 01:13:28,256
He was irrational.

667
01:13:28,334 --> 01:13:31,269
l ordered him placed far
from the fighting, but...

668
01:13:34,707 --> 01:13:38,143
he plunged in against my wishes.

669
01:13:38,211 --> 01:13:42,409
He forgives me for all
that he knew l would do.

670
01:13:42,482 --> 01:13:44,416
But can l forgive myself?

671
01:13:45,818 --> 01:13:46,785
Forgive?

672
01:13:47,887 --> 01:13:49,821
l loved him.

673
01:13:50,890 --> 01:13:52,824
l love him still.

674
01:14:00,266 --> 01:14:01,426
Still.

675
01:14:02,368 --> 01:14:05,496
And in pretending to love
you, l do something awful.

676
01:14:08,808 --> 01:14:10,799
You pretend.

677
01:14:15,014 --> 01:14:19,917
l have sinned against love and
God for the sake of your mercy...

678
01:14:19,986 --> 01:14:22,454
which you would not have
given without my sin.

679
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:25,917
l will burn in hell.

680
01:14:25,992 --> 01:14:27,653
So will you.

681
01:14:30,997 --> 01:14:32,931
No, my love.

682
01:14:34,434 --> 01:14:37,096
You will burn in hell.

683
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:38,660
l will not.

684
01:14:38,738 --> 01:14:41,002
For l am king...

685
01:14:41,074 --> 01:14:43,304
ordained by God!

686
01:15:00,124 --> 01:15:04,026
Come on! We have no time!

687
01:15:04,094 --> 01:15:06,654
- Here! My bag!
- Where are you going?

688
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:09,358
There's still much to be done.
l'll be gone for a few days.

689
01:15:09,433 --> 01:15:11,526
Make sure everything is
ready when l get back.

690
01:15:11,602 --> 01:15:15,333
You want me to do the
impossible and do it alone?

691
01:15:15,405 --> 01:15:18,636
l offer you the perfect solution-
a revolution without bloodshed...

692
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:21,473
without loss of life,
even without treason.

693
01:15:21,545 --> 01:15:23,172
For he, too, is a king's son. Thank you.

694
01:15:23,247 --> 01:15:26,239
But l can't get him ready.
We'll never have time.

695
01:15:26,316 --> 01:15:28,113
The urgency is not my choice.

696
01:15:28,185 --> 01:15:30,176
lnstead of distributing
the promised food...

697
01:15:30,254 --> 01:15:32,745
Louis has ordered that
all rioters be shot.

698
01:15:32,823 --> 01:15:36,259
Go on. Can you imagine
what will happen...

699
01:15:36,326 --> 01:15:39,784
when the starving people of
Paris hear about his new ball?

700
01:15:39,863 --> 01:15:41,797
This is not for me.

701
01:15:41,865 --> 01:15:44,800
This is for everything we
once were and might be again.

702
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,283
Thank you, Father.

703
01:16:08,262 --> 01:16:10,822
The ball has been brought
forward to tomorrow night.

704
01:16:10,898 --> 01:16:11,956
Tomorrow? Why?

705
01:16:12,032 --> 01:16:15,263
The king is unhappy with his mistress
and seeks revelry to lift his spirits.

706
01:16:15,336 --> 01:16:17,896
l cannot be ready unless
my tailors work all night.

707
01:16:17,972 --> 01:16:19,462
Saddle my horse!

708
01:16:30,184 --> 01:16:32,277
The brothel is closed for the night!

709
01:16:32,353 --> 01:16:34,048
Everybody, out, except the ladies!

710
01:16:34,121 --> 01:16:35,486
Out!

711
01:16:35,556 --> 01:16:40,289
- Closed? We came here-
- Go somewhere else tonight! Out!

712
01:16:42,129 --> 01:16:45,121
Ladies, l need you to finish
my clothes you're making for me.

713
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:48,566
We'll go and we'll take
your money with you.

714
01:16:48,636 --> 01:16:50,001
Come on, old man. Quickly!

715
01:16:51,105 --> 01:16:53,972
You try to rob me
because you think me old?

716
01:17:05,352 --> 01:17:08,879
Let's see if you rob somebody
with you pistol up there!

717
01:17:08,956 --> 01:17:11,823
Out! Everybody, out!

718
01:17:16,597 --> 01:17:18,258
l finished this for you.

719
01:17:18,332 --> 01:17:21,426
l love Paris. l love life.

720
01:17:21,502 --> 01:17:24,096
And l love you, ladies.

721
01:17:24,171 --> 01:17:27,038
Now get busy. Except for you.

722
01:17:31,245 --> 01:17:32,371
No, wait.

723
01:17:32,446 --> 01:17:34,346
With a king it is so.

724
01:17:34,415 --> 01:17:37,282
Servants have touched the
goblet of the king, therefore...

725
01:17:37,351 --> 01:17:39,046
he will touch it as little as possible.

726
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:40,051
Again.

727
01:17:46,627 --> 01:17:48,322
- l'm sorry.
- No.

728
01:17:48,395 --> 01:17:51,364
- l didn't-
- Do not be sorry.

729
01:17:51,432 --> 01:17:53,730
There are no mistakes
when you are the king.

730
01:17:53,801 --> 01:17:56,133
You must never apologize.

731
01:17:56,203 --> 01:17:58,694
The king cares for
nothing and for no one.

732
01:17:58,772 --> 01:18:01,070
ls that the kind of
king you wish me to be?

733
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:05,376
Or do you say this
because your son is dead?

734
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,254
Forgive me. l would
never mean to disrespect-

735
01:18:15,322 --> 01:18:18,758
l'm not angry with
you. Do you understand?

736
01:18:21,462 --> 01:18:25,125
Good. Of course we wish
you to be a good king.

737
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,133
But first you must pass as Louis.

738
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:29,135
And Louis is cold and cruel.

739
01:18:29,203 --> 01:18:33,606
The eyes of this king say that
he cares for nothing but himself.

740
01:18:34,508 --> 01:18:36,499
Your eyes ask too much.

741
01:18:36,577 --> 01:18:39,637
You shouldn't care about me.

742
01:18:45,019 --> 01:18:47,954
You mustn't ask about my son.

743
01:18:57,765 --> 01:19:00,825
Bless me, Father, for l have sinned.

744
01:19:03,103 --> 01:19:05,333
And so have l.

745
01:19:07,107 --> 01:19:08,506
Your Majesty.

746
01:19:10,077 --> 01:19:12,011
l have come to ask you
whether you believe that...

747
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:14,309
just as one lie can destroy a life...

748
01:19:15,749 --> 01:19:19,185
so one truth can put it together again.

749
01:19:19,253 --> 01:19:22,313
l have prayed every
day for such a miracle.

750
01:19:22,389 --> 01:19:25,324
l have prayed every day for forgiveness.

751
01:19:25,392 --> 01:19:28,088
But now l know that forgiveness
must first come from you...

752
01:19:28,162 --> 01:19:30,653
before it can come from God.

753
01:19:30,731 --> 01:19:34,189
For it was l who took the second
of your twin sons away from you.

754
01:19:34,268 --> 01:19:36,293
And l was never brave enough...

755
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:39,999
to find the truth when l was
told one lie after another.

756
01:19:40,074 --> 01:19:43,703
l have raised a son
who destroys lives...

757
01:19:43,777 --> 01:19:45,802
instead of saving them.

758
01:19:45,879 --> 01:19:48,404
And l have failed...

759
01:19:48,482 --> 01:19:52,043
to save a son who died
within an iron mask.

760
01:19:53,153 --> 01:19:55,587
That mask was the creation of Louis.

761
01:19:55,656 --> 01:19:57,783
Now God and we...

762
01:19:57,858 --> 01:20:02,227
have the chance to make a miracle
to strip all masks away forever.

763
01:20:04,704 --> 01:20:06,331
These rooms are yours.

764
01:20:07,406 --> 01:20:09,874
Through this corridor
and up the stairway...

765
01:20:09,942 --> 01:20:12,638
or through this secret
passageway to the floor above...

766
01:20:12,712 --> 01:20:15,078
are the rooms of your
mistress, Christine.

767
01:20:15,147 --> 01:20:18,275
And whose rooms are these?

768
01:20:18,351 --> 01:20:19,716
Your mother's.

769
01:20:23,623 --> 01:20:24,612
My mother's?

770
01:20:30,963 --> 01:20:33,193
Change the horses!

771
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:39,765
Clear out everything!

772
01:20:39,839 --> 01:20:41,033
Now!

773
01:20:51,484 --> 01:20:54,180
Remember, Philippe, nobility
is born in the heart.

774
01:20:54,253 --> 01:20:57,916
Make love as if you don't care.
And fart whenever you wish.

775
01:20:57,990 --> 01:21:02,518
Hold your goblet with two fingers. All
you have to do is get through tonight.

776
01:21:02,595 --> 01:21:04,392
Smile and nod a lot. lf you get stuck...

777
01:21:04,463 --> 01:21:06,454
just wave and announce, ''Continue.''

778
01:21:06,532 --> 01:21:09,365
ln the morning, order that
Athos, Porthos and Aramis...

779
01:21:09,435 --> 01:21:11,835
be brought to the
palace as your advisors.

780
01:21:11,904 --> 01:21:14,566
And all will be well.

781
01:21:56,482 --> 01:21:59,383
D'Artagnan watches everything.
We have to be lucky.

782
01:21:59,452 --> 01:22:02,250
We make our own luck
tonight, if Philippe holds up.

783
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:07,150
Relax, Philippe, you're doing well.

784
01:22:25,611 --> 01:22:27,101
My brother.

785
01:22:47,933 --> 01:22:49,992
What is wrong, Your Majesty?

786
01:22:52,772 --> 01:22:54,706
Nothing. Carry on.

787
01:23:09,889 --> 01:23:11,823
Did you see that?

788
01:23:12,892 --> 01:23:16,589
- See what, Your Majesty?
- A mask. l distinctly saw a mask.

789
01:23:16,662 --> 01:23:20,359
Well, the ballroom is full
of masks, Your Majesty.

790
01:23:50,463 --> 01:23:51,657
Your Majesty.

791
01:23:54,667 --> 01:23:56,794
Carry on, everyone.

792
01:23:59,972 --> 01:24:02,031
ls he all right?

793
01:24:02,775 --> 01:24:04,670
To the passageway.

794
01:24:06,372 --> 01:24:08,306
Your Majesty.

795
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,134
lt's judgement day.

796
01:24:51,283 --> 01:24:54,116
Don't look so shocked, Philippe.

797
01:24:54,854 --> 01:24:56,913
Why do you call me Philippe?

798
01:24:58,691 --> 01:25:00,625
We have a prison for you.

799
01:25:17,843 --> 01:25:19,777
D'Artagnan guards the hallway.

800
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,814
You must go back the way we came.

801
01:25:24,216 --> 01:25:26,150
Time to go, Your Majesty.

802
01:25:46,272 --> 01:25:48,206
You know the way.

803
01:26:16,402 --> 01:26:18,996
You have the heart of a king.

804
01:27:34,459 --> 01:27:35,756
Continue.

805
01:27:47,672 --> 01:27:49,606
Your Majesty.

806
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:55,437
Some refreshments, Your Majesty?

807
01:28:37,889 --> 01:28:39,447
The Queen Mother!

808
01:29:53,397 --> 01:29:55,831
God bless the king and the Queen Mother!

809
01:30:40,144 --> 01:30:42,510
l'll retire now.

810
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:44,548
Wait two dances...

811
01:30:44,615 --> 01:30:46,549
then withdraw to your room...

812
01:30:47,418 --> 01:30:49,648
and spend the night in safety.

813
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:52,917
We have much to talk about...

814
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:55,720
and have the rest of our lives to do it.

815
01:30:57,795 --> 01:30:59,729
Good night...

816
01:31:02,233 --> 01:31:03,393
Mother.

817
01:31:05,269 --> 01:31:07,203
Good night...

818
01:31:09,173 --> 01:31:11,107
my son.

819
01:31:32,163 --> 01:31:35,155
Anne. What-

820
01:31:35,232 --> 01:31:37,166
Tomorrow.

821
01:31:55,152 --> 01:31:57,552
How long has the king been back?

822
01:31:57,621 --> 01:31:58,952
Some while, Captain.

823
01:32:13,738 --> 01:32:15,035
Murderer!

824
01:32:20,678 --> 01:32:24,705
l wrote to the front under your seal.

825
01:32:25,449 --> 01:32:27,440
l wrote as you...

826
01:32:27,518 --> 01:32:30,385
demanding to know why the
general disregarded the order...

827
01:32:30,454 --> 01:32:33,252
to keep Raoul out of danger.

828
01:32:33,324 --> 01:32:35,485
He writes back...

829
01:32:35,559 --> 01:32:37,925
''But, Your Majesty...

830
01:32:37,995 --> 01:32:41,692
your last letter ordered me to place
him at the vanguard of the assault...

831
01:32:41,766 --> 01:32:44,326
just in front of the cannon.''

832
01:32:44,402 --> 01:32:46,632
You killed Raoul!

833
01:32:49,507 --> 01:32:51,634
Stop! You're hurting her!

834
01:33:03,721 --> 01:33:07,487
However l have wronged
you, l will make amends.

835
01:33:27,011 --> 01:33:28,911
Take her to her room.

836
01:33:33,017 --> 01:33:36,418
Deploy the Musketeers.
Guard all the passages.

837
01:33:39,857 --> 01:33:41,791
Continue.

838
01:33:50,267 --> 01:33:54,135
We have an emergency of
security, Your Majesty.

839
01:33:54,205 --> 01:33:56,639
l must ask you to accompany me.

840
01:33:58,642 --> 01:34:00,576
Not now.

841
01:34:00,644 --> 01:34:03,442
The ball. My guests.

842
01:34:05,316 --> 01:34:08,183
l insist, Your Majesty.

843
01:34:11,489 --> 01:34:13,423
Yes, certainly.

844
01:34:47,752 --> 01:34:49,117
They've raised the alarm!

845
01:34:49,721 --> 01:34:51,916
- They'll try to cut us off.
- Reverse the flow!

846
01:35:46,911 --> 01:35:48,606
l am Porthos!

847
01:35:50,014 --> 01:35:52,005
And l fight the king!

848
01:36:06,197 --> 01:36:08,028
Come on! Porthos!

849
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:15,466
Everyone, pump!

850
01:36:18,443 --> 01:36:21,810
Stop them before they reach the river!

851
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:27,709
Pull them back!

852
01:37:30,348 --> 01:37:33,442
This man is an impostor.

853
01:37:34,685 --> 01:37:36,880
This is the impostor.

854
01:37:39,457 --> 01:37:40,788
Pull them back!

855
01:37:51,402 --> 01:37:53,267
Get in the boat, Your Majesty.

856
01:38:01,612 --> 01:38:03,273
Open the gate.

857
01:38:13,124 --> 01:38:14,557
l failed you.

858
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:21,830
We failed you.

859
01:38:33,511 --> 01:38:34,944
Stop!

860
01:38:43,354 --> 01:38:47,814
You take my king, and
l shall take yours.

861
01:39:03,307 --> 01:39:05,241
Catch him! Seize him!

862
01:39:26,297 --> 01:39:27,423
Hold him!

863
01:40:06,096 --> 01:40:08,894
l was told this impostor was dead.

864
01:40:10,667 --> 01:40:12,601
You knew?

865
01:40:14,337 --> 01:40:17,067
You knew there was a
man of such resemblance?

866
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:18,471
He is my brother.

867
01:40:19,442 --> 01:40:21,637
- Brother?
- My twin.

868
01:40:22,412 --> 01:40:24,778
My blood.

869
01:40:24,848 --> 01:40:28,375
A fact which has kept
him alive, until now.

870
01:40:36,927 --> 01:40:37,951
Please.

871
01:40:39,129 --> 01:40:42,860
- You were a part of this?
- He's your brother! l love you both!

872
01:40:42,933 --> 01:40:44,992
Your love has meant
nothing to either of us!

873
01:40:45,068 --> 01:40:47,002
lt has meant something to me.

874
01:40:50,774 --> 01:40:52,139
Your Majesty, listen to me.

875
01:40:53,844 --> 01:40:55,744
Never once have l asked
anything for myself.

876
01:40:55,812 --> 01:40:59,680
l ask you now: Spare
the life of this man...

877
01:40:59,749 --> 01:41:01,512
this prisoner, your brother.

878
01:41:01,585 --> 01:41:03,849
You have no right to ask me this!

879
01:41:11,928 --> 01:41:13,361
Your Majesty...

880
01:41:14,497 --> 01:41:16,397
every day of your life...

881
01:41:16,466 --> 01:41:19,060
l have watched over you.

882
01:41:19,135 --> 01:41:22,127
l have bled for you.

883
01:41:22,205 --> 01:41:26,608
l have prayed every day to see you
become greater than your office...

884
01:41:26,676 --> 01:41:29,076
better than the law.

885
01:41:29,145 --> 01:41:34,412
Please show me what my faith and
my blood have purchased. Show mercy.

886
01:41:34,484 --> 01:41:37,681
And you take the side of traitors.

887
01:41:37,754 --> 01:41:41,884
Of this one, worst of all,
who's tried to do this to me!

888
01:41:41,958 --> 01:41:43,789
And what have you done to him?

889
01:41:48,498 --> 01:41:49,487
For one moment...

890
01:41:50,734 --> 01:41:53,999
l thought you had become the
king l always hoped you'd be.

891
01:41:58,775 --> 01:42:00,072
Please.

892
01:42:00,911 --> 01:42:03,311
My lord, may l speak?

893
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:05,507
l beg that you kill me.

894
01:42:06,583 --> 01:42:09,450
l release you from any
sin in taking my life.

895
01:42:09,519 --> 01:42:13,250
ln fact, l pray that God reward
you for your mercy to do it.

896
01:42:14,591 --> 01:42:16,616
But please...

897
01:42:16,693 --> 01:42:20,493
do not, l beg you...

898
01:42:20,563 --> 01:42:24,932
return me to the prison where
l have lived for so long.

899
01:42:32,275 --> 01:42:34,243
You will hunt down Porthos...

900
01:42:34,311 --> 01:42:38,042
Athos and Aramis and
bring me their heads...

901
01:42:38,114 --> 01:42:40,480
or l will have yours.

902
01:42:48,391 --> 01:42:50,791
And as for you, my brother...

903
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:52,555
back to the prison you shall go...

904
01:42:52,629 --> 01:42:55,325
and into the mask you hate.

905
01:42:55,398 --> 01:42:57,832
Wear it until you love it!

906
01:42:59,936 --> 01:43:01,870
And die in it.

907
01:43:20,190 --> 01:43:21,680
There were two?

908
01:43:21,758 --> 01:43:24,784
Not one, but two?

909
01:43:24,861 --> 01:43:28,422
l couldn't tell you.
You had enough to bear.

910
01:43:31,334 --> 01:43:33,962
l have loved you always.

911
01:43:34,037 --> 01:43:35,265
None but you.

912
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:38,903
No matter what happens...

913
01:43:39,876 --> 01:43:42,174
l pray you remember that.

914
01:43:54,724 --> 01:43:56,658
Christine's room.

915
01:44:16,646 --> 01:44:18,580
Where is she?

916
01:44:33,196 --> 01:44:35,255
Get rid of it.

917
01:44:45,975 --> 01:44:48,205
Where are you taking me?

918
01:44:49,612 --> 01:44:51,546
Please, no!

919
01:45:26,916 --> 01:45:29,612
lt has been done as you
ordered, Your Majesty.

920
01:45:29,686 --> 01:45:32,450
When D'Artagnan returns, watch him.

921
01:45:32,522 --> 01:45:34,456
And when he leaves again, you tell me.

922
01:45:36,593 --> 01:45:38,527
Your Majesty.

923
01:45:46,958 --> 01:45:49,017
- Nothing down here, sir.
- Try this way.

924
01:46:13,552 --> 01:46:16,953
Philippe has been moved to the
lower dungeon of the Bastille.

925
01:46:17,022 --> 01:46:19,013
At midnight, l will
order the guard changed...

926
01:46:19,090 --> 01:46:21,422
and will delay the
replacements for ten minutes.

927
01:46:21,493 --> 01:46:23,427
One for all. All for one.

928
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:28,258
lt is a trap, but we have no choice.

929
01:46:28,333 --> 01:46:30,301
lf Philippe is in the Bastille...

930
01:46:30,368 --> 01:46:32,495
then to the Bastille we will go.

931
01:46:33,705 --> 01:46:35,798
l'd rather die covered in blood...

932
01:46:35,874 --> 01:46:38,638
than an old man lying in my own piss.

933
01:46:56,728 --> 01:46:58,662
Our old uniforms.

934
01:47:00,365 --> 01:47:01,992
From our days of glory.

935
01:47:03,568 --> 01:47:05,627
l was saving them so that...

936
01:47:06,504 --> 01:47:08,768
we could wear them in death.

937
01:47:11,309 --> 01:47:12,901
And so we shall!

938
01:47:23,955 --> 01:47:25,855
Open up. We have a prisoner.

939
01:47:35,767 --> 01:47:39,464
Take him down to level three. The
captain will see to the document.

940
01:47:46,111 --> 01:47:48,238
lt worked.

941
01:47:48,313 --> 01:47:50,713
lt's a prison. Of course
it's no trouble getting in.

942
01:47:50,782 --> 01:47:53,376
The problems will come
when we want to get out.

943
01:48:03,595 --> 01:48:05,529
lt's midnight. We have ten minutes.

944
01:48:56,348 --> 01:48:58,282
Down there.

945
01:49:10,628 --> 01:49:12,562
ls this what you're looking for?

946
01:49:18,403 --> 01:49:19,335
The key.

947
01:49:22,574 --> 01:49:23,836
Remember this?

948
01:49:25,043 --> 01:49:28,069
Don't look so sad. There's
nothing left of him anyway.

949
01:49:28,146 --> 01:49:31,843
He was just a snivelling, drooling-

950
01:49:33,218 --> 01:49:34,583
l knew you'd come.

951
01:49:34,652 --> 01:49:36,882
We feared the mask would destroy you.

952
01:49:36,955 --> 01:49:39,389
l wear the mask; it does not wear me.

953
01:50:14,033 --> 01:50:16,263
- The courtyard is blocked.
- He lies.

954
01:50:16,335 --> 01:50:17,768
He's here to trap us.

955
01:50:17,837 --> 01:50:19,771
See for yourselves.

956
01:50:23,009 --> 01:50:25,273
All that you have suffered...

957
01:50:25,344 --> 01:50:28,074
l would gladly have borne
myself to keep it from you.

958
01:50:33,753 --> 01:50:35,482
You men, to the east gate.

959
01:50:35,555 --> 01:50:38,319
D'Artagnan is right. The
courtyard is filling with soldiers.

960
01:50:38,391 --> 01:50:39,323
This way.

961
01:50:53,506 --> 01:50:55,303
Don't stop till you reach the river.

962
01:50:55,374 --> 01:50:57,308
lf we go this way,
they'll know you helped us.

963
01:50:57,376 --> 01:50:59,310
That doesn't matter now. Go.

964
01:51:07,954 --> 01:51:09,751
Fire!

965
01:51:19,365 --> 01:51:21,299
Get that door!

966
01:51:28,374 --> 01:51:29,398
Trapped.

967
01:51:44,824 --> 01:51:45,756
Charge them!

968
01:51:45,825 --> 01:51:47,417
Spare their lives, if you can.

969
01:52:29,602 --> 01:52:31,968
Cowards! Twenty men run from four?

970
01:52:32,038 --> 01:52:36,134
The corridor nullifies our number.
No one wants to fight the captain.

971
01:53:00,633 --> 01:53:01,759
Charge!

972
01:53:24,990 --> 01:53:29,450
l am not angry with you. l knew you
would lead me to them, and so you have.

973
01:53:30,529 --> 01:53:34,192
Lay down your sword and
l will not punish you.

974
01:53:34,266 --> 01:53:35,733
l will let you retire in peace.

975
01:53:36,836 --> 01:53:40,272
And l will give your
friends a swift execution...

976
01:53:40,339 --> 01:53:42,273
if you surrender now.

977
01:53:47,609 --> 01:53:49,509
Perhaps you should take his offer.

978
01:53:52,247 --> 01:53:54,613
We're dead anyway.

979
01:53:54,683 --> 01:53:56,378
He's right.

980
01:54:00,355 --> 01:54:01,287
Wait.

981
01:54:01,356 --> 01:54:04,052
Bargain me to Louis for all your lives.

982
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:06,487
You've done your best.

983
01:54:06,561 --> 01:54:08,358
Please, let me go.

984
01:54:17,105 --> 01:54:19,039
l cannot do it.

985
01:54:21,209 --> 01:54:23,143
Even if l could give up my king...

986
01:54:26,615 --> 01:54:29,413
l could never give up...

987
01:54:29,484 --> 01:54:30,917
my son.

988
01:54:42,164 --> 01:54:43,995
Your son?

989
01:54:44,066 --> 01:54:46,057
l loved your mother.

990
01:54:47,336 --> 01:54:49,270
l love her still.

991
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:53,407
You are my son.

992
01:54:59,815 --> 01:55:01,806
l never knew you existed.

993
01:55:02,851 --> 01:55:04,478
And l never...

994
01:55:04,553 --> 01:55:07,181
felt pride as a father...

995
01:55:10,993 --> 01:55:12,858
until this moment.

996
01:55:39,688 --> 01:55:42,156
They're young Musketeers.

997
01:55:42,224 --> 01:55:44,886
They've been weaned on our legends.

998
01:55:46,228 --> 01:55:47,957
They revere us.

999
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:49,895
lt is an advantage.

1000
01:55:49,965 --> 01:55:52,866
Yes. Why don't we charge them?

1001
01:55:54,036 --> 01:55:55,697
l trained these men.

1002
01:55:55,771 --> 01:55:58,535
They will fight to the death.

1003
01:56:00,142 --> 01:56:02,201
But if we must die-

1004
01:56:02,277 --> 01:56:05,110
lf we must die...

1005
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:06,511
let it be like this.

1006
01:56:14,623 --> 01:56:17,353
One for all. All for one.

1007
01:56:45,287 --> 01:56:46,151
Shoot.

1008
01:56:48,557 --> 01:56:50,821
Magnificent valor.

1009
01:56:52,861 --> 01:56:53,850
Shoot them.

1010
01:56:55,730 --> 01:56:56,492
Fire!

1011
01:59:01,890 --> 01:59:02,857
Get off me!

1012
01:59:10,932 --> 01:59:13,765
He is your brother.

1013
01:59:16,304 --> 01:59:17,999
Brother?

1014
01:59:23,311 --> 01:59:26,246
Outside. All of you.
You're sworn to silence.

1015
01:59:30,185 --> 01:59:32,278
Get this off me.

1016
01:59:44,633 --> 01:59:46,328
Forgive me.

1017
01:59:50,238 --> 01:59:51,728
All my life-

1018
01:59:55,010 --> 01:59:57,171
This-

1019
01:59:57,245 --> 01:59:59,645
This is the death...

1020
01:59:59,714 --> 02:00:02,012
l have always wanted.

1021
02:00:04,886 --> 02:00:06,581
All for one.

1022
02:00:06,655 --> 02:00:08,623
One for-

1023
02:00:17,232 --> 02:00:19,962
You were the one in the mask.

1024
02:00:57,038 --> 02:00:59,404
All my life...

1025
02:00:59,474 --> 02:01:01,806
all l ever wanted to be...

1026
02:01:03,278 --> 02:01:05,212
was him.

1027
02:01:14,895 --> 02:01:16,829
We have recaptured the prisoner.

1028
02:01:16,897 --> 02:01:18,057
No, l am the-

1029
02:01:22,536 --> 02:01:26,438
You will put this madman where
no one can hear his insanity.

1030
02:01:26,507 --> 02:01:29,135
Let him be fed by a deaf mute...

1031
02:01:29,209 --> 02:01:31,643
but feed him well.

1032
02:01:31,712 --> 02:01:35,580
And let him find redemption in wearing
the pains he has placed on others.

1033
02:01:36,717 --> 02:01:37,979
Take him.

1034
02:01:44,892 --> 02:01:47,360
And them?

1035
02:01:54,134 --> 02:01:57,160
They are my royal council
and truest friends.

1036
02:02:57,364 --> 02:02:59,594
He was the best of us all.

1037
02:03:24,725 --> 02:03:28,593
After all you have done, l
must ask you one more service.

1038
02:03:28,662 --> 02:03:31,927
Let me love you like a son to a father.

1039
02:03:31,999 --> 02:03:34,490
And, l pray you, live for this:

1040
02:03:36,703 --> 02:03:38,637
To love me like your son.

1041
02:03:58,592 --> 02:04:00,753
Musketeers!

1042
02:04:00,828 --> 02:04:02,261
Salute!

1043
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:09,066
One for all. All for one.

1044
02:04:22,249 --> 02:04:24,911
The prisoner in the iron
mask was never found.

1045
02:04:26,386 --> 02:04:30,550
lt was whispered among his jailers
that he received a royal pardon...

1046
02:04:30,624 --> 02:04:33,491
and was taken to the country
where he lived quietly...

1047
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:36,688
visited often by the queen.

1048
02:04:36,763 --> 02:04:39,493
The king known as Louis XlV...

1049
02:04:39,566 --> 02:04:44,196
brought his people food,
prosperity and peace...

1050
02:04:45,405 --> 02:04:48,499
and is remembered as
the greatest ruler...

1051
02:04:48,575 --> 02:04:51,237
in the history of his nation.
