Well, most of the time,
Dr Lecter didn't respond at all to visitors.

18

He'd just, for instance,

I chose. I shot her.

155
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,494
I killed a mother holding her child.

156
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,040
And I regret it, I resent myself for it.

157
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,626
All right, gentlemen,
I'm going to call a halt to this meeting

158
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,587
and get back to you individually by phone.

159
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,757
(MEN SCOFFING)

160
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,510
Waste of time.

161
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,514
PEARSALL: You have
a secret admirer, Starling.

162
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:12,518
Isn't much to look at,
but he does have friends in high places.

163
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,187
Remember Mason Verger?

164
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:20,526
CLARICE: Lecter's fourth victim,
the rich one.

165
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,737
The only one that survived.

166
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:27,116
He says he has some new information
on Lecter. He'll only share it with you.

167
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,910
CLARICE: What do you mean,
only share it with me? You want it, seize it.

168
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:31,954
We'd rather not.

169
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,622
CLARICE: I wasn't speaking to you,
Mr Krendler.

170
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,042
When I speak to you,
you'll know it, because I'll look at you.

171
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,462
Why would we rather not?

172
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,798
The last time he called was when we
took Lecter off the Ten Most Wanted list.

173
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,053
He was upset about that.
We said, "Hey, that's life."

174
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:50,264
He said, "Hey, this is
a Senate oversight committee,

175
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,266
"to make your life miserable."

176
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,729
His family's political contributions
may not be enough to buy a senator,

177
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,565
but they are enough to rent them
from time to time.

178
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:03,986
There's no reason to go through that again
if he really does have something new.

179
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:09,950
KRENDLER: It's a good deal for you,
Starling. You can't pretend it isn't.

180
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,369
You get to go back on a celebrated case.

181
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:16,165
I'll take care of the media
for your Drumgo killing.

182
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,376
- Everyone's gonna be happy.
- I'm not happy.

183
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,506
Well, maybe you're incapable
of being happy.

184
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,469
Mr Krendler, when you're out on the street,

185
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,596
you know you might take
a bullet in the line of duty.

186
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,016
You accept it, or you get out.
You live with it.

187
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,770
What you don't expect, or accept,

188
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,272
is taking one in the back in your boss' office

189
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,775
for doing your job
exactly as they've taught you.

190
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,027
That makes you unhappy.

191
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:49,573
Of course, you're right, Starling,
but it doesn't really change anything.

192
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,243
It changes everything. It changes me.

193
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,464
Agent Starling, hi. I'm Cordell Doemling,
Mr Verger's private physician.

194
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:48,674
CLARICE: How do you do?

195
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,886
If you'd be so kind
as to park down at the end.

196
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,311
One's eyes adjust to the darkness.

197
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,693
MAN ON TV: ...versus an estimate of 16.

198
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,528
Dylan, they're saying sales
have slowed down.

199
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,781
Seems like a recurring theme here. Perhaps
corporate spending on a slowdown...

200
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,287
CORDELL: Mr Verger, Agent Starling is here.

201
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,290
Good morning, Mr Verger.

202
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,627
VERGER: Was that a Mustang
I heard out there?

203
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,170
Yes, it was.

204
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,172
- A five litre?
- Yes.

205
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,591
Fast.

206
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,428
Cordell, I think you can leave us now.

207
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,972
I thought I might stay.

208
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,476
- Perhaps I could be useful.
- You could be useful

209
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,020
seeing about my lunch.

210
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,151
I'd like to attach this microphone

211
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,487
to your clothing or your pillow,
if you're comfortable with that.

212
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,239
Oh, by all means.

213
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,372
VERGER: Here, this should make it easier.

214
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:14,718
You know, I thank God for what happened.
It was my salvation.

215
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,181
Have you accepted Jesus, Agent Starling?

216
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,434
- Do you have faith?
- I was raised Lutheran.

217
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,145
That's not what I asked.

218
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,649
This is Special Agent Clarice Starling,
5-1-4-3-6-9-0,

219
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,318
deposing Mason R. Verger
on March 20, sworn and attested...

220
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:32,945
- I wanna tell you about summer camp.
- Mr Verger...

221
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,614
- It was a wonderful childhood experience.
- We can get to that later.

222
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,409
No, we can get to it now.

223
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:41,036
You see, it all comes to bear.

224
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,665
It was a Christian camp my father founded

225
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,837
for poor, unfortunate,
castoff little boys and girls

226
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,673
who would do anything for a candy bar.

227
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,050
Mr Verger, I don't need to know
about the sex offences,

228
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,510
- I just have to...
- No, it's all right.

229
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,804
I have immunity from the U.S. Attorneys,

230
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:02,683
and I have immunity from the Risen Jesus.

231
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,228
And nobody beats the Riz.

232
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,647
Had you ever seen Dr Lecter

233
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,858
before the court assigned you to him
for therapy?

234
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,652
What do you mean? Socially?

235
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,529
(LAUGHING)

236
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,741
That is what I mean.
Yes, if you don't mind talking about it.

237
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,660
- Oh, not at all. I'm not ashamed.
- I didn't say you should be.

238
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:25,914
No. We met conventionally,
as doctor and patient.

239
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,836
- How did he end up at your house?
- I invited him, of course.

240
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,506
To my pied-à-terre.

241
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:39,762
I came to the door
in my nicest "come hither" outfit.

242
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:44,308
I was concerned he'd be afraid of me,

243
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,603
but he didn't seem to be afraid of me.

244
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,398
That's almost funny now.

245
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:52,775
(LAUGHING)

246
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:57,780
I showed him my toys,
my noose setup, among other things.

247
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:02,159
It's a way you sort of hang yourself,
but not really.

248
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,370
It feels good while you...

249
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,081
Well, you know.

250
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,793
Anyway, he said, "Mason..."

251
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,337
Mason, would you like a popper?

252
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:20,427
And I said, "Would l? Oh, wow."
Once that kicked in, I was flying.

253
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,059
He said, "Mason, show me how you smile
to gain the confidence of a child."

Then I smiled.

256
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:34,817
He said, "Oh, I see how you do it."

257
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:38,487
The good doctor approached me
with a piece of broken mirror.

258
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,572
"Try this."

259
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,242
Try peeling off your face.

260
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,370
"And feeding it to the dogs."

264
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,426
LECTER: Try again.

265
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,011
No, I'm afraid not.

266
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,682
VERGER: (LAUGHING) That's entertainment!

267
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,562
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

268
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:17,359
Mr Verger, you indicated to me that you'd
received some kind of new information.

269
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:19,736
Um...

270
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:20,988
Cordell.

271
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:41,133
- Where did this come from?
- Buenos Aires. I received it two weeks ago.

272
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:47,139
- Where is the package it came in?
- Good question.

273
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:52,436
There was nothing written on it of interest.
Cordell, did we throw it out?

274
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,607
- Yes, I'm afraid we did.
- Oh, dear. You think it'll help?

275
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:01,987
I hope so. I hope it'll help you catch him,

276
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,616
to help cleanse the stigma
of your recent dishonour.

277
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:11,246
- Thank you. I think that's all I need.
- Did you find some rapport with Dr Lecter,

278
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,499
in your talks at the asylum?

279
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,419
I know I did, while I was peeling.

280
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,714
We exchanged information in a civil way.

281
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:24,384
- But always through the glass?
- Yes.

282

(INHALES DEEPLY)

283
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,565
- Isn't it funny?
- What's that?

284
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,693
You can look at my face,

but you shied when I said the name of God.

286
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:15,978
- Finding what you want?
- Are you sure this is all of it?

287
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,564
That's all there is now. There was more,

288
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:22,317
but it's been picked over
little by little over the years.

289

You know, this stuff's worth
a lot of money in certain circles.

that disappears around here,

Hey, Barney. Remember me?

296
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,335
Would you agree for the record,
Agent Starling,

297
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,879
that I've not been read my rights?

298
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:13,095
I have not Mirandized Barney.
He is unaware of his rights.

299
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,350
So, when you turned Dr Lecter over
to the Tennessee police...

300
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:22,020
They weren't civil to him.
They're all dead now.

301
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,856
Yeah, they only survived his company
three days.

302
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:27,859
You survived him six years at the asylum.

303
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:31,363
How'd you do that?
It wasn't just being civil.

304
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,407
Yes, it was.

305
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:36,326
Did you ever think after he escaped
he might come after you?

306
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:42,999
No. He once told me that whenever feasible,
he preferred to eat the rude.

307
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:46,002
(CHUCKLES) "Free-range rude,"
he called them.

308
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:48,880
What about you?
You ever think he might come after you?

309
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,507
You ever think about him at all?

310
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:54,094
Oh, at least 30 seconds of every day.
I can't help it.

311
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,847
He's always with me, like a bad habit.

312
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,352
Do you know what happened to his stuff?
His books, papers, drawings...

313
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:06,148
Everything got thrown away
when the place closed. Cutbacks.

314
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:10,569
Barney, I just found out that Dr Lecter's
signed copy of The Joy of Cooking

315
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:13,864
sold to a private collector for $16,000.

316
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,323
Phew!

317
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,367
It was probably a fake.

318
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:21,663
The seller's affidavit of ownership
was signed Karen Phlox.

319
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:23,165
Do you know Karen Phlox?

320
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,083
You should.

321
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:29,629
She filled out your employment application,
only at the bottom, she signed it "Barney."

You want the book? Maybe I can get it back.

324
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:41,266
I want the X-ray they shot
after you broke Lecter's arm

325
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,643
during the attack on that nurse.

326
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,896
And everything else you got.

327
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,778
We used to talk about
a lot of things at night,

328
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:56,198
after the screaming finally died down.

329
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,245
We talked about you sometimes.

330
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,124
- You wanna know what he said?
- Go get the X-ray.

331
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:16,301
- I'm not a bad guy.
- I didn't say you were.

332
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,929
Dr Chilton was a bad guy.

333
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,430
After your first visit,

334
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:23,850

Go on, now. You've grieved long enough.

338
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:43,745
And what'd he say?

339
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:47,123
What'd he say about me, late at night?

340
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:51,336
Well, he was talking about inherited,
hard-wired behaviour.

341
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,589
He was using genetics
in the roller pigeons as an example.

342
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:55,966
They fly way up in the air,

You can't breed two deep rollers,

346

or their young, their offspring,
will roll all the way down, hit, and die.

it's because I like to look at you

I want a window where I can see a tree,
or even water.

I want to be in a federal institution,

Gentlemen, you have examined him
in medieval Italian,

and I will not deny
that his language is admirable

for a straniero, but

00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:41,154
is he acquainted with the personalities

I think not.

What if he came upon a note
in the Capponi Library,

say, from Guido de Cavalcanti?

I would think.

I have followed with enthusiasm

428
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:55,325
the course of your disgrace
and public shaming.

429

My own never bothered me,

430
00:33:56,869 --> 00:34:00,079
except for the inconvenience
of being incarcerated,

431
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:02,373
but you may lack perspective.

432

In our discussions down in the dungeon,

433
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:10,006
it was apparent to me that your father,

figures largely in your value system.

I think your success in putting an end
to Jame Gumb's career as a couturier

436
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,102
pleased you most because you could
imagine your father being pleased.

you're in bad odour with the FBI.

Do you imagine your daddy being shamed
by your disgrace?

00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:34,697
Do you see him in his plain pine box
crushed by your failure?

440
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,659
The sorry, petty end of a promising career?

441
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,913
What is worst
about this humiliation, Clarice?

442
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:45,792
Is it how your failure
will reflect on your mommy and daddy?

443
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:51,422
Is your worst fear that people will now
and forever believe they were, indeed,

00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:55,343
just good old trailer-camp,

Mmm?

447

By the way, I couldn't help noticing
on the FBI's rather dull public website,

448
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:09,232
that I have been hoisted from the Bureau's
archives of the common criminal,

Where he was when he wrote it,
is what I need.

466
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:26,142
Well, the paper isn't gonna help.

467

And, yes, it's linen fibre,
yes, it's on the expensive side,

468

well, you can check it out,

it came from a re-mailing service.

What the hell you doing
sitting there in the dark, Starling?

Because of his avarice,

Pier Della Vigna was disgraced,
blinded and imprisoned.

Dante's pilgrim finds Pier Della Vigna
on the seventh level of the Inferno.

Like Judas Iscariot, he died by hanging.

824

So Judas and Pier Della Vigna
are linked, in Dante,

825
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:29,034
by the avarice he saw in them.

826
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:33,456

are linked in the medieval mind.

The reason we're doing it like this, Clarice,
is because I like to watch you as we speak,

1083
01:34:28,664 --> 01:34:30,998
with your eyes open.

1084
01:34:31,083 --> 01:34:34,210
No, it does not excite me, it pleases me.

1085
01:34:35,295 --> 01:34:37,421
You have very shapely feet.

1086
01:34:40,676 --> 01:34:43,302
Where are we now? Call it out.

1087
01:34:44,137 --> 01:34:46,430
- Massachusetts Avenue.
- Take it.

1088
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:51,352
I thought, to begin with,
you might tell me how you're feeling.

1089
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:52,520
About what?

1090
01:34:52,604 --> 01:34:55,189
The masters you serve,
and how they've treated you.

1091
01:34:55,274 --> 01:34:57,149
Your career, such as it is.

1092
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:00,069

1093
01:35:00,153 --> 01:35:02,071

1094
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:05,366
- What's the next cross street?
- Capitol Street.

1095
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:09,370

into Union Station. Park.

1096
01:35:10,706 --> 01:35:13,040
My life? What is there to say about mine?

1097
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:16,127
I have been in a state of hibernation
for some time.

1098
01:35:16,962 --> 01:35:20,381
A little inactive, but now I'm back home,

1099
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:22,925
I'm very happy and very healthy.

1100
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,847
- You, though, it's you I'm worried about.
- I'm fine.

1101
01:35:28,807 --> 01:35:31,058
No, you're certainly not fine, Clarice.

1102
01:35:31,143 --> 01:35:33,853
You fell in love with the Bureau,
the institution,

1103
01:35:33,937 --> 01:35:37,273
only to discover,
after giving it everything you've got,

1104
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:39,567
that it does not love you back.

1105
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:41,527
That, in fact, it resents you.

1106
01:35:41,612 --> 01:35:45,031
Resents you more than the husband
and children you gave up to it.

1107
01:35:45,115 --> 01:35:46,699
Why is that, do you think?

1108
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:49,827
- Why are you so resented, Clarice?
- Tell me.

1109
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:54,665
Tell you? God bless you. Well, isn't it clear?

1110
01:35:57,169 --> 01:35:59,795
You serve the idea of order, Clarice,

1111
01:36:00,547 --> 01:36:01,756
they don't.

1112
01:36:02,007 --> 01:36:05,676
You believe in the oath you took, they don't.

1113
01:36:05,761 --> 01:36:09,430
You feel it is your duty
to protect the sheep, they don't.

1114
01:36:09,932 --> 01:36:12,141
They don't like you
because you're not like them.

1115
01:36:12,225 --> 01:36:14,560
They hate you and they envy you.

1116
01:36:14,645 --> 01:36:17,730
They're weak and unruly,
and believe in nothing.

1117
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:21,108
Mason Verger wants to kill you, Dr Lecter.

1118
01:36:21,193 --> 01:36:23,778
Turn yourself in to me,
and I promise no one will hurt you.

1119
01:36:23,862 --> 01:36:27,657
Will you stay with me in my prison cell
and hold my hand, Clarice?

1120
01:36:27,741 --> 01:36:29,867
We could have some fun.

1121
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:33,496
No, Mason Verger does not want to kill me,
any more than I want to kill him.

1122
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:37,625
He just wants to see me suffer
in some unimaginable way.

1123
01:36:37,709 --> 01:36:39,585
He is rather twisted, you know.

1124
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:42,088
- Have you had the pleasure of meeting him?
- I have.

1125
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:45,257
- Face to face, so to speak?
- Yes.

1126

- Attractive, isn't he?
- Dr Lecter?

1127
01:36:50,973 --> 01:36:52,515
Dr Lecter?

1128
01:36:54,226 --> 01:36:58,646
Okay, back to you. I want to know
what it is you think you will do,

1129
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,481
now that everything in the world
you've ever cared about

1130
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:04,151
- has been taken away from you.
- I don't know, Dr Lecter.

1131
01:37:04,236 --> 01:37:07,488
Tell me, Clarice, do you think you'll work
as a chambermaid

1132
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:10,241
at a motel on Route 66,

1133
01:37:10,325 --> 01:37:12,159

1134
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:14,161

LECTER: What are you thinking now?

1138
01:37:24,631 --> 01:37:28,300
Are you paying attention to me,
ex-Special Agent Starling?

1139
01:37:29,302 --> 01:37:32,930
Are you, by any chance,
trying to trace my whereabouts?

1140
01:37:36,977 --> 01:37:40,146
- I'm being followed, Dr Lecter.
- I know, I've seen them.

1141
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:43,065
And now you're in a real dilemma,
aren't you?

1142
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:47,028
Do you continue to try to find me,
knowing that you're leading them to me?

1143
01:37:47,112 --> 01:37:49,572
Do you have so much faith
in your abilities, Clarice,

1144
01:37:49,656 --> 01:37:52,700
that you honestly believe you could
somehow simultaneously

1145
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:54,702
arrest me and them?

1146
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:58,706
It could get very messy, Clarice,
like the fish market.

1147
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,374
- Hey, Clarice.
- Yeah?

1148
01:38:00,459 --> 01:38:03,044
- What if I did it for you?
- Did what?

1149
01:38:03,128 --> 01:38:06,881
Harmed them, Clarice.
The ones who have harmed you.

1150
01:38:06,965 --> 01:38:09,967
What if I made them scream apologies?

1151
01:38:10,052 --> 01:38:11,761
No, I shouldn't even say it,

1152
01:38:11,845 --> 01:38:15,639
because you'll feel,
with your perfect grasp of right and wrong,

1153
01:38:15,724 --> 01:38:18,059
that you were somehow accompli.

1154
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:22,980
- Don't help me.
- No. Of course not.

Yeah, warmer again.

with you, and the clues.

If you can't be polite to our guests,
you have to sit at the kiddies' table.

Don't get up, Clarice.
Paul will help me clear and make the coffee.

02:02:46,860 --> 02:02:48,402
would you ever say to me,

"Stop. If you loved me, you'd stop"?
