1
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:50,135
The war for freedom continues

2
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:53,765
whilst heroic deeds are done
throughout our territory.

3
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:59,482
Our magnificent loyalist militia
have expelled the fascists from Madrid.

4
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,520
The defeated totalitarians head north
with the aid of the enemies of freedom:

5
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:08,055
the Italian fascists and German Nazis,

6
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:11,225
aiming to attack
the impenetrable North Democratic Belt.

7
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:15,392
From the Basque Country barricades,
tireless militia will defend democracy,

8
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:17,812
prepared to sweat blood.

9
00:02:18,058 --> 00:02:20,598
A frightened Franco
seeks help from Hitler

10
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:24,097
and his Condor Legion,
led by Von Richthofen,

11
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:26,227
cousin of the Red Baron himself.

12
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:33,177
To stop them, the Soviet Union has sent
their bravest to fight for democracy

13
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:38,310
on the battlefield
with a message of death to the fascists.

14
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,680
We will not allow fascist fallacies
to poison our spirit.

15
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:48,983
We won the battle in Madrid.
We shall win!

16
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:51,183
Really?

17
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:56,022
I despise propaganda, pal.

18
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:58,388
I don't care who's slingin' it.

19
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,475
Comrade,

20
00:03:06,558 --> 00:03:08,308
may I have a swig?

21
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:10,392
<i>- Sovietski?
- Da.</i>

22
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:14,602
Can't share it, pal.

23
00:03:15,308 --> 00:03:18,268
Cough syrup. Sore throat, see?

24
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:20,272
American.

25
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:22,228
It is not your war.

26
00:03:24,392 --> 00:03:25,602
Right.

27
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:29,265
But I'm still here, anyway.

28
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:25,425
Hello?

29
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,557
Hello, Francois, how are you?

30
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,732
Good, good.
Just arrived a couple of days ago.

31
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:31,888
Yes, getting in touch with the city.

32
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:35,055
You know,
you can't see a single soldier here.

33
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:38,227
No. I'm sure. I'm sure.

34
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:42,432
Yes. No tanks, no weapons.

35
00:04:42,558 --> 00:04:45,388
<i>They're all in the border
trying to defend here, but...</i>

36
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:46,733
<i>Yes, somebody told me. Yes...</i>

37
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:49,058
Francois?

38
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:52,557
Hello?

39
00:04:57,017 --> 00:05:00,517
Hey, what are you doing?
I was transmitting my article.

40
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:02,432
I work for a French newspaper.

41
00:05:02,558 --> 00:05:04,308
You know the rules.

42
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:08,888
If you tell your paper
we're losing the war, we cut you off.

43
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:12,058
It's better than canceling your permit

44
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:14,515
or arresting you, which we can also do.

45
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:16,058
Please...

46
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:19,892
- I'm just trying to do my job.
- So am I.

47
00:05:20,975 --> 00:05:25,015
Carmen, I want a copy of his articles
one hour before transmission.

48
00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:39,272
It's the first time
he's been sent as a journalist.

49
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:42,098
How are you feeling?

50
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:44,518
You don't look too good.

51
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,520
I didn't sleep well.

52
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:49,768
I've a lot on my mind.

53
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,312
Vasyl is waiting for you in his office.
Go on.

54
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:06,387
Good morning.

55
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:09,388
Teresa. How are you?

56
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:10,475
Good.

57
00:06:10,558 --> 00:06:11,728
One moment.

58
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:15,675
This is for you.

59
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:17,305
No. You shouldn't.

60
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,057
Well, I missed you. Come.

61
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:22,433
How was Madrid?

62
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:24,227
Well, dangerous.

63
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:26,308
And I'm glad to be here.

64
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:27,932
They're beautiful.

65
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:30,477
Beauty attracts beauty.

66
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,727
I forgot one more thing.

67
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,890
Here you go.

68
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:43,058
- Too heavy for chocolates, huh?
- It is.

69
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,480
Vasyl...

70
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:53,767
Do you like it?

71
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:55,765
Thank you.

72
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:20,517
You'll pay for it.
Hit him, hit him.

73
00:07:29,558 --> 00:07:31,058
- What's going on?
- He'll be hanged.

74
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:33,683
- He's lucky if that's all.
- His plane was shot down.

75
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,480
He's one of the German bomber pilots.

76
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:51,135
Hey, don't you dare!

77
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:11,055
Hey, Marta.

78
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:14,805
Hey, Henry.
I've been waiting for you outside.

79
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:19,483
So, now you're drunk.

80
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:21,602
Not drunk enough.

81
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,850
Come on. Let's go.

82
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:30,225
Wait, sir!
Wait! Do you want an apple?

83
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,100
Sure.

84
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:36,475
There you go.

85
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,888
Thank you!

86
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,060
Take a tip. Never eat the local food.

87
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:45,767
Come on. It takes an hour
to get to the front.

88
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,890
Now, wait a minute, because...

89
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:50,885
What do we want
to go to the battlefield for, anyway?

90
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:53,768
I got a better idea. Look. Look.

91
00:08:58,392 --> 00:08:59,892
This morning's troop movements.

92
00:08:59,975 --> 00:09:01,475
Where did you get that map?

93
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:03,517
I drew it.

94
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:04,767
You drew it?

95
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:08,888
I figure we'd just,
you know, add a few details, like...

96
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,563
- What?
- My name.

97
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:13,892
In big letters.

98
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:15,615
And we take a nice photo of it. You know?

99
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,312
There, in front of those sandbags.

100
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,523
Henry...

101
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:24,392
What kind of journalist
have you turned into?

102
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:26,477
A wise one.

103
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:31,055
Henry!

104
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,230
Hey...

105
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:36,347
Are you really going to
lie to your paper like that?

106
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:38,232
No. Not a lie.

107
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:39,728
It's the truth.

108
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:41,427
I've seen war, Marta.

109
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:43,977
I know the truth of war,
and I know how to tell it.

110
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,060
So, the truth is whatever
I choose to write.

111
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,890
Now...

112
00:09:48,975 --> 00:09:50,345
- Cheese.
- No.

113
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:52,312
You know you adore me. Come on.

114
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:15,563
Guess who has tickets
to the Bach concert next weekend?

115
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:17,725
It's me.

116
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,560
I pulled strings.

117
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,640
- I would love to go.
- Good.

118
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,305
Bach is wonderful.

119
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:25,142
Although I prefer Shostakovich.

120
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,482
But now the Soviets have
sent him to prison.

121
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:29,598
Yes, but you know,
I don't support these methods.

122
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:31,733
But I can tease you, can't I?

123
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:33,888
Of course.

124
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:37,425
Teresa,

125
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:40,558
if you and I were together again, I...

126
00:10:40,642 --> 00:10:41,982
Vasyl, I...

127
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,725
Look here, from the Danish reporter.

128
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:47,228
She was trying to smuggle this out.

129
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,270
I'll deal with it.

130
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,770
Thank you.

131
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,930
Come on.

132
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,563
Poor people.

133
00:11:21,517 --> 00:11:24,387
Looks like fascists are winning positions.

134
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:36,845
They have snipers.
They've shot two of our men.

135
00:11:37,975 --> 00:11:39,265
We'll rescue them.

136
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:41,022
Those two guys are history.

137
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,475
This fog is impossible.

138
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:54,557
Marta. Get back here.

139
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,770
Look, when I was in Ethiopia,
my interpreter tried to do something brave.

140
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:02,142
The newspaper turned its back on him.

141
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:05,308
He's in prison now.
They won't even pay for his lawyer.

142
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,562
What the hell do you wanna
risk your life for?

143
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,270
Make the newspaper owners even richer?

144
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,767
Take the picture
that will turn the world around.

145
00:12:15,683 --> 00:12:16,813
Marta, no! Come back here!

146
00:12:17,058 --> 00:12:18,058
Come back here!

147
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Are you out of your mind?

148
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Marta!

149
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,312
Don't do that!
It's dangerous!

150
00:12:25,392 --> 00:12:27,232
Well, what about her?
She can't stay out there!

151
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:28,433
Marta!

152
00:12:34,892 --> 00:12:36,272
Marta, don't!

153
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:45,725
Help me.

154
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,810
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

155
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:50,062
Please.

156
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,475
Help!

157
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,177
Do something.

158
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:14,228
Marta!

159
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:15,982
Marta, leave it!

160
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,890
Go! Now!

161
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:41,784
What the hell were you thinking?

162
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:43,598
I don't know. What were you thinking?

163
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,733
That picture is important.
Publish it.

164
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,640
I put some brandy in it.

165
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:18,062
Thank you.

166
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:23,137
Please. Eat.

167
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:25,385
Thank you so much.

168
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:31,892
Pretty good, huh?

169
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:40,928
<i>- You don't want anything?
- Nyet.</i>

170
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,070
Why don't you
become a fashion photographer?

171
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:50,892
Or sports?

172
00:15:51,642 --> 00:15:53,352
I want my Capa.

173
00:15:53,392 --> 00:15:55,232
Robert Capa is overrated.

174
00:15:55,558 --> 00:15:57,138
Hemingway, too, isn't he?

175
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:59,478
Everybody is overrated, but not you.

176
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:00,933
I didn't say that.

177
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:03,887
You've had your glory moments.
Now leave room for us.

178
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:11,888
That was close.

179
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:13,143
German?

180
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:23,102
It's coming back.

181
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,890
Go!

182
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:33,103
The papers! The camera!

183
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:34,183
No, wait!

184
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:49,517
Shit.

185
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,560
- You okay?
- Yeah.

186
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:57,515
Stupid picture!

187
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:35,267
Something like that.

188
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,480
Hey, Henry.

189
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,518
Marco.

190
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:43,022
I wondered when you'd show up.

191
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:44,728
Like a bad penny.

192
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:46,518
Yes.

193
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,523
I heard your car was bombed.

194
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:54,478
But I thought it was you
telling your usual stories, but now...

195
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:58,558
And I heard that you've been
secretly writing articles for the fascists.

196
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:01,055
Yes.

197
00:18:02,142 --> 00:18:04,272
It's dangerous
when you cross the lines, Marco.

198
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:07,018
You get yourself shot.

199
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:10,425
If you write what they want,
you never get shot.

200
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:19,225
Didn't know you were here.

201
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:20,557
Hey, Marta.

202
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:25,888
I'm so glad to see you again.

203
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:27,183
Glad to see you, too.

204
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:33,852
George!

205
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:36,142
How's New York?

206
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:37,675
Where is my check?

207
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:40,515
<i>Henry, we have
cheaper journalists, you know.</i>

208
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:42,728
Yeah, but none of them
is named Henry Howell.

209
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:45,307
<i>They'll have names of their own
if I give them a chance.</i>

210
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:50,182
<i>Listen, child star Shirley Temple
released a toy collection with her face.</i>

211
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:51,925
<i>And all the papers opened with that.</i>

212
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:53,909
<i>- There's a war on, Henry...
- All right. Here's what we can do.</i>

213
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:58,393
I've got a hand-drawn battle map.
Make a great illustration. But...

214
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:00,812
Speaking of illustrations,

215
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,100
how about a week in Paris, George?

216
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:07,103
Picasso is preparing a new exhibition.

217
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:08,768
Let's do Picasso.

218
00:19:08,892 --> 00:19:10,482
Together.

219
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:12,557
He'll talk to me, you know.

220
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,310
<i>Nothing about Paris.</i>

221
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:17,062
<i>Bergara. Do you remember that article?</i>

222
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:19,182
<i>That's war. And war sells, Henry.</i>

223
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,845
<i>I want war! I...</i>

224
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:06,562
Absolute perfection.

225
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:15,892
Come in.

226
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,850
Teresa?

227
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,100
These are the new journalists.

228
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:25,392
Marco Navas.
He works for a Portuguese newspaper.

229
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,683
And these two are the ones
with the car that broke down.

230
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:30,925
No, it didn't break down. It was bombed.

231
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:33,927
<i>Marta Vonier, photographer from Le Figaro.</i>

232
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:38,057
<i>And Henry Howell,
from the New York Herald Tribune.American.</i>

233
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:40,678
I studied your writing at college. I...

234
00:20:41,017 --> 00:20:42,847
I think I've read it all.

235
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:45,312
Short. Sharp.

236
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:47,058
Very inspiring.

237
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:50,562
Your style has evolved
over time, hasn't it?

238
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:54,642
Well, I'm still a growing boy.

239
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,098
I just read this article
of yours about Bergara.

240
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:03,227
You write of a battle at a castle

241
00:21:03,308 --> 00:21:07,478
where our soldiers
were firing from the battlements.

242
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,312
I think it was a pretty good piece.

243
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:16,683
It's quite interesting
because there are no castles in Bergara.

244
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:19,725
Why? Why did you write it?

245
00:21:20,142 --> 00:21:22,392
Is it even about the truth anymore?

246
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:27,812
Well, maybe I
got the name of the town wrong.

247
00:21:28,183 --> 00:21:29,603
There's so many.

248
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:31,517
Don't play with us.

249
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:35,385
For you, it's a story.
But for us, it's life and death.

250
00:21:35,517 --> 00:21:37,767
Obey the rules, Mr. Howell.

251
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:40,848
They're simple enough even for you.

252
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:43,478
I'm sorry. You are?

253
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,057
We've got a question.

254
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,980
We lost everything in the explosion.

255
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:57,598
So, we need new papers.

256
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,177
We will let you know your status.

257
00:22:00,225 --> 00:22:01,725
And you have to wait.

258
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:04,892
In the meantime, we can provide you
with a camera and some films,

259
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:06,853
so you can continue your work.

260
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:11,062
But the freedom of movement
is restricted in this area.

261
00:22:11,308 --> 00:22:12,638
Stay away from the border.

262
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:14,808
So, please...

263
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,057
Thank you.

264
00:22:18,725 --> 00:22:20,595
Here it is.

265
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:24,932
That's all we have.

266
00:22:47,392 --> 00:22:49,352
Gentlemen, your results!

267
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:52,893
Thomas is first with 16 hits,
Matthias is second with 12

268
00:22:53,017 --> 00:22:55,227
and Wolfgang is third with 9.

269
00:22:55,433 --> 00:23:00,143
So this week's bonus is for Thomas Selber.

270
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:03,305
Are you saving up
for the wedding or a house?

271
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:06,597
No, I came here to buy this truck.

272
00:23:06,892 --> 00:23:10,522
- These Spanish girls would be cheaper.
- Attention!

273
00:23:16,225 --> 00:23:18,595
Lieutenant Colonel Von Richthofen!

274
00:23:18,892 --> 00:23:20,272
Stand to attention!

275
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:27,887
Discipline.
Gentlemen, discipline!

276
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,558
We have lost men through pilot error.

277
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:38,183
One was saved by his parachute,
but he was taken to Bilbao.

278
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,980
Two others died in a car accident

279
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,230
coming back
from one of those parties.

280
00:23:47,017 --> 00:23:48,517
Don't forget,

281
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,310
we lost the Great War

282
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:55,773
but today might be our second chance.

283
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,055
Don't take it too hard.

284
00:24:05,642 --> 00:24:07,982
Well, she's just doing her job.

285
00:24:08,725 --> 00:24:10,265
I'm just doing mine.

286
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:11,728
Yeah.

287
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,557
This old piece of junk.

288
00:24:14,725 --> 00:24:16,725
I can't work with this.

289
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:19,347
Are you crossing the lines again?

290
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:21,142
Don't you need a photographer?

291
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,060
Are you offering yourself
to the fascists, Marta?

292
00:24:30,392 --> 00:24:31,732
Or to me?

293
00:24:31,808 --> 00:24:34,268
Hey, you're American?

294
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:35,483
Yes.

295
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,677
They sold me a car. It's not good.

296
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:40,975
All Yanks know how to fix cars, don't you?

297
00:24:42,392 --> 00:24:44,062
I don't do auto repair.

298
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:48,307
Okay.

299
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:50,142
Thank you.

300
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:53,312
<i>- Hey!
- Si?</i>

301
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,562
- Does anyone know how to fix a car?
- Yes.

302
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:13,178
He gets under your skin, this Mr. Howell?

303
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:15,558
No, not really.

304
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:17,733
I suppose he's charismatic.

305
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:18,848
Well,

306
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:21,433
this is undeniable.

307
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:25,182
But is he on our side?

308
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:27,135
He's on nobody's side.

309
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,390
Look, he made a mistake.

310
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:33,975
But he can still be useful to us
with Americans.

311
00:25:34,892 --> 00:25:37,602
Americans don't care about anything.

312
00:25:37,975 --> 00:25:39,555
Don't forget.

313
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:53,887
Here you are, Mr. Howell.

314
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,683
Thank you, Nicolie.

315
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:04,225
Henry! Henry?

316
00:26:05,225 --> 00:26:06,975
Pierre.

317
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:08,478
Pierre.

318
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:10,728
- Still in the white suits.
- Yes.

319
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:12,847
When was the last time?

320
00:26:12,892 --> 00:26:15,772
- Chaco War, '32.
- Yes.

321
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,058
How is Spain looking to you?

322
00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:20,233
It's worse.

323
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:22,098
Exactly.

324
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:23,773
It's fantastic for us.

325
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,060
Great.

326
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,480
I'm told we can get the best photographs.

327
00:26:27,892 --> 00:26:29,982
Would you excuse me?

328
00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:32,233
Who is that?

329
00:26:34,017 --> 00:26:36,557
A literary genius, so called.

330
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,770
Wrote a book about some Negro soldiers
who fought in France in The Great War.

331
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,390
The Harlem Hellfighters?

332
00:26:43,808 --> 00:26:46,098
Is that the famous Henry Howell?

333
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,640
Room service.

334
00:26:59,642 --> 00:27:01,392
Marta?

335
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:09,602
Look, I've been asking around,

336
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,770
and I found you a Leica.

337
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,560
It's going to do what you're looking for.
It's got a real high-speed lens on it.

338
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:19,982
It'll get you a Capa.

339
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,885
Marta?

340
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:37,977
Do you think he heard us?

341
00:27:47,517 --> 00:27:51,887
Vasyl. The Consul is waiting for you
in your office.

342
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:58,477
Take the profiles of the journalists.

343
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:04,387
I didn't expect you, Mr. Consul.

344
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:08,805
We will return these files.

345
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,890
Might I have a moment
to discuss something of a personal nature?

346
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,595
Are you referring to your brother?

347
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:15,975
Yes, sir.

348
00:28:18,725 --> 00:28:20,015
Come.

349
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:27,230
Your brother will find that Siberia
becomes more gentle at this time of year.

350
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:28,638
He's a poet.

351
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:30,451
Poets sometimes write things
they're sorry for.

352
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,925
Comrade Stalin has not forgotten
that you were with the Trotskyites,

353
00:28:34,017 --> 00:28:37,477
and that you publicly
expressed your remorse. But Nikolai...

354
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:39,928
No. Please, sir. Wait, wait.

355
00:28:40,892 --> 00:28:43,352
Nikolai doesn't deserve this.

356
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:46,728
- Do you want to solve this?
- Yes.

357
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:52,725
Perhaps you could bring me
an enemy of the revolution.

358
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:54,677
Find this person,

359
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:57,765
and I will find a crime to fit him with.

360
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,022
Thank you very much.

361
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,520
Mr. Howell.

362
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:31,138
Hi, MarÃ­a.

363
00:29:31,892 --> 00:29:34,142
Look, I...

364
00:29:34,225 --> 00:29:38,015
I need to get something out of the country
without the censors seeing it.

365
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:41,023
I heard you could fix that.

366
00:29:41,058 --> 00:29:44,308
Sure... But it is expensive.

367
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:47,563
Okay. So, charge it to Marco's room.

368
00:29:47,975 --> 00:29:49,295
And prepare my bags for checkout.

369
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:50,642
Are you leaving?

370
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,730
Paris.

371
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:55,478
- You are not staying for the tour?
- Tour?

372
00:29:55,683 --> 00:29:56,933
Yes, the Press Office tour.

373
00:29:57,225 --> 00:29:59,885
No, I'm not staying for
the Press Office tour.

374
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:02,353
Hey, Henry.

375
00:30:03,142 --> 00:30:04,392
Are you running away again?

376
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:07,098
Come on!

377
00:30:07,225 --> 00:30:08,675
They're buying us lunch.

378
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:09,885
Come on.

379
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,017
Don't worry.
I have the right connections.

380
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:15,888
- I should give it to you now? Or...
- Yes.

381
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:20,597
Mr. Howell, are you sending
some of your fiction to New York?

382
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:25,393
No, no. It's a birthday card. Grandmother.

383
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:28,392
Fancy a little sightseeing?

384
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:29,773
I...

385
00:30:32,017 --> 00:30:35,387
Please. You will be our star guest.

386
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:39,805
I'm on my knees.

387
00:30:59,017 --> 00:31:00,017
What is he doing here?

388
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,225
Calm down. I invited him.

389
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:03,637
I don't trust him.

390
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:07,885
These people work for newspapers that sell
millions of copies all over the world.

391
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,183
We should look after them.

392
00:31:09,225 --> 00:31:10,305
No.

393
00:31:10,392 --> 00:31:12,812
Please, Vasyl. I know how to do my job.

394
00:31:13,392 --> 00:31:14,784
Please come with me. My brother, he's...

395
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:18,388
I thought the great Communist Party
was obsessed with schedules.

396
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:20,055
We wouldn't wanna be late.

397
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:23,767
Let's talk later.

398
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:25,768
Thank you.

399
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:34,057
- Where's the journalist from Madrid?
- No idea, he's always late.

400
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,432
Let's go.

401
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,562
You have one hour to take photos.

402
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,890
Enjoy the food, the views,

403
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:15,563
and write nice things about us
if you can, okay?

404
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,602
If somebody wants to go to the top,
there are 241 steps.

405
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,810
Good luck. The views are amazing.

406
00:32:22,892 --> 00:32:24,522
We meet back at the bus.

407
00:32:39,642 --> 00:32:40,892
I'll come up shortly.

408
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,020
Are you coming up?

409
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:52,772
Absolutely beautiful.

410
00:32:53,892 --> 00:32:55,232
Yes, it is.

411
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:00,228
You wanna start over?

412
00:33:01,225 --> 00:33:02,425
Why not?

413
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,850
Bit early.

414
00:33:08,225 --> 00:33:09,635
More for me.

415
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:14,058
All right. You just live once.

416
00:33:15,142 --> 00:33:16,272
There you go.

417
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:26,182
So, what's your life's story?

418
00:33:27,308 --> 00:33:29,228
I wanted to be a writer.

419
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,060
But when the war happened,

420
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,980
the loyalists needed people
who spoke languages,

421
00:33:35,642 --> 00:33:37,892
and knew how to deal with journalists.

422
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,272
So you're dealing with me?

423
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,930
Well, in my way.

424
00:33:43,017 --> 00:33:46,057
And because you didn't become a writer,

425
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,270
you deal in editing what
other people write.

426
00:33:48,392 --> 00:33:52,732
Well, circumstances delimit one's choices,
don't they?

427
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:58,267
To be honest, I'm like you.

428
00:33:59,517 --> 00:34:01,597
I don't fit in many places.

429
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:07,518
You're a Communist?

430
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
Loyalist.

431
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:11,983
I wish to see a democracy for Spain.

432
00:34:34,392 --> 00:34:38,182
- Morning, my Lieutenant Colonel.
- Good morning, Wolfgang.

433
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:41,095
Berlin wants
better air and land coordination.

434
00:34:41,558 --> 00:34:44,598
With the Spanish?
Impossible.

435
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,730
The engine is fine but check piston two.

436
00:34:49,517 --> 00:34:52,387
The Spanish aren't the only ones,
Wolfgang.

437
00:34:52,475 --> 00:34:56,385
The Italians are pretty much the same.

438
00:34:56,475 --> 00:34:58,635
We learn something new every day.

439
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:03,598
Meanwhile our men are holding out
against syphilis and diarrhea.

440
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:09,098
Minister Garring wants to bomb a city
as a birthday present to Hitler.

441
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:11,563
Fine.
It's a nice present for our Fuhrer.

442
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,932
He will see
what the German Air Force is capable of.

443
00:35:16,225 --> 00:35:19,055
Hey, what's that? Revolutionary pin?

444
00:35:19,558 --> 00:35:20,558
No.

445
00:35:21,558 --> 00:35:25,888
It's a football pin. Athletic club.

446
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:27,933
From Bilbao, my city.

447
00:35:29,267 --> 00:35:32,887
I wear it because my father gave it to me
when he played for them.

448
00:35:33,725 --> 00:35:35,475
What's he do now?

449
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,890
He passed away.

450
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,930
I'm sorry.

451
00:35:47,017 --> 00:35:48,677
You must miss him.

452
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,600
Yes. Yes, I do.

453
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:58,095
I wasn't a daughter that he hoped for.

454
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:02,353
He arranged my marriage to a family friend,

455
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:04,932
and I ran away.

456
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:16,098
Here, in this country, a lot of people believe
that women can't have their own opinions.

457
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,270
Come on.

458
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,230
Everybody to the bus, please.

459
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,430
Let's go.

460
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,062
<i>Next up, a government hospital.</i>

461
00:36:28,142 --> 00:36:31,682
Supplies are generously provided
by the Soviet Union.

462
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,180
You have to talk to your paper. I mean it.

463
00:36:55,892 --> 00:36:57,772
- Hello.
- Hello.

464
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:03,103
Hi.

465
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,523
Your cow needs a tail.

466
00:37:11,892 --> 00:37:13,352
How did this happen?

467
00:37:14,475 --> 00:37:16,095
Was it from the fighting?

468
00:37:17,892 --> 00:37:20,432
Better story for you if I said yes, huh?

469
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:26,390
I'll get the truth for you,
but the real truth is on her face,

470
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:28,733
no matter what happened to her.

471
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:31,227
She needs your help.

472
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,930
Marta, please.

473
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,388
Thank you.

474
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:53,385
No. The government is dead
but behaves as if it isn't.

475
00:37:54,725 --> 00:37:57,095
The Basque front is about to collapse.

476
00:37:59,642 --> 00:38:04,102
The thing is, the retreat may come
right through my position here in Bilbao,

477
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:05,643
by Gernika. So...

478
00:38:08,558 --> 00:38:09,598
Shit!

479
00:38:09,892 --> 00:38:11,932
- What?
- You know the rules.

480
00:38:12,017 --> 00:38:14,887
- You are all such cynics.
- You have something for me?

481
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:16,225
Yeah.

482
00:38:16,267 --> 00:38:20,557
- You'd better go home, it's late.
- Right away. See you tomorrow.

483
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,350
We have a report
that a journalist has been in Burgos

484
00:38:25,392 --> 00:38:27,062
and now moves freely in our area.

485
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:28,892
- Name?
- Not yet.

486
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:30,233
Not acceptable.

487
00:39:35,725 --> 00:39:37,225
It isn't good?

488
00:39:39,683 --> 00:39:42,643
No, it's shit.

489
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:45,272
Dig deeper.

490
00:39:50,017 --> 00:39:51,637
My young lady found it.

491
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:54,392
Bookstore. Just on the street.

492
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,352
Antique bookstore, but...

493
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,810
You want me to sign it?

494
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:02,063
Keep it.

495
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,980
In fact, read it.

496
00:41:23,892 --> 00:41:27,232
This is a Tree of Gernika.

497
00:41:27,308 --> 00:41:29,978
An ancient symbol of Basque identity.

498
00:41:30,517 --> 00:41:35,387
Oak trees symbolized traditional freedoms
for Bizcayans and for the Basque people.

499
00:41:35,475 --> 00:41:39,765
Many centuries ago, under this tree,
laws were enacted,

500
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:43,680
prohibiting torture and arresting people
without court approval.

501
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:47,557
You have five minutes to take photos, okay?
We'll meet back at the bus.

502
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:56,392
This is off the record,

503
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:58,893
but do you wanna taste
the real Basque country?

504
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,765
Wonderful...

505
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,560
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

506
00:42:04,642 --> 00:42:06,732
Teresa, where are you going?

507
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:09,428
I'm gonna take them somewhere.

508
00:42:09,517 --> 00:42:11,201
Can you wait for me
in the front door, please?

509
00:42:11,225 --> 00:42:12,345
Sure.

510
00:42:12,392 --> 00:42:14,022
Give me a second.

511
00:42:15,142 --> 00:42:17,232
They must stay with the group.

512
00:42:18,225 --> 00:42:20,885
And you'd better be careful.

513
00:42:21,267 --> 00:42:22,557
I owe you one.

514
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:41,852
Why are you here?

515
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,390
You know you're not welcome.

516
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,560
Go away!

517
00:42:46,642 --> 00:42:48,732
Are you driving us out?
You?

518
00:42:50,558 --> 00:42:51,728
When my son returns,

519
00:42:52,017 --> 00:42:54,057
you'll be the one to be driven out!

520
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:59,230
We all know which side your son fights on.
On the fascists' side!

521
00:42:59,725 --> 00:43:00,805
Leave it!

522
00:43:01,058 --> 00:43:03,348
I won't sell you anything.
No beetroots,

523
00:43:03,558 --> 00:43:05,058
no leeks, no carrots,

524
00:43:05,225 --> 00:43:06,595
no cauliflowers.
Nothing!

525
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:09,427
You'll change your mind
when ours come along,

526
00:43:09,933 --> 00:43:11,183
when it's too late!

527
00:43:11,517 --> 00:43:13,097
- Are you sure?
- Come on.

528
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,140
What's all that about then?

529
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:23,925
Well, she supports the other side.

530
00:43:24,058 --> 00:43:26,348
Here, everybody knows
everything about everyone.

531
00:43:26,392 --> 00:43:27,732
Yeah?

532
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:45,143
We are 35 kilometers away from the front.

533
00:43:46,392 --> 00:43:48,682
It's about to break.

534
00:43:48,975 --> 00:43:52,925
The Spanish have asked us
to attack with full force.

535
00:43:54,058 --> 00:43:57,728
They will retreat through the mountains,
along that road.

536
00:43:57,975 --> 00:43:59,555
Franco wants to stop them here.

537
00:43:59,975 --> 00:44:03,845
He'd better make sure we get the ammo
and the fuel we were promised.

538
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,233
They must make sure our bills are paid.

539
00:44:07,392 --> 00:44:09,732
I've spoken with General Mola.

540
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:14,310
He wants us to bomb
all of the Basque factories.

541
00:44:14,558 --> 00:44:16,728
Really?
His own factories?

542
00:44:17,058 --> 00:44:19,518
The Spanish don't think about the future.

543
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:22,930
Soon there will be no tomorrow for them.

544
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:39,062
What is going on?

545
00:44:41,475 --> 00:44:46,225
We stopped his car.
He was about to cross enemy lines.

546
00:44:47,558 --> 00:44:50,428
I took the wrong road.

547
00:44:50,517 --> 00:44:52,597
They pulled out all the traffic signs.

548
00:44:53,975 --> 00:44:55,135
Are you a spy?

549
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,555
No!

550
00:44:57,392 --> 00:45:01,182
No, for God's sake, I don't know the area.

551
00:45:01,225 --> 00:45:03,055
I just...

552
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,390
I just wanted to meet
with the journalist tour.

553
00:45:06,933 --> 00:45:09,023
Vasyl, I'm watching you.

554
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,390
Show me what you can do.

555
00:45:13,517 --> 00:45:14,677
Please.

556
00:45:15,558 --> 00:45:17,388
Please, sir. I have two children.

557
00:45:18,642 --> 00:45:20,182
Have mercy.

558
00:45:22,558 --> 00:45:23,928
Have mercy.

559
00:45:46,642 --> 00:45:50,142
Teresa!
What a joy!

560
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,140
It's been so long.

561
00:45:58,683 --> 00:46:00,143
This is Begoña, my mother's sister.

562
00:46:00,517 --> 00:46:02,887
The Coloma family isn't as stuck up
as my father's one.

563
00:46:03,225 --> 00:46:04,425
Nice girl!

564
00:46:05,558 --> 00:46:08,138
This is Henry, Marco and Marta.

565
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:11,060
- Foreign reporters.
- Welcome.

566
00:46:11,933 --> 00:46:14,183
Look at you, you look exhausted.

567
00:46:14,308 --> 00:46:15,728
Auntie...

568
00:46:16,225 --> 00:46:17,425
She doesn't sleep.

569
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,638
- She's too sensitive for this job.
- Stop it.

570
00:46:21,017 --> 00:46:22,887
It's none of their business.

571
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,060
Answering back,
just like she did with her father.

572
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,020
She said that when Teresa was a
little girl, she was pretty feisty.

573
00:46:30,683 --> 00:46:32,063
Yeah, I bet she was.

574
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:33,267
Teresa!

575
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,230
Isabel.

576
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,230
What a surprise!

577
00:46:41,183 --> 00:46:42,183
You look lovely.

578
00:46:43,225 --> 00:46:44,555
This is my cousin, Isabel.

579
00:46:47,058 --> 00:46:50,098
What a joy!
Just in time to see my wedding dress.

580
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,390
Yes.

581
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,978
She's so excited. She's getting married.

582
00:46:54,308 --> 00:46:55,478
Congratulations.

583
00:46:55,808 --> 00:46:58,598
- What did he say?
- Congratulations.

584
00:47:00,058 --> 00:47:01,228
Thank you.

585
00:47:01,517 --> 00:47:03,057
May I take a picture of you?

586
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:04,387
A photograph.

587
00:47:04,725 --> 00:47:06,225
- Yes.
- Yes?

588
00:47:12,225 --> 00:47:15,925
That's uncle's car.
It's always broken down.

589
00:47:16,017 --> 00:47:19,597
- That's my uncle's car. It never works.
- Really?

590
00:47:19,683 --> 00:47:22,483
Well, maybe we can help out.

591
00:47:22,808 --> 00:47:24,058
Come on, Marco.

592
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,430
I'll show you my dress.

593
00:47:25,517 --> 00:47:29,267
Automobile repair?
I thought you didn't do automobile repair.

594
00:47:29,475 --> 00:47:30,635
Hello?

595
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:34,265
Can we give you a hand?

596
00:47:34,392 --> 00:47:36,732
- American?
- Yes, American.

597
00:47:36,933 --> 00:47:38,563
If you want to buy me a new car.

598
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:39,890
Not good...

599
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:42,201
You wanna get in the car,
get ready to start it up?

600
00:47:42,225 --> 00:47:45,595
It's the carburetor.
It wouldn't happen with a Spanish car.

601
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:50,100
Bad times for everyone.
We're better here than in the city.

602
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:53,350
We grow vegetables
and exchange things with neighbors.

603
00:47:53,558 --> 00:47:55,098
But in Bilbao...

604
00:47:56,142 --> 00:47:58,142
All right. Crank it.

605
00:47:59,392 --> 00:48:01,812
No. Wait. Hold on.

606
00:48:03,058 --> 00:48:05,388
We need it,
our daughter is getting married

607
00:48:05,558 --> 00:48:07,558
and we'll have to visit her.

608
00:48:08,017 --> 00:48:10,727
Or if we have to leave here in a hurry.

609
00:48:12,517 --> 00:48:15,677
Is it better to send Begoña
and my daughter to Bilbao?

610
00:48:16,058 --> 00:48:18,518
If I were you,
I'd leave as soon as possible.

611
00:48:20,017 --> 00:48:21,017
Yeah, okay.

612
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:22,390
Give it another go.

613
00:48:24,808 --> 00:48:26,228
Yes!

614
00:48:51,892 --> 00:48:53,232
God, help me!

615
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:21,390
Why?

616
00:49:24,058 --> 00:49:26,098
Why do you insist on breaking the rules?

617
00:49:27,767 --> 00:49:31,137
Life is so much easier if you just listen.

618
00:49:31,725 --> 00:49:33,135
Please don't do it.

619
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:36,268
I'm innocent.

620
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,683
I'm innocent.

621
00:49:43,183 --> 00:49:44,683
I've never shot a man.

622
00:50:25,017 --> 00:50:26,137
Thank you.

623
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:28,392
Thank you.

624
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:44,728
Makes me angry
to have to do your work, Mikiavich.

625
00:50:45,892 --> 00:50:48,852
I asked you to bring me
an enemy of the people,

626
00:50:48,892 --> 00:50:51,392
and all I get is this fascist pig.

627
00:50:52,892 --> 00:50:56,062
And I have to do it all by myself.

628
00:50:56,975 --> 00:50:58,425
- I understand.
- No!

629
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:01,558
Clearly you do not.

630
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:04,393
In Moscow, the party denounces
someone every day.

631
00:51:04,475 --> 00:51:05,475
Why?

632
00:51:05,558 --> 00:51:09,348
Because it keeps the proletariat in line.

633
00:51:09,392 --> 00:51:12,232
You have to do it better, Mikiavich.

634
00:51:12,392 --> 00:51:15,062
Bring me an enemy of the revolution,

635
00:51:15,142 --> 00:51:17,142
or some big prize

636
00:51:17,225 --> 00:51:23,055
and then we can continue
this most enlightening conversation.

637
00:52:27,225 --> 00:52:29,345
It's Teresa, as a child.

638
00:52:29,433 --> 00:52:31,063
That's Teresa?

639
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,230
Her father, a football player.

640
00:52:34,267 --> 00:52:38,477
Football!
Ferocious, like Teresa.

641
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:45,230
My cousin wants to know the opinion
of a famous writer about her dress.

642
00:52:49,392 --> 00:52:50,682
Do you like it?

643
00:52:51,142 --> 00:52:52,142
I don't know why...

644
00:52:52,225 --> 00:52:53,555
I drew it myself.

645
00:52:53,642 --> 00:52:54,682
Yeah, I...

646
00:52:54,725 --> 00:52:56,345
It's at the dressmaker's.

647
00:52:57,392 --> 00:53:00,062
My boyfriend hasn't seen it yet,
he's at the front.

648
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:01,770
I wanted a man's opinion.

649
00:53:03,892 --> 00:53:06,102
Well, I think it's...

650
00:53:07,308 --> 00:53:08,928
Very pretty.

651
00:53:10,058 --> 00:53:11,558
Really?
Do you think it's pretty?

652
00:53:11,642 --> 00:53:12,642
Yeah, sure.

653
00:53:12,808 --> 00:53:14,428
Very, very pretty.

654
00:53:16,725 --> 00:53:18,225
Guess I said something right.

655
00:53:18,517 --> 00:53:21,177
Come on.
Lunch is ready!

656
00:53:21,433 --> 00:53:22,433
Lunch.

657
00:53:23,392 --> 00:53:26,182
Yes, we agree to the plan.

658
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:32,480
Please,
inform Franco that after the operation

659
00:53:32,558 --> 00:53:35,478
he must advance quickly to Bilbao

660
00:53:35,558 --> 00:53:38,678
or he will miss a golden opportunity.

661
00:53:39,058 --> 00:53:41,728
The General always advances slowly,

662
00:53:41,808 --> 00:53:44,848
he prefers to shoot his enemies
house by house.

663
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:48,887
Yes, but delays cost money.

664
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,887
There's no Republican aviation
in the area.

665
00:53:52,017 --> 00:53:55,557
They only have one plane in Bilbao
and it's being repaired.

666
00:53:56,058 --> 00:53:57,348
Splendid.

667
00:54:00,475 --> 00:54:02,975
- Where's the ten of hearts?
- Here you are.

668
00:54:03,058 --> 00:54:04,848
No, it hasn't come up.

669
00:54:04,892 --> 00:54:06,022
Thank you.

670
00:54:07,058 --> 00:54:08,558
Fold a card.

671
00:54:09,058 --> 00:54:10,098
Perhaps she has it.

672
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,640
It's magic.

673
00:54:14,142 --> 00:54:15,892
No.

674
00:54:18,183 --> 00:54:19,893
You are a big cheat.

675
00:54:20,892 --> 00:54:22,522
You two are in it together.

676
00:54:22,808 --> 00:54:23,808
He's a big cheater.

677
00:54:23,892 --> 00:54:24,892
A toast!

678
00:54:24,933 --> 00:54:25,933
Cheers.

679
00:54:26,017 --> 00:54:28,307
For the magician!
American, cheers!

680
00:54:35,558 --> 00:54:38,268
Uncle will play a song.
I hope you like it.

681
00:54:38,558 --> 00:54:42,768
- Yes!
- We can dance, if someone teaches me.

682
00:54:46,183 --> 00:54:48,353
- Can I?
- Yes.

683
00:54:54,058 --> 00:54:55,138
Let's see.

684
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:58,230
- I've no idea.
- It's very easy.

685
00:55:10,892 --> 00:55:12,142
You want to dance?

686
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:14,927
Come on. You can't...

687
00:55:18,225 --> 00:55:20,345
You know, I'm actually a very good dancer.

688
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,230
Start like this?

689
00:55:23,475 --> 00:55:24,725
Is that one of ours?

690
00:55:25,558 --> 00:55:26,558
No.

691
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:28,725
It's German.

692
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:30,392
German.

693
00:55:31,517 --> 00:55:32,677
Let's go inside.

694
00:55:36,225 --> 00:55:37,975
- Isabel!
- Isabel!

695
00:55:41,558 --> 00:55:43,228
Go, go!

696
00:55:46,017 --> 00:55:47,057
You see.

697
00:56:36,558 --> 00:56:37,728
Let me be clear.

698
00:56:39,975 --> 00:56:41,845
Okay, I'm not sure I believe this.

699
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:45,887
You invite journalist to your family home,

700
00:56:45,933 --> 00:56:49,563
and then the American...
He tries to send this?

701
00:56:50,392 --> 00:56:52,142
- Maybe he was...
- Don't lie to...

702
00:56:53,558 --> 00:56:55,888
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't lie to me.

703
00:56:56,683 --> 00:56:58,353
- As I was...
- Just...

704
00:56:58,433 --> 00:57:00,483
- What's happening to you?
- Just go, okay?

705
00:57:00,558 --> 00:57:02,308
Just go!

706
00:57:26,017 --> 00:57:27,057
Please, come in.

707
00:57:29,558 --> 00:57:32,228
I'm sorry, Mr. Howell,
but I cannot authorize this.

708
00:57:33,475 --> 00:57:34,475
I'm sorry?

709
00:57:34,683 --> 00:57:37,103
It says the Republic has lost its morale.

710
00:57:39,058 --> 00:57:41,638
You criticized the hospital,
and what about the burned girl?

711
00:57:42,558 --> 00:57:44,348
You gave her too little space.

712
00:57:45,225 --> 00:57:46,985
Well, the article isn't
about a burned girl.

713
00:57:47,475 --> 00:57:50,555
It's about the horrors of war,
and the people trapped in the middle of it.

714
00:57:51,308 --> 00:57:52,848
Well, we are not demoralized.

715
00:57:56,975 --> 00:57:58,385
It is true what they say.

716
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:02,847
They use a pretty face
to push me to tell the truth.

717
00:58:03,558 --> 00:58:06,728
But what you really mean is
you want me to push your propaganda.

718
00:58:06,808 --> 00:58:08,978
You know, this whole office is a story!

719
00:58:09,225 --> 00:58:10,925
I should send a photo of you to New York.

720
00:58:11,058 --> 00:58:12,348
You're not sending anything.

721
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,060
I'll handle this, Teresa.

722
00:58:16,475 --> 00:58:19,225
I am not some Italian journalist, you know.

723
00:58:19,475 --> 00:58:21,265
<i>I'm the New York Herald Tribune.</i>

724
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:24,060
I know exactly who you are, Mr. Howell.

725
00:58:25,225 --> 00:58:26,555
What's that supposed to mean?

726
00:58:28,725 --> 00:58:30,555
Why don't you come to Russia?

727
00:58:31,892 --> 00:58:34,352
You will be a hero of the revolution,

728
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:38,015
as soon as you put a sheet of paper
in a typewriter.

729
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:43,728
In your dreams, comrade.

730
00:58:45,183 --> 00:58:46,933
Don't play tough guy with me.

731
00:58:48,933 --> 00:58:51,733
We know you left your
interpreter in Ethiopia.

732
00:58:53,058 --> 00:58:56,138
The Italians, they came to your hotel,
and then what?

733
00:58:56,892 --> 00:58:57,892
Tell me.

734
00:58:59,225 --> 00:59:00,515
You ran away.

735
00:59:06,975 --> 00:59:07,975
No!

736
00:59:32,475 --> 00:59:33,725
Gentlemen,

737
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,270
thermite!

738
00:59:41,808 --> 00:59:45,728
In just a few seconds, it reaches 1,000Â°C

739
00:59:46,058 --> 00:59:49,058
and melts anything
it comes into contact with.

740
00:59:50,892 --> 00:59:52,732
During the 8 minutes it burns,

741
00:59:52,767 --> 00:59:56,267
it can't be put out with water nor sand.

742
00:59:56,725 --> 01:00:00,845
First, we shall bomb
their water supply systems,

743
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:03,980
so they cannot put out any fire.

744
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:07,232
Then we'll incinerate
everything with thermite.

745
01:00:07,392 --> 01:00:09,602
German efficiency at its best:

746
01:00:09,683 --> 01:00:12,983
minimum intervention,
maximum destruction!

747
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:19,480
Meeting someone?

748
01:01:20,308 --> 01:01:21,308
No.

749
01:01:21,767 --> 01:01:24,557
Good. I need something translated.

750
01:01:24,892 --> 01:01:26,392
I'm afraid you'll have to stay.

751
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:28,885
It can't wait until tomorrow morning?

752
01:01:34,225 --> 01:01:35,225
No.

753
01:02:34,558 --> 01:02:35,728
Tired?

754
01:02:36,225 --> 01:02:39,885
I have some pages left,
but I can't read any word.

755
01:02:40,308 --> 01:02:41,518
I'm exhausted.

756
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:47,100
There's a reception at City Hall
tomorrow night.

757
01:02:48,558 --> 01:02:49,888
Will you come with me?

758
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:51,892
I'll be glad to.

759
01:03:42,558 --> 01:03:43,678
No, thank you.

760
01:03:45,933 --> 01:03:47,023
Thank you.

761
01:03:56,183 --> 01:03:57,683
I'm sorry I couldn't meet you.

762
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,015
Vasyl kept me working until very late.

763
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:03,640
I think he knew.

764
01:04:07,183 --> 01:04:08,233
Is that all?

765
01:04:09,517 --> 01:04:11,727
You're hurt because I
censored your article.

766
01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:13,659
Well, you were the one
who wanted me to write the damn thing.

767
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,393
Well, I had no option. I'm sorry.

768
01:04:16,767 --> 01:04:18,307
You don't understand.

769
01:04:19,933 --> 01:04:20,933
Right.

770
01:04:21,392 --> 01:04:23,562
Henry, I did love your article.

771
01:04:24,058 --> 01:04:26,388
You must keep writing
with the same feeling.

772
01:04:27,558 --> 01:04:29,228
What you are doing is important.

773
01:04:29,267 --> 01:04:31,177
Not just for Spain, but for you.

774
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,390
How is it important for Spain
if no one gets to read it?

775
01:04:34,475 --> 01:04:35,725
We'll find a way.

776
01:04:40,058 --> 01:04:43,558
Maybe it doesn't make sense,
but I was inspired by your writing.

777
01:04:52,808 --> 01:04:53,888
Let's dance.

778
01:04:59,933 --> 01:05:00,933
What's on your mind?

779
01:05:02,392 --> 01:05:04,142
I don't know, Marta. I...

780
01:05:04,892 --> 01:05:09,312
I don't know how to explain in English,
but, you know, this war...

781
01:05:09,725 --> 01:05:10,845
I know this war.

782
01:05:10,892 --> 01:05:13,232
- You know...
- Yeah, but tonight's a party...

783
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,560
Communique from your Consul.

784
01:05:27,975 --> 01:05:28,975
Just now.

785
01:05:31,392 --> 01:05:33,392
He says, "Do you have someone for me yet?"

786
01:05:33,558 --> 01:05:35,308
He wants to make an example of someone.

787
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,850
He doesn't care who.

788
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,890
No. He does.

789
01:05:51,892 --> 01:05:54,232
You know I suppose I actually should
thank you.

790
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,640
I really liked writing that article.

791
01:05:58,392 --> 01:05:59,432
I liked it a lot.

792
01:06:00,975 --> 01:06:03,265
I need to get back to that sort of writing,
and I will.

793
01:06:04,475 --> 01:06:06,225
But perhaps not in Spain.

794
01:06:08,017 --> 01:06:09,097
Are you leaving?

795
01:06:11,017 --> 01:06:12,097
Of course you are.

796
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,270
Teresa.

797
01:06:22,017 --> 01:06:24,347
We both want the same thing, Henry.

798
01:06:25,683 --> 01:06:28,063
The problem is, one of us is not free.

799
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:49,850
Teresa.

800
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:51,850
Teresa.

801
01:06:53,517 --> 01:06:54,637
It's late.

802
01:06:55,725 --> 01:06:57,885
There's a foreign delegation
coming tomorrow.

803
01:06:58,183 --> 01:07:00,393
I'm sorry, Vasyl, but tomorrow is tomorrow.

804
01:07:14,725 --> 01:07:16,345
Welcome to my hiding place.

805
01:07:36,767 --> 01:07:39,307
This place reminds me
of why I do what I do.

806
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:51,270
Here, we preserve art
and beauty from the war.

807
01:08:20,725 --> 01:08:22,765
This place is so emotional for me.

808
01:09:49,267 --> 01:09:50,387
Wait.

809
01:09:56,558 --> 01:09:58,978
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

810
01:10:00,642 --> 01:10:01,642
Please.

811
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,890
Come with me to Paris.

812
01:10:36,642 --> 01:10:37,852
Good morning, everybody.

813
01:10:40,142 --> 01:10:41,312
Carmen.

814
01:10:41,975 --> 01:10:43,826
Do you think I can get a line
to New York, please?

815
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:44,930
Okay.

816
01:11:16,058 --> 01:11:19,268
Hold it!
Don't move! Hands up!

817
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:20,390
Your attention.

818
01:11:21,017 --> 01:11:25,057
An official stamp belonging to the
censor's office has been stolen.

819
01:11:25,142 --> 01:11:29,392
All shipment of articles will be suspended
until it is recovered.

820
01:11:29,475 --> 01:11:30,595
Search this room.

821
01:11:30,933 --> 01:11:32,393
What? Why?

822
01:11:35,558 --> 01:11:37,848
- Do you know something?
- No.

823
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,890
Hey, what are you doing?

824
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,100
This is your coat, Mr. Howell?

825
01:12:13,433 --> 01:12:15,393
APPROVED

826
01:12:24,558 --> 01:12:26,228
Who is the owner of this coat, huh?

827
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:31,017
Who?

828
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:34,733
It's mine.

829
01:12:41,058 --> 01:12:42,428
Look at the other pocket.

830
01:12:43,767 --> 01:12:44,767
It's my lipstick.

831
01:12:54,892 --> 01:12:55,982
What are you doing?

832
01:12:57,225 --> 01:13:00,845
The pin on the lapel, it's also mine.

833
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,560
You know that's my coat, Mikiavich.

834
01:13:12,225 --> 01:13:13,225
You know it's mine.

835
01:13:13,808 --> 01:13:15,388
- Teresa...
- I can handle it.

836
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,562
I'll be all right.

837
01:13:19,058 --> 01:13:20,308
You come with me.

838
01:13:21,225 --> 01:13:23,225
No. Where are you taking her?

839
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,270
You're wrong.

840
01:13:28,933 --> 01:13:32,563
This is not a game, Teresa.
Do you understand? Do you understand?

841
01:13:41,392 --> 01:13:44,312
The sacrifices we've made in Spain,

842
01:13:44,558 --> 01:13:47,388
the savings on ammunition and fuel

843
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,520
have not been in vain.

844
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:51,058
Blitzkrieg

845
01:13:51,892 --> 01:13:54,232
They've been talking about it
in Berlin for months.

846
01:13:54,308 --> 01:13:58,888
A three-day air raid
carried out in just one afternoon.

847
01:13:59,308 --> 01:14:00,848
As fast as lightning.

848
01:14:01,475 --> 01:14:05,055
We've received orders
to put it into practice

849
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,230
during our attack today.

850
01:14:07,808 --> 01:14:09,348
Therefore, gentlemen...

851
01:14:10,308 --> 01:14:12,308
enjoy your flight...

852
01:14:13,892 --> 01:14:14,892
to Gernika.

853
01:14:18,558 --> 01:14:19,558
Where is Teresa?

854
01:14:20,058 --> 01:14:21,888
I don't have that information.

855
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,270
You liar!

856
01:14:28,225 --> 01:14:31,015
What happens in her life
is no longer my business.

857
01:14:33,892 --> 01:14:37,022
Now get out. And take your coat.

858
01:14:41,433 --> 01:14:43,523
Get out.

859
01:14:53,558 --> 01:14:54,558
Carmen.

860
01:14:58,017 --> 01:14:59,017
Where is Teresa?

861
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:00,890
I don't know.

862
01:15:02,308 --> 01:15:03,388
How should I know?

863
01:15:04,808 --> 01:15:07,058
- You're her friend, aren't you?
- I don't know anything!

864
01:15:08,725 --> 01:15:10,925
Go away. Leave me alone.

865
01:15:11,475 --> 01:15:12,475
Please!

866
01:15:15,267 --> 01:15:16,267
Help me.

867
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:22,058
Don't you get it?

868
01:15:23,058 --> 01:15:27,268
For God's sake, leave.

869
01:15:28,933 --> 01:15:29,933
Please.

870
01:15:48,933 --> 01:15:49,933
Henry.

871
01:15:51,267 --> 01:15:52,267
Bad news.

872
01:15:52,725 --> 01:15:54,845
They found the body of
that Spanish journalist.

873
01:15:54,892 --> 01:15:56,892
My contacts say
Teresa didn't leave.

874
01:15:57,183 --> 01:15:58,393
She's in a cheka.

875
01:15:58,433 --> 01:15:59,813
- A what?
- Soviet prison.

876
01:16:00,225 --> 01:16:02,055
They use it to make their
enemies disappear.

877
01:16:02,142 --> 01:16:04,232
- It is in Gernika.
- Let's go.

878
01:16:18,808 --> 01:16:21,308
She was working right under your nose,
was she?

879
01:16:21,392 --> 01:16:24,102
Excellent work, Mikiavich.
Stalin will be pleased.

880
01:16:24,475 --> 01:16:27,265
- And?
- And what, Mikiavich?

881
01:16:28,558 --> 01:16:30,808
I delivered you an enemy of the people.

882
01:16:33,017 --> 01:16:35,387
My brother, Nikolai.

883
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:37,388
Unfortunately,

884
01:16:40,683 --> 01:16:41,683
too late.

885
01:16:43,058 --> 01:16:45,388
I will need your...

886
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:47,885
I will need your signature
on the death certificate.

887
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,930
Stalin does not forgive, Mikiavich.

888
01:16:51,892 --> 01:16:55,932
You continue your work,
or you will have to come back to Moscow,

889
01:16:56,017 --> 01:16:58,017
with some explanations.

890
01:17:07,892 --> 01:17:09,522
A magnificent day.

891
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:13,728
Ideal for a drive along the beach,
don't you think?

892
01:18:01,767 --> 01:18:03,097
Good luck, boys!

893
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:04,725
Everything will be OK!

894
01:18:08,933 --> 01:18:10,393
No.

895
01:18:11,058 --> 01:18:12,058
Please.

896
01:18:13,142 --> 01:18:16,062
- Can you stop this?
- We have to follow the orders.

897
01:18:21,392 --> 01:18:23,062
Take your clothes off!

898
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:26,640
- No.
- Undress!

899
01:18:28,808 --> 01:18:30,518
Vasyl, why are you doing this?

900
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:38,022
Vasyl!

901
01:18:52,683 --> 01:18:54,393
Have mercy, please!

902
01:19:43,767 --> 01:19:44,887
Out of the way!

903
01:20:28,308 --> 01:20:29,888
It's lovely, how much is it?

904
01:20:32,975 --> 01:20:36,175
- Yeah, this is the street. Don Tello Street.
- Don Tello, okay.

905
01:20:38,558 --> 01:20:39,728
Excuse me. Excuse me.

906
01:20:40,475 --> 01:20:41,925
Calle Don Tello?

907
01:20:42,725 --> 01:20:43,805
Marco, this way.

908
01:20:58,183 --> 01:20:59,983
Now, don't make this more difficult.

909
01:21:02,267 --> 01:21:03,267
Please.

910
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,890
Just sign it.

911
01:21:09,892 --> 01:21:12,852
"I, Teresa Azcotia,

912
01:21:14,017 --> 01:21:15,727
"confess that I'm a traitor,

913
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:22,765
"and that I sabotaged the revolution."

914
01:21:28,392 --> 01:21:29,482
Please.

915
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:33,180
Please. Please.

916
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:38,932
- This can't be happening.
- I'm sorry.

917
01:21:39,267 --> 01:21:43,477
- This can't be happening.
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

918
01:22:02,725 --> 01:22:04,055
You ask this woman.

919
01:22:04,642 --> 01:22:05,772
Excuse me, sir.

920
01:22:06,683 --> 01:22:09,063
I don't speak Spanish.
I need to find Calle Don Tello.

921
01:22:09,183 --> 01:22:10,733
You know what that is?

922
01:22:10,933 --> 01:22:13,063
We have to go to the shelter!
Come on!

923
01:22:13,642 --> 01:22:14,732
Henry, come on.

924
01:22:15,225 --> 01:22:16,515
Henry, come on!

925
01:22:16,725 --> 01:22:19,034
I'm gonna go this way.
I'll meet you here in an hour, okay?

926
01:22:19,058 --> 01:22:20,098
In an hour!

927
01:22:30,392 --> 01:22:32,312
Isabel!
Where are you going?

928
01:22:32,392 --> 01:22:33,432
To the tailor's!

929
01:22:33,517 --> 01:22:36,677
- Have you gone mad?
- My wedding dress!

930
01:22:36,767 --> 01:22:38,307
Come back!

931
01:22:38,767 --> 01:22:39,887
Isabel!

932
01:22:43,975 --> 01:22:47,725
Planes!
Get to the shelter! Come on!

933
01:22:47,892 --> 01:22:49,062
To the shelter!

934
01:22:50,725 --> 01:22:52,225
To the shelter!
Come on!

935
01:22:55,558 --> 01:22:56,768
Quickly!

936
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:07,770
Let's go to the bomb shelter.
Take him!

937
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:10,890
No, no, no!

938
01:23:34,767 --> 01:23:36,557
Come on!
Hurry up!

939
01:23:50,642 --> 01:23:53,272
To the bomb shelter!
Hurry up!

940
01:23:54,517 --> 01:23:55,677
Come on!

941
01:23:55,975 --> 01:23:57,345
To the City Hall!

942
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,850
To the shelter!
Come on!

943
01:24:02,058 --> 01:24:05,228
Leave that!
Go to the City Hall shelter.

944
01:24:05,475 --> 01:24:06,595
My car!

945
01:24:16,933 --> 01:24:18,103
Hurry up!

946
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:25,183
Marta, we have to go.

947
01:24:25,558 --> 01:24:26,638
Yeah.

948
01:24:27,058 --> 01:24:28,558
Okay. Wait, one second.

949
01:24:28,642 --> 01:24:31,732
One second. Okay... Okay.

950
01:24:49,433 --> 01:24:50,603
Isabel!

951
01:24:50,725 --> 01:24:52,118
I'm looking for your cousin, Teresa.

952
01:24:52,142 --> 01:24:53,201
- Henry...
- Calle Don Tello.

953
01:24:53,225 --> 01:24:54,885
- I need your help.
- Over there!

954
01:24:54,933 --> 01:24:55,933
This way?

955
01:25:00,933 --> 01:25:02,103
- No, Isabel.
- No.

956
01:25:02,183 --> 01:25:03,233
No, you can't!

957
01:25:03,267 --> 01:25:05,387
My dress!
It's my dress!

958
01:25:06,058 --> 01:25:07,558
Help me.

959
01:25:07,892 --> 01:25:09,232
Help, I've no strength!

960
01:25:20,225 --> 01:25:21,635
Are you okay? Are you okay?

961
01:25:32,267 --> 01:25:33,517
Teresa.

962
01:25:33,558 --> 01:25:36,928
- Isabel, you have to help me find Teresa.
- Teresa.

963
01:25:37,392 --> 01:25:38,392
Teresa!

964
01:25:39,058 --> 01:25:40,058
Teresa.

965
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:42,930
Teresa.
Yes, come on, let's go.

966
01:26:01,267 --> 01:26:03,057
Bastards!

967
01:26:03,392 --> 01:26:05,982
Bastards!

968
01:26:13,558 --> 01:26:16,228
Come on, let's go to the shelter.

969
01:26:18,225 --> 01:26:21,805
I need to find Calle Don Tello.
Calle Don Tello.

970
01:26:21,892 --> 01:26:24,232
- Cheka?
- Go with him!

971
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:26,180
Young lady, don't!

972
01:26:26,225 --> 01:26:27,425
Stay here!

973
01:26:27,517 --> 01:26:28,807
Isabel?

974
01:26:37,558 --> 01:26:38,808
Let's go.

975
01:26:42,017 --> 01:26:43,227
I have to go back.

976
01:26:48,517 --> 01:26:50,887
The Italian Legionary Air Force
awaits orders.

977
01:26:50,975 --> 01:26:53,425
The three Italian SMS
are awaiting orders.

978
01:26:53,642 --> 01:26:54,932
This way!

979
01:26:55,725 --> 01:26:57,595
Freeze!
This is a restricted area!

980
01:26:57,850 --> 01:27:00,980
- Open the damn door! The mayor sent us!
- You've no jurisdiction here!

981
01:27:01,058 --> 01:27:02,308
Open the fucking door!

982
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:10,563
Open the door!

983
01:27:28,225 --> 01:27:29,385
Stop!

984
01:27:30,225 --> 01:27:31,555
Why are you here?

985
01:27:31,683 --> 01:27:32,733
Okay.

986
01:27:32,767 --> 01:27:33,887
Get out!
Get out!

987
01:27:33,975 --> 01:27:35,055
Just calm down.

988
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,300
- Drop the gun, boy!
- Drop it.

989
01:27:36,392 --> 01:27:37,932
I have orders to shoot!

990
01:27:38,433 --> 01:27:39,433
Put the gun down.

991
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:41,350
Okay.

992
01:27:46,683 --> 01:27:47,733
Teresa!

993
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:49,060
Help!

994
01:27:50,058 --> 01:27:51,848
Help!
Please!

995
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:55,140
Open the door, please!
Help!

996
01:27:55,642 --> 01:27:58,312
Let us out!
Let us out, please!

997
01:27:58,767 --> 01:28:00,767
Please, let us out.

998
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:02,230
Teresa. Teresa!

999
01:28:02,308 --> 01:28:03,728
Get the keys!
On the wall!

1000
01:28:03,767 --> 01:28:05,517
Get the keys! Get the keys!

1001
01:28:09,975 --> 01:28:11,555
Get out!

1002
01:28:12,142 --> 01:28:14,062
Come on, let's go!

1003
01:28:14,808 --> 01:28:16,098
Teresa!

1004
01:28:18,725 --> 01:28:20,345
Henry.

1005
01:28:20,850 --> 01:28:22,680
- Teresa!
- Henry!

1006
01:28:23,017 --> 01:28:24,227
Teresa!

1007
01:28:27,183 --> 01:28:28,183
Okay.

1008
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,680
I got you. I got you.

1009
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:36,272
Henry.

1010
01:28:36,725 --> 01:28:40,345
- Don't leave me alone.
- Never. Never.

1011
01:29:18,892 --> 01:29:21,182
There's a step. There's a step.
There, there.

1012
01:29:21,767 --> 01:29:22,887
This way.

1013
01:29:31,308 --> 01:29:32,558
Shit.

1014
01:30:09,017 --> 01:30:10,387
Planes again!

1015
01:30:12,725 --> 01:30:15,135
- Murderers!
- Run, they're coming back!

1016
01:30:40,558 --> 01:30:41,678
Help!

1017
01:30:42,642 --> 01:30:43,732
Open the door!

1018
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:48,140
- Open up!
- You can't come in, it's full.

1019
01:30:48,308 --> 01:30:50,888
You can't come in.
You can't come in.

1020
01:30:59,892 --> 01:31:02,312
- Have you seen my mum?
- Don't worry. She's coming.

1021
01:31:02,475 --> 01:31:04,385
- And my dad?
- Yes, don't worry.

1022
01:31:06,933 --> 01:31:08,733
- My God!
- It hurts.

1023
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:11,390
Don't worry, calm down.
Look.

1024
01:31:11,725 --> 01:31:15,305
Bite this, okay?
Bite it hard so your eardrums don't burst.

1025
01:31:15,808 --> 01:31:18,388
I've got enough for everyone.
Bite it.

1026
01:31:19,433 --> 01:31:21,853
Bite it hard.
Good, bite it.

1027
01:31:22,058 --> 01:31:24,388
Little guy!
Bite it, that's it, hard!

1028
01:31:28,142 --> 01:31:31,182
- And for me?
- Wait, I think I've got another.

1029
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:33,640
- Will this do?
- Yes, perfect.

1030
01:31:33,767 --> 01:31:35,807
- Thank you.
- There, bite it hard.

1031
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:44,060
Teresa!

1032
01:31:48,517 --> 01:31:50,267
Teresa!

1033
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,140
Go with your side.

1034
01:32:42,892 --> 01:32:44,772
Sit down.

1035
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:19,180
Teresa.

1036
01:33:20,558 --> 01:33:22,268
Teresa, I need you to listen to me.

1037
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:23,680
We have to get out of here.

1038
01:33:23,767 --> 01:33:24,977
It's too dangerous out there.

1039
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:27,138
This ceiling could collapse at any moment.

1040
01:33:28,058 --> 01:33:31,348
If we're gonna die,
let's at least die in the light.

1041
01:33:35,475 --> 01:33:36,555
Come on.

1042
01:34:00,558 --> 01:34:02,518
Don't look.
Shut your eyes.

1043
01:34:02,850 --> 01:34:06,230
- What happened to them?
- Nothing, they're asleep.

1044
01:34:15,225 --> 01:34:18,175
Marco! Marta! We have to
get out of this city.

1045
01:34:18,225 --> 01:34:20,385
Come on. Go!

1046
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,100
Marta.

1047
01:34:28,933 --> 01:34:30,183
This way. This way.

1048
01:34:36,558 --> 01:34:37,558
Come on!

1049
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:04,520
Come on. Hurry up!

1050
01:35:11,892 --> 01:35:13,352
Help!

1051
01:35:16,392 --> 01:35:17,642
Come on!

1052
01:35:40,183 --> 01:35:44,313
Teresa, are you all right?

1053
01:35:45,892 --> 01:35:47,142
We have to keep going.

1054
01:35:54,475 --> 01:35:56,725
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm okay.

1055
01:36:01,475 --> 01:36:05,225
Henry, are you all right?

1056
01:36:22,892 --> 01:36:24,522
Promise me you won't give up.

1057
01:36:24,558 --> 01:36:26,388
Don't speak. Just save your energy.

1058
01:36:28,308 --> 01:36:29,728
Okay, I got you.

1059
01:36:30,183 --> 01:36:32,813
All right, I'm gonna pick you up. Okay?

1060
01:36:32,892 --> 01:36:34,392
I'm gonna carry you.

1061
01:36:43,433 --> 01:36:46,063
You'll follow your heart?

1062
01:36:46,892 --> 01:36:49,182
I will. I will.

1063
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:53,850
Tell the story to the world.

1064
01:36:53,892 --> 01:36:54,932
Henry.

1065
01:36:58,142 --> 01:36:59,602
We need help.

1066
01:37:10,267 --> 01:37:11,267
Sorry.

1067
01:37:14,350 --> 01:37:17,480
There's nothing I can do.
I'm so sorry.

1068
01:38:05,308 --> 01:38:07,018
They will take care of her.

1069
01:38:16,725 --> 01:38:18,675
Henry. Henry.

1070
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:24,095
Are you fine?

1071
01:40:26,475 --> 01:40:28,475
I heard on the radio.

1072
01:40:30,808 --> 01:40:33,098
I need you to take us to the Press Office.

1073
01:40:34,392 --> 01:40:36,562
Yes. Yes. Come on.

1074
01:40:50,225 --> 01:40:52,765
- You have to go.
- What are you doing?

1075
01:40:58,350 --> 01:40:59,350
I don't know.

1076
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:02,430
Go.

1077
01:41:36,517 --> 01:41:37,887
Stop!

1078
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:47,060
Don't move!

1079
01:41:47,308 --> 01:41:49,728
One more step and I'll shoot.

1080
01:42:00,558 --> 01:42:03,018
I need a line to New York.

1081
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:10,520
Whatever they need.

1082
01:42:36,225 --> 01:42:37,555
Listen, George.

1083
01:42:38,933 --> 01:42:41,733
Here's your damn war story.

1084
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:46,730
Twenty-six April, 1937. Gernika.

1085
01:42:47,975 --> 01:42:51,425
Don't give a damn if you use my name
or you have someone else sign it.

1086
01:42:51,517 --> 01:42:54,517
But it's the story I want printed.

1087
01:42:54,558 --> 01:42:55,888
Ready?

1088
01:42:58,850 --> 01:43:04,270
A very small town in the north of Spain
is about to become very famous,

1089
01:43:05,183 --> 01:43:07,353
but for all the wrong reasons.
