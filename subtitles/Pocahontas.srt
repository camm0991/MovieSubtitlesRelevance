00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:04,821
Anything you want.

787
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:12,083
- So...
- Come closer, John Smith.

788
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:17,580
He has a good soul.
And he's handsome, too!

789
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,920
- Oh, I like her.
- I knew you would.

790
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,508
Smith! Smith, where are you, mate?

791
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,173
- We can't let them see us.
- Quick! Over here.

792
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:31,060
This place gives me the creeps.
Savages could be hiding anywhere.

793
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:35,439
If you spot one, don't ask questions.
Just shoot.

794
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:37,357
[grunting]

795
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:41,146
- Watch your feet, you big oaf!
- It wasn't me! It was the tree.

796
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:44,816
Of course! The tree just felt
like lifting its roots...

797
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,615
Let's get out of here.

798
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,699
<i>'</i> Run!

799
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:54,117
But what about Smith?

800
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:57,036
He's a big lad,
he can take care of himself!

801
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:58,375
I'm glad you're on our side.

802
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,507
There's still some snap
in these old vines.

803
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,339
I better get back before
they send the whole camp after me.

804
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:08,302
- When will I see you again?
- Meet me tonight, right here.

805
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:18,187
Well! I haven't had this much
excitement in 200 years.

806
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:21,398
What am I doing?
I shouldn't be seeing him again.

807
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,403
I mean, I want to see him again.

808
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,532
Who wouldn't? I want to see him again.

809
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,536
But, still, something inside
is telling me it's the right thing.

810
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,241
Perhaps it's your dream.

811
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:37,410
My dream? Do you think he's the one
the spinning arrow was pointing to?

812
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,374
Hmm.

813
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,337
The warriors are here.

[chattering]

815
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,734
Pocahontas, are you crazy?
What were you doing with one of them?

816
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,190
<i>- There you are!
- Kocoum!</i>

817
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:08,449
Look at them! Now we have enough
warriors to destroy those white demons!

818
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:14,743
Now that we are joined by our brothers,
we will defeat this enemy.

819
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,047
Father, I need to speak with you.

820
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,800
Not now, my daughter.
The council is gathering.

821
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:30,304
We don't have to fight them.
There must be a better way.

822
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,090
Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.

823
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,806
But maybe we should try talking to them.

824
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,390
They do not want to talk.

825
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:41,228
But if one of them did want to talk,
you would listen to him, wouldn't you?

826
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,313
- Pocahontas...
- Wouldn't you?

827
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:47,651
Of course I would,
but it is not that simple.

828
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,316
Nothing is simple any more.

829
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:58,825

Easy, Thomas, it's me.

839
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:41,994
- Oh, John! I could've killed you.
- Not aiming like that, you couldn't.

840
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,208
Keep both eyes open when you shoot.
You'll see twice as well.

841
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:50,092
- Smith! There you are.
- We were looking all over for you.

842
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,379
Smith! Where have you been?

843
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:56,094
I was out scouting the terrain, sir.

844
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,634
Excellent. Then you must know
the Indians' whereabouts.

845
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,724
We'll need that information
for the battle.

846
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,139
- What battle?
- We will eliminate these savages

847
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:06,104
- once and for all.
- No! You can't do that!

848
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:11,648
- Oh, can't I?
- Look. We don't have to fight them.

849
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,691
- John, what's gotten into you?
- I met one of them.

850
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,076
- You what?
- A savage?

851
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:18,909
They're not savages. They can help us.

852
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:22,496
They know the land.
They know how to navigate the rivers.

853
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:25,624
- And look. It's food.
- What is it?

854
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,914
It's better than hardtack and gruel,
that's for sure.

855
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,081
I like gruel.

856
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,797
They don't want to feed us, you ninnies!

857
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,257
They want to kill us! All of us!

858
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,390
They've got our gold,
and they'll do anything to keep it!

859
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:41,052
- But there is no gold.
- No gold?

860
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,264
And I suppose your little
Indian friend told you this?

861
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:46,774
Yes.

862
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:50,527
Lies. Lies! All of it!
Murderous thieves.

863
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,734
There's no room for their kind
in civilized society.

864
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,193
But this is their land!

865
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,610
This is my land!
I make the laws here.

866
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:01,952
And I say anyone who so much
as looks at an Indian

867
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:07,462
without killing him on sight
will be tried for treason and hanged.

- [coyotes howl]

[Nakoma] Pocahontas!

870
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,632
- Nakoma.
- Don't go out there.

871
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:19,048
I lied for you once,
don't ask me to do it again.

872
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,636
I have to do this.

873
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,847
- He's one of them!
- You don't know him.

874
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,809
If you go out there, you'll be turning
your back on your own people.

875
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,269
I'm trying to help my people.

876
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,561
Pocahontas, please,
you're my best friend.

877
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,354
I don't want you to get hurt.

878
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,400
- I won't. I know what I'm doing.
- Pocahontas, no!

879
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:46,830
Ratcliffe wouldn't take us
halfway around the world for nothing.

880
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:50,292
But what if Smith is right?
What if there is no gold?

881
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,583
If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been
lying to us since we left London.

882
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:55,592
Listen to you, you bunch of idiots.

883
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:58,095
Those savages didn't
attack us for nothing.

884
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,846
They're hiding something.

885
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:03,350
If they do have the gold,
I reckon we'll have to fight them.

886
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:06,012
<i>- Not me. I'm not risking my neck...
- Either too hot or too cold.</i>

887
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:08,681
I haven't been comfortable
since we got here.

888
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,351
[man] Me, too. I'm itching a lot.

889
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,241
[gasping]

890
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,822
- Follow him.
- Yes, Governor.

891
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,283
I want to know where
he's sneaking off to.

892
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:27,450
- Yes, sir.
- If you happen to see any Indians...

893
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,952
...shoot them.

894
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:36,341
And, Thomas,
you've been a slipshod sailor

895
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,878
and a poor excuse for a soldier.

896
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,342
Don't disappoint me again.

897
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,608
<i>- Kocoum.
- What is it?</i>

898
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,315
- It's Pocahontas.
- What's wrong? Is she all right?

899
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,280
I think she's in trouble.

900
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:09,917
The earth is trembling, child.
What's happened?

901
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,418
The warriors are here.

<i>- Pocahontas.
- John!</i>

903

Listen to me. My men are planning
to attack your people.

904
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:19,668
You've got to warn them.

905
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:21,963
Maybe it's not too late to stop this.

906
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,177
You have to come with me
and talk to my father.

907
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,888
Pocahontas, talking
isn't going to do any good.

908
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,723
I already tried talking to my men,

909
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,854
but everything
about this land has them spooked.

You see what I mean? Once two sides
want to fight, nothing can stop them.

00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:55,041
- Come here, both of you!

[John] Percy, get back here!

Now then, there's something
I want to show you. Look!

<i>- The ripples.
- What about them?</i>

So small at first,
then look how they grow.

929

But someone has to start them

930
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:38,918
They're not going to listen to us.

931

Young man, sometimes the right path
is not the easiest one.

Don't you see?

933
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:49,596
Only when the fighting stops
can you be together.

934
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,223
All right. Let's go talk to your father.

01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:13,715
What will yours be?

1095
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:26,152
[wind whistling]

1096
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:52,345
My daughter speaks
with a wisdom beyond her years.

1097
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:55,677
We have all come here
with anger in our hearts,

1098
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,935
but she comes with
courage and understanding.

1099
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:03,978
From this day forward,
if there is to be more killing

1100
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,313
it will not start with me.

1101
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:10,859
Release him.

1102
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,042
Now is our chance! Fire!

1103
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:33,007
<i>-</i> [Thomas] No.
- What?

1104
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,718
- They let him go!
- They don't want to fight!

1105
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,054
It's a trick, don't you see? Fire!

1106
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,765
Fine! I'll settle this myself.

1107
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,398
No!

1108
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:51,938
John!

1109
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:58,903
You shot him!

1110
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:02,574
He stepped right into it!
It's his own fault!

1111
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:03,912
[Ben] Smith was right all along.

1112
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:05,247
[man] We never
should've listened to you.

1113
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,663
- [Ben] Get the gun!
- Traitors!

1114
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:09,672
Unhand me, I say. How dare you!

1115
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,583
Put him in chains!

1116
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:14,172
I'll see you all hanged for this!

1117
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:16,463
- And gag him as well!
- [grunting, yelling]

1118
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,933
[seagulls cry]

1119
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:29,854
Is he going to make it, Thomas?

1120
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:31,777
The sooner he gets to England,
the better.

1121
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,609
Let's hope the wind is with him.

1122
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:36,115
- Is the ship ready yet?
- Any minute now.

1123
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:38,868
Just loading the last bit of cargo.

1124
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:40,403
[muffled screaming]

1125
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:46,584
Untie me at once!
I'll have your head for this!

1126
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:49,747
[sniffling] And he came
so highly recommended.

1127
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,040
[sighing]

1128
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,473
The ship's almost ready.

1129
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:03,259
We'd better get you on board.
We'll lose the tide.

1130
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,805
No, not yet. She said she'd be here.

1131
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,224
Look.

1132
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,669
Going back is his only chance.

1133
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:40,338
He'll die if he stays here.

1134
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:50,519
Here.

1135
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:53,025
It's from Grandmother Willow's bark.

1136
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:55,027
It'll help with the pain.

1137
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:58,440
What pain?
I've had worse pain than this.

1138
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:01,526
Can't think of any right now, but...

1139
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:11,377
You are always welcome
among our people.

1140
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,871
Thank you, my brother.

1141
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:20,048
- I thought you didn't like strangers.
- [chirps]

1142
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:30,221
My mother's necklace.

1143
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:35,481
- [whimpering]
- See ya, Percy.

1144
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,772
[sneezing]

1145
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,249
Come with me'?

1146
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:01,218
You must choose your own path.

1147
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,644
I'm needed here.

1148
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,690
Then... I'll stay with you.

1149
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:25,701
No. You have to go back.

1150
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:28,613
<i>- But I can't leave you.
- You never will.</i>

1151
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:32,955
No matter what happens,
I'll always be with you...

1152
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:35,036
...forever.

1153
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:05,154
- Good luck, lad.
- Godspeed, John.

1154
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,662
- [man] The crew a-ready?
- [man 2] Aye, sir!

1155
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,747
Set the mainsails.

1156
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:20,502
[man] Weigh anchor!

1157
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,755
[man 2] Let go of the topgallants!

1158
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:37,143
[panting]

1159
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:51,614
[wind singing]
