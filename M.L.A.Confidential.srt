SID:
Come to Los Angeles.

2
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,166
The sun shines bright,
the beaches are wide and inviting...

3
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:36,920
...and the orange groves
stretch as far as the eye can see.

4
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:41,042
There are jobs aplenty and land is cheap.

5
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,594
Every workingman
can have his own house...

6
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:48,516
...and inside every house,
a happy, all-American family.

7
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,723
You can have all this.
And who knows?

8
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,979
You could even be discovered...

9
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,437
...become a movie star,
or at least see one.

10
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,897
Life is good in Los Angeles.

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,734
It's paradise on Earth.

12
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:08,911
That's what they tell you, anyway,
because they're selling an image.

13
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,790
They're selling it through movies,
radio and television.

14
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:16,828
In the hit show Badge of Honor,
the L.A. cops walk on water...

15
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,463
...as they keep the city
clean of crooks.

16
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,000
Yep, you'd think this place
was the Garden of Eden.

17
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,419
But there's trouble in paradise...

18
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:29,966
...and his name is Meyer Harris Cohen,
Mickey C to his fans.

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,850

...Johnny Stompanato.

22
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,563
Mickey C's the head
of organized crime in these parts.

23
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:45,778
He runs dope, rackets and prostitution.
He kills a dozen people a year...

24
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,485
...and the dapper little gent
does it in style.

25
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,621
And every time his picture's
on the front page...

26
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,828
...it's a black eye
for the image of Los Angeles.

27
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,460
Because how can organized crime exist...

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,164
...in the city with the best
police force in the world?

29
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,628
Something has to be done.

30
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,885
But nothing too original,
because, hey, this is Hollywood.

31
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,214
What worked for Al Capone
would work for the Mickster.

32
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,681
Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.
Nonpayment of federal income tax.

33
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,603
But all is not well.

34
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,899
Sending Mickey up has created a vacuum,
and it's only a matter of time...

35
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:25,063
...before someone
with balls of brass tries to fill it.

Brett Chase doesn't

Well, that's because
he's the television version.

- Yeah, I wonder.
- Got himself a real career going.

Sergeant Williams, pick up, please.

Lieutenant Exley.

You've got a homicide downtown.

479
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:55,521
- The Nite Owl Coffee Shop.
- I got it. It's mine.

Sir, at least one person's dead.
I stopped for coffee.

Yes, sir.

483

I want barricades at both ends
of the street. Make sure--

Sir? I took the call. It's my case.

You don't want it, Edmund,
and you can't have it.

OFFICER 1: The back door.
OFFICER 2: Nobody else inside.

490
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,415
Looks like the cook drew a handgun
and set it off.

491
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,497
The rest were killed in the men's room.

Sir...

493
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:24,170
...we got a total of 15 spent
12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.

494
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:28,557
I'm betting three men, five-shot capacity
pumps, all of them emptying once.

495

Excuse me, sir, we got an ID
on one of the victims.

It's Dick Stensland.

she was Rita Hayworth.

Appears three men
held up a coffee shop.

502
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,431
The guy at the register pulled a .38,
so they killed him.

503
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:14,303
Then they took everyone else out back
and killed them too.

It seems like my Susan...

509

...but my Susan was a blond,
not a redhead.

510

When was the last time you saw her?

511
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,623
Just before Christmas.

512
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,089
We'd fought.
I didn't like her boyfriend.

513

CORONER: Mrs. Lefferts, does your daughter
have any distinguishing characteristics?

You got the wrong idea, mister.
I'm fine.

She has a birthmark on her hip.

00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,369
Captain Smith and myself.
Why?

522
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,460
SMITH:
"The Nite Owl Massacre."

Hyperbole aside...

that requires swift resolution.

One of them one of our own.
Dick Stensland.

527
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:39,809
As it happens, he was a Nite Owl regular,
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

528
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,189
Robbery is the likely motive.

529
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,484
We have rubber-glove smears
on the register...

530
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,614
...and preliminary forensics strongly tend
towards a trio of shooters.

...were seen discharging shotguns
last night in Griffith Park.

534
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:01,288
A park ranger lD'd them as driving
a 1948 to 1950 Mercury coupe...

535
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,870
...maroon in color.

turned up a news vendor...

00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:10,928
...who saw a maroon Merc parked
across from the Nite Owl around 1 a.m.

538
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,219
DMV has come up with
a registration list of Merc coupes.

Forty-eight two-man teams will shake
three names apiece.

He told me what happened to Sue.

Everything all right, doll?
Want me to get rid of him?

- Would you care for a drink?
- Yeah, Scotch straight.

I was friendly with Sue Lefferts,
but we weren't friends.

You know what I mean?

Patchett's running whores
cut to look like movie stars.

644
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:35,155
And judging by his address,
probably something bigger on the side.

He doesn't want any attention.

646

That's right. Our motives are selfish,
so we're cooperating.

So cooperate. Why was
Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?

He takes a cut of our earnings
and invests it for us.

He doesn't let us use narcotics
and he doesn't abuse us.

So let's dig deep...

...and let's get a moral man re-elected.
Ellis Loew would like a few words.

928
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:09,754
Thank you. Thank you, Brett Chase,
the very talented star of Badge of Honor.

929
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:16,222
Let me tell you, I am so thrilled to be here
on the set of Badge of Honor.

01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:18,637
SID:
Big V. Jackie.

931
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,605
Good to see you back.

932
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:24,559
- How they hanging, Sid?
- Down around my ankles.

933
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:27,813
- You tight with the DA, Jackie?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

934
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:30,448
He tried to throw me off the force
last Christmas.

935
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,325
How about some payback, bigtime?

936
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:36,704
Plus the usual $50 donation
to the Jack Vincennes retirement fund.

937
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:40,834
- Did you know the DA was a swish?
- No kidding.

938
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,994
Uh...

939
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:46,543
Remember Matt Reynolds? Christmas Eve?
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust"?

940
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:49,380
- He just got off the honor farm.
- What's he doing here?

941
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,845
Reynolds is acey-deucey,
not to mention broke.

942
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:55,302
I'm getting him
to fuck the DA for 100 bucks.

943
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:58,514
That's twice the 50
you got for wrecking his career.

944
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:02,768
- Hey, Matt. Come here, come here.
- Jesus, don't bring him--

945
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:09,358
That's DA Loew right there.

946
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,278
Yeah.

01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:15,906
You need a drink, kid?

948
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:20,078
- Yeah.
- Jack, look after him a minute.

949
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:24,210
Matt, this is Jack.
No secrets between me and him.

950
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:31,880
- How you doing?
- Oh, I'm okay. How are you?

951
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:34,296
I'm good. Yeah.

952

Have we, uh, met before?

953
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:41,720
Yeah.

954
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:46,224
- Was it at a party?
- Well, it was something like that.

955
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:49,436
Fleur-de-Lis party, right?

956
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:51,900
Right.

957
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,065
Fleur-de-Lis.

Dope, hookers that
look like movie stars...

- Pierce Patchett has it all.
- Ha-ha-ha.

961
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:04,701
Boy, you could say that again.

962
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:10,507
Pierce, he's not like regular guys.
I mean, I dig him, but...

963
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:15,594
...you know, he, um, scares me too.

964
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:18,931
Really? How?

965
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:24,979
When I came out to L.A., this isn't
exactly where I saw myself ending up.

966
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:28,938
Yeah, well, get in line.

967
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:31,528
That's courage, kid. Drink up.

968
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:38,489
You know, I don't think I should do this.

969
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:40,744
It's not like you don't know how.

970
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,747
And Jack here's got connections
with Badge of Honor.

971
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,000
You pull this off,
there'll be a part for you.

972

I smell a comeback, don't you, Jack?

973
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:55,885
Go on. The DA's free.
Go introduce yourself. Go on.

974
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:58,968
Talk to him, Jack.
Tell him about the opening on the show.

975
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:02,384
Oh, yeah. I'm pretty sure I can get you
a part on this show.

976
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:04,601
But, uh, that's later on.

977
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:09,267
You know, tonight, just go on over there
and pretend it's an acting job.

978
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:12,402
- Like show biz.
- Acting, that's it.

01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,652
- Right.
- Yeah.

980
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:16,530

- No.

It'll be our secret.

01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,990
Okay. All right.

which I know he will...

...they'll be at the
Hollywood Center Motel, Room 203.

Meet me there at midnight
for a photo shoot.

Maybe we can work in
the Hollywood sign this time.

What do you know
about Pierce Patchett?

Patchett? I know what you know.
He's very rich.

991
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:57,522
Just invested in freeway construction,
which is gonna make him richer.

992
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:58,947
Why do you ask?

993
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:01,234
I just keep hearing rumors, you know.

994
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,654
High-class porn, drugs,
hookers that look like movie stars.

995
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:09,618
Ha. Patchett's what I call twilight.
He ain't queer and he ain't red.

996
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:13,505
He cannot help me
in my quest for prime "sinnuendo."

Sure.

they left you at midnight.

They might have.

- He tied me to the radiator.

...she thought she saw Susie's boyfriend
and another man...

- What was the boyfriend's name?
- We weren't properly introduced.
