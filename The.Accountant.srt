It's an unusual audio file.

919
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,035
Solomon Grundy is a nursery rhyme
circa mid-1800s.

920
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,555
Your voice has four of
the six intonation patterns

921

we use to define American English.

That's difficult to confirm with a rhyme.

Out of curiosity,
was your subject a trauma victim?

924
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,957
Um, why do you ask that?

925
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,475
Well, you indicated on your submission

Yeah. Exceptionally.

01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,959
That's interesting.

929
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,630

a total of four and a half times

930

with zero variation in pitch, span, tempo,
volume, or articulatory precision.

So, what does that mean, exactly?

932
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,548
Well, we often see
this type of repetitive chanting

Neurodevelopmental disorders?

Fragile-X syndrome, autism.

they wanted $1700 for this dress,

Chris, why are we here?

1062
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,240
Um...

1063
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,189
I thought this hotel
had good water pressure.

1064
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,752
The Holiday Inn Express in Aurora
has good water pressure.

1065
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,593
Yes, but these towels are very fancy,

1066
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,633
and cheaper hotels have scratchy towels.

1067
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,479
And

1068
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,079
I wanted you to like it.

Crazy Eddie and the Panama Pump.

1070
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,473
Crazy Eddie Antar and the Panama Pump.
Have you ever heard of...

1071
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,949
- What?
- Crazy Eddie Antar.

1072
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:55,159
He owned a string of electronic stores
in New York City in the '80s.

1073
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,830
Crazy Eddie Antar, he started stealing
almost as soon as he opened business.

1074
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,115
Okay, I'm not following.

1075
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,952
He deposited money in Tel Aviv,

1076
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:05,078
and then he cycled it through Panama
and put it back into his stores.

1077
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,760
Okay, why take it out and put it back?

1078
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,957
Well, initially he was just stealing
in garden-variety tax evasion,

1079
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,315
but then he came up with a better idea.

1080
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,391
You see, by taking his own money,

1081
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,949
stealing it, and putting it back
on his books...

1082
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,593
He was raining cash.

1083
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,671
He took the company public at $8 a share.

1084
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,513
A year later, it was trading at $75.

1085
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,516
- Rita's taking Living Robotics public.
- Yes.

1086
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,440
But why would she hire you
in the first place

1087
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,630
if she thought you would figure it out?

1088
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,194
I don't know.

1089
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,193

to our detention center in D. C.

1364
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,711
Did the work of five men.

1365
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,111
Data mining, cluster analysis.

1366
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,278
He roomed with Francis.

1367
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:22,439
They kept to themselves, played chess,

1368
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,070
ate together, sat in the TV room together.

1369
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:28,953
They were inseparable.

1370
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:32,278
And then one day, a guard told Wolff

1371
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:35,796
why Francis hadn't called or written
since he got out.

1372
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:40,234
That his burnt body had been found
in a Staten Island landfill.

1373
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:45,396
Wolff snapped, went after the guard.

1374
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,752
He fractured the man's skull
with a thermos.

1375
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,511
Escaped from a third-floor window.

1376
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,273
Took the thermos.

1377
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:58,196
That's all you got? I mean, Leavenworth,
he'll have military records...

1378
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,032
Records are all heavily redacted.

1379
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,952
Well, then arrest records, something?

1380
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:06,479
Spring of 2003, at a funeral home
in Kankakee, Illinois.

1381
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:12,192
Our boy sends six locals to the hospital
with a variety of injuries.

1382
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,313
No one knew Wolff.

1383
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,278
The older man who came with him
was identified as a colonel, US Army.

1384
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,799
A funeral home.

1385
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,799
Whose wake?

1386
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,190
One customer that day.

1387
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,516
Mrs. Lauren Alton.

1389
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:43,476
Survived by a husband
and two boys, ages 12 and 10.

1390
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,031
By all accounts,
an ordinary life, well lived.

1391

His late wife's former husband.

No more real than "Christian Wolff."
