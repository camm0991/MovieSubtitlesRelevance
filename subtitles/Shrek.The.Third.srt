1
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,915
Onward, Ohauncey!

2
00:00:58,055 --> 00:01:00,649
To the highest room
of the tallest tower...

3
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:05,888
...where my princess awaits rescue
from her handsome Prince Oharming!

4
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:21,007
This is worse than " Love Letters" .
I hate dinner theater!

5
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:22,908
Me, too.

6
00:01:24,248 --> 00:01:26,239
Whoa there, Ohauncey!

7
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:31,109
Hark! The brave Prince Oharming
approacheth.

8
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:35,624
Fear not, fair maiden. I shall slay
the monster that guards you...

9
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,695
...then take my place as rightful king.

10
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:40,421
What did she say?

11
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:45,600
It's Shrek!

12
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,531
Whoo, Shrek, yeah!

13
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:51,867
Prepare, foul beast...

14
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:56,673
...to enter into a world of pain
with which you are not familiar!

15
00:01:56,814 --> 00:01:59,374
<i>Happy birthday to thee
Happy birthday to thee</i>

16
00:01:59,517 --> 00:02:00,779
Do you mind?

17
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,281
Do you mind? Boring!

18
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:11,125
Prepare, foul beast...

19
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:22,833
Someday you'll be sorry.

20
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:25,134
We already are!

21
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:51,564
Mommy...

22
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:58,998
You're right. I can't let this happen.

23
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:01,175
I can't !

24
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:06,112
I am the rightful King of Far Far Away.

25
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,343
And I promise you this, Mother...

26
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:11,416
...I will restore dignity to my throne.

27
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:17,118
And this time,

28
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:21,425
no one will stand in my way.

29
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:40,043
Good morning.

30
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:42,712
Good morning.

31
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:45,412
Morning breath.

32
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:48,719
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

33
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:51,224
<i>Good morning, good morning</i>

34
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:54,296
<i>The sun is shining through</i>

35
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:56,626
<i>Good morning, good morning
To you</i>

36
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,894
<i>And you!
And you!</i>

37
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:04,501
They grow up so fast.

38
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:06,735
Not fast enough.

39
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:11,508
You'll be filling in
for the King and Queen.

40
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:14,846
Several functions
require your attendance, sir.

41
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:18,284
Great! Let's get started.

42
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:21,255
Oome on, lazybones. Time to get moving!

43
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:24,356
You need to get a pair ofjammies.

44
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:35,033
<i>I got some sleep and I needed it</i>

45
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:37,902
<i>Not a lot, just a little bit</i>

46
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:41,136
<i>Someone's always
trying to keep me from it</i>

47
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:44,111
<i>It's a crying shame</i>

48
00:04:44,782 --> 00:04:47,148
<i>It's a royal pain in the neck</i>

49
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:48,945
I knight thee.

50
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:13,936
If you're filling in for a king,
you should look like one.

51
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:17,138
Oan somebody come in
and work on Shrek?

52
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:20,473
I will see what I can do.

53
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:43,333
Yeah, wow.

54
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:46,665
Is this really necessary?

55
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:49,105
Quite necessary, Fiona.

56
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:52,044
- I'm Shrek, you twit.
- Whatever.

57
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:55,879
This isn't a rehearsal, peoples.
Let's see some hustle!

58
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,954
Smiles, everyone! Smiles!

59
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:01,546
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

60
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:04,627
I'm sorry, but can you
just try to grin and bear it?

61
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:06,787
It's just until Dad gets better.

62
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,197
Shrek?

63
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:13,127
You look handsome.

64
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,204
Oome here, you.

65
00:06:29,553 --> 00:06:34,217
My butt is itching up a storm and
I can't reach it in this monkey suit.

66
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:37,994
Hey, you! Oome here. What's your name?

67
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:40,494
Fiddlesworth, sir.

68
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:41,723
Perfect.

69
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:46,767
Ladies and gentlemen...

70
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:50,067
...Princess Fiona and Sir Shrek!

71
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:56,174
Ahh! You've got it.

72
00:06:56,313 --> 00:06:57,837
A little to the left.

73
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,278
That's it! That's good.

74
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:04,512
Oh, yeah! Scratch
that thing! You're on it.

75
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:06,088
Shrek!

76
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:12,120
My eye!

77
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:13,422
What are you doing?

78
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:20,992
Fiona!

79
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:27,339
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

80
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:33,280
Shrimp! My favorite!

81
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:46,490
- That's it! We're leaving!
- Oalm down.

82
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,567
Oalm down? Who do you think
we're kidding? I am an ogre.

83
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:55,297
I'm not cut out for this, Fiona,
and I never will be.

84
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:00,741
I think that went well.

85
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:02,106
Donkey!

86
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:03,975
Oome on, Shrek!

87
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:07,712
Some people just don't
understand boundaries.

88
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:21,590
Just think. A couple more days
and we'll be back home...

89
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:25,031
...in our vermin-filled shack
strewn with fungus...

90
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,070
...and filled with the stench
of mud and neglect.

91
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:30,833
You had me at "vermin-filled" .

92
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:36,510
And, um... maybe even the pitter-patter
of little feet on the floor.

93
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:39,710
That's right, the swamp rats
will be spawning.

94
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,215
Uh, no.

95
00:08:41,351 --> 00:08:45,048
What I'm thinking of is a little bigger
than a swamp rat.

96
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:46,213
Donkey?

97
00:08:46,356 --> 00:08:50,019
No, Shrek. What if, theoretically...

98
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:53,422
...they were little ogre feet?

99
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,237
Honey, let's be rational about this.

100
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:05,739
Have you seen a baby lately?

101
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:09,073
They just eat and poop, and they cry...

102
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:12,580
...then they cry when they poop
and poop when they cry.

103
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:15,514
Now, imagine an ogre baby.

104
00:09:15,652 --> 00:09:19,452
They extra-cry and they extra-poop.

105
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,185
Shrek, don't you ever think
about having a family?

106
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:26,888
Right now, you're my family.

107
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:33,062
Somebody better be dying.

108
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:37,235
I'm dying.

109
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:40,736
Harold?

110
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:46,007
Don't forget
to pay the gardener, Lillian.

111
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:48,083
Of course, darling.

112
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,878
Fiona.

113
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:52,545
Yes, Daddy?

114
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:55,419
I know I made many mistakes with you.

115
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:57,893
It's okay.

116
00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:00,155
But your love for Shrek has...

117
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:02,497
...taught me much.

118
00:10:04,635 --> 00:10:06,626
My dear boy...

119
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,035
...I am proud to call you my son.

120
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:13,301
And I'm proud to call you my frog...

121
00:10:13,443 --> 00:10:15,877
...King dad-in-law.

122
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:21,610
Now there is a matter
of business to attend to.

123
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:34,954
The Frog King... is dead.

124
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,108
Put your hat back on, fool.

125
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:46,834
Shrek...

126
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:48,638
...please come hither.

127
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:53,847
Yeah, Dad?

128
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:57,147
This kingdom needs a new king.

129
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:03,152
You and Fiona
are next in line for the throne.

130
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:09,026
Next in line. You see, Dad,
that's why people love you.

131
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,499
Even on your deathbed,
you're still making jokes.

132
00:11:16,173 --> 00:11:19,870
Oome on, Dad. An ogre as king?

133
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,535
That's not such a good idea.

134
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,978
There must be somebody else. Anybody!

135
00:11:26,116 --> 00:11:31,315
Aside from you, there is
only one remaining heir.

136
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,652
Really? Who is he, Dad?

137
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,850
His name is...

138
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:39,286
...is...

139
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:41,056
What's his name?

140
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:42,790
...is...

141
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:45,793
Daddy!

142
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:05,021
His name is Arthur.

143
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:06,554
Arthur?

144
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:14,091
I know you'll do...

145
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:16,893
...what's right.

146
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:21,267
Harold?

147
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:22,963
Dad? Dad!

148
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:25,636
Dad?

149
00:12:26,243 --> 00:12:27,835
Do your thing, man.

150
00:12:57,774 --> 00:13:01,642
<i>When you were young and your heart</i>

151
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:03,939
<i>Was an open book</i>

152
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:10,079
<i>you used to say live and let live</i>

153
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,553
<i>you know you did, you know you did
you know you did</i>

154
00:13:14,357 --> 00:13:19,420
<i>But if this ever changing world
In which we live in</i>

155
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:24,461
<i>Makes you give in and cry</i>

156
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,131
<i>Say live and let die</i>

157
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:34,237
<i>Live and let die</i>

158
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:14,513
<i>Hey, lady
you, lady</i>

159
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,680
<i>Cursing at your life</i>

160
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:21,017
<i>you're a discontented mother</i>

161
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:25,354
<i>And a regimented wife</i>

162
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:54,217
What does a prince
have to do to get a drink here?

163
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,254
Ah, Mabel!

164
00:14:57,394 --> 00:15:01,797
Why they call you an ugly stepsister,
I'll never know.

165
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:05,993
Where's Doris? Taking the night off?

166
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:09,902
She's not welcome here,
and neither are you.

167
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:13,600
What do you want, Oharming?

168
00:15:13,743 --> 00:15:17,804
Not much. Just a chance at redemption.

169
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,883
And a Fuzzy Navel.

170
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:24,077
And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends!

171
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:30,152
We're not your friends.

172
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:34,489
You don't belong here.

173
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:38,795
You're absolutely right,
but, I mean, do any of us?

174
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:40,562
Do a number on his face.

175
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:45,300
Wait, wait, wait!
We are more alike than you think.

176
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:49,344
Wicked Witch! The Seven Dwarfs
saved Snow White, and what happened?

177
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,571
Oh, what's it to you?

178
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:52,978
They left you the unfairest of them all.

179
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:57,644
Now here you are,
hustling pool to get your next meal.

180
00:15:57,787 --> 00:15:59,618
How does that feel?

181
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:06,687
Pretty unfair.

182
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,229
And you!

183
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:12,995
Your star puppet abandons the show
to go and find his father.

184
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:16,597
I hate that little wooden puppet.

185
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,708
And Hook.

186
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:20,434
Need I say more?

187
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:26,911
- And you, Frumpypigskin!
- Rumpelstiltskin.

188
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,678
Where's that firstborn
you were promised?

189
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:35,990
Mabel. Remember how you
couldn't get your little fat foot...

190
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:38,026
...into that tiny glass slipper?

191
00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:44,224
Oinderella is
in Far Far Away right now...

192
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:49,395
...eating bonbons, cavorting with
every last fairy tale creature...

193
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:52,007
...that has ever done you wrong!

194
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:57,079
Once upon a time, someone decided
that we were the losers.

195
00:16:57,213 --> 00:17:00,080
But there are
two sides to every story...

196
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,775
...and our side has not been told!

197
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:07,788
So who will join me? Who wants
to come out on top for once?

198
00:17:07,924 --> 00:17:09,585
Who wants their...

199
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:12,889
..." happily ever after" ?

200
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,741
This way, gents.

201
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:48,121
<i>It's out of my hands, senorita. The
winds of fate have blown on my destiny.</i>

202
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:52,064
But I will never forget you.
You are the love of my life.

203
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:54,636
As are you.

204
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:57,137
And, uh, you.

205
00:17:57,273 --> 00:18:00,436
I don't know you, but I'd like to.

206
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:02,942
I got to go!

207
00:18:04,347 --> 00:18:06,042
I don't wanna leave you either.

208
00:18:06,182 --> 00:18:09,015
But you know how Shrek is.
The dude's lost without me.

209
00:18:09,953 --> 00:18:13,286
But don't worry. I'll send you
airmail kisses every day!

210
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:15,989
Be strong, babies.

211
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,560
Ooco, Peanut, listen to your mama.

212
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:22,688
Bananas, no roasting marshmallows
on your sister's head.

213
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:26,328
That's my special boy!

214
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:29,563
Oome here, all of you!
Give your daddy a big hug!

215
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:37,477
Shrek?

216
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:42,781
Maybe you should just stay and be King.

217
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:46,446
Oome on. There's no way
I could run a kingdom.

218
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:49,581
That's why your cousin Arthur
is a perfect choice.

219
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:52,251
It's not that. You see...

220
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:56,855
And if he gives me trouble,
I always have persuasion and reason.

221
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,333
Here's persuasion... and here's reason.

222
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:04,138
Fiona...

223
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:07,539
...soon it's just going to be you, me...

224
00:19:07,677 --> 00:19:09,338
...and our swamp.

225
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:13,672
It's not going to be just you and me.

226
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:16,851
All aboard!

227
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:20,854
It will be. I promise.

228
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:23,515
I love you.

229
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:31,794
That's lovely.

230
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:33,527
Bye-bye, babies!

231
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,304
Shrek!

232
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:45,741
- Wait!
- What is it?

233
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:47,372
I'm ... I'm ...

234
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,252
I love you, too, honey!

235
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:56,222
No! I said I'm ...

236
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:00,662
You're what?

237
00:20:00,797 --> 00:20:03,231
I said I'm pregnant!

238
00:20:07,403 --> 00:20:08,870
What was that?

239
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:12,065
You're going to be a father!

240
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,707
That's great!

241
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:19,110
Really? I'm glad you think so!

242
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:20,648
I love you!

243
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:22,774
Yeah!

244
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,251
Me, too! You!

245
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,617
I'm going to be an uncle!
I'm going to be an uncle!

246
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:35,822
And you, my friend, are royally...

247
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:15,526
Home.

248
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:29,148
Shrek!

249
00:21:31,487 --> 00:21:32,818
Fiona!

250
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:38,157
Fiona?

251
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,779
Oh, no.

252
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:04,852
Better out than in, I always say.

253
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,861
No, no, no!

254
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:20,594
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.

255
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,036
Stop! Hey, wait!

256
00:23:17,427 --> 00:23:18,951
Donkey. Donkey!

257
00:23:19,095 --> 00:23:20,323
Wake up!

258
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:24,096
Dada!

259
00:23:26,536 --> 00:23:28,527
Shrek! Are you okay?

260
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:35,802
I can't believe I'm going to be
a father. How did this happen?

261
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:40,143
Allow me to explain. When a man
has feelings for a woman...

262
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:42,808
...a powerful urge sweeps over him.

263
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:45,443
I know how it happened.

264
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:48,348
I just can't believe it.

265
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:52,958
How does it happen?

266
00:23:59,969 --> 00:24:05,236
<i>And the cat's in the cradle
and the silver spoon</i>

267
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:08,002
<i>Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon</i>

268
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:10,738
<i>When you coming home, son?
I don't know when</i>

269
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,178
<i>But we'll get together then, Dad.</i>

270
00:24:13,316 --> 00:24:15,307
Donkey! Oan you just cut to the part

271
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:17,976
where you're supposed
to make me feel better?

272
00:24:18,721 --> 00:24:21,246
You know I love Fiona, boss. Right?

273
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:25,451
What I am talking about
is you, me, my cousin's boat...

274
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:31,192
...an ice cold pitcher of mojitos
and two weeks of nothing but fishing.

275
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:33,199
Don't listen to him!

276
00:24:33,336 --> 00:24:36,032
Having a baby
isn't going to ruin your life.

277
00:24:36,172 --> 00:24:40,700
It's not my life I'm worried
about ruining, it's the kid's .

278
00:24:40,843 --> 00:24:45,143
When have you ever heard the phrase
"as sweet as an ogre" ...

279
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:47,715
...or " as nurturing as an ogre" ...

280
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:52,219
...or "You'll love
my dad. He's a real ogre."

281
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:54,118
Okay. I get it.

282
00:24:54,257 --> 00:24:57,715
It's not going to be easy.
But you got us to help you.

283
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,555
That's true.

284
00:24:59,695 --> 00:25:01,162
I'm doomed.

285
00:25:01,297 --> 00:25:02,958
You'll be fine.

286
00:25:03,866 --> 00:25:05,766
You're finished.

287
00:25:08,037 --> 00:25:10,699
Uh, with yourjourney.

288
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:23,318
"Wor-ces-ters-shiree" ?
Now that sounds fancy!

289
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:24,783
It's Worcestershire.

290
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:26,752
Like the sauce?

291
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:28,220
It's spicy!

292
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:33,892
They must be expecting us.

293
00:25:39,802 --> 00:25:42,600
What in the shista-shire
kind of place is this?

294
00:25:42,738 --> 00:25:47,937
Well, my stomach aches and my palms
just got sweaty. Must be a high school.

295
00:25:48,077 --> 00:25:49,237
High school?

296
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:50,936
Ready? Okay!

297
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,514
Wherefore art thou headed, to the top?

298
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:57,608
Yeah, we think so, we think so! And
dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped?

299
00:25:57,753 --> 00:26:00,221
Nay, we thinkst not, we thinkst not!

300
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:09,487
All right, Mr. Percival,
ease up on the reins.

301
00:26:12,835 --> 00:26:16,532
For lo, bro, don't burn
all my frankincense and myrrh.

302
00:26:16,672 --> 00:26:20,164
I'm feeling nauseous from memories
of wedgies and swirlies!

303
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:24,973
How did you receive wedgies when you are
clearly not the wearer of underpants?

304
00:26:25,114 --> 00:26:28,015
Let's just say some things
are better left unsaid.

305
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,211
So I was all like, " I'd rather get
the black plague than go out with you."

306
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:34,687
- Oh, totally.
- Pardon me.

307
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:37,622
- Totally ew-eth.
- Yeah, totally.

308
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:41,822
I just altered my character level
to +3 superb-ability.

309
00:26:41,964 --> 00:26:44,524
Hi. We're looking for someone named...

310
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:49,195
Who rolled a +9 dork spell and
summoned the beast and his quadruped?

311
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,534
I know you're busy not fitting in, but
can you tell me where I can find Arthur?

312
00:26:55,678 --> 00:26:56,975
He's over there.

313
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:21,569
There is no sweeter taste
on thy tongue than victory!

314
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:26,873
Strong, handsome, face of a leader.

315
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:30,342
Does Arthur look like a king or what?

316
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:32,845
Sorry.

317
00:27:33,582 --> 00:27:36,210
Did you say you were looking for Arthur?

318
00:27:36,352 --> 00:27:38,786
That information is
on a need-to-know basis.

319
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:40,616
It's top secret!

320
00:27:40,756 --> 00:27:44,351
Now, gentlemen, let's away.
To the showers!

321
00:27:46,862 --> 00:27:48,489
Greetings, Your Majesty.

322
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:50,189
This is your lucky day.

323
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:53,126
What are you supposed to be?

324
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:56,534
Some kind of giant mutant leprechaun
or something?

325
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,032
Giant mutant... You made a funny.

326
00:28:01,544 --> 00:28:03,478
Unhand me, monster!

327
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:05,580
Stop squirming, Arthur.

328
00:28:05,715 --> 00:28:08,047
I'm not Arthur.

329
00:28:10,052 --> 00:28:12,577
I am Lancelot.

330
00:28:12,722 --> 00:28:15,384
That dork over there is Arthur.

331
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:23,659
This is, like, totally embarrassing...

332
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:26,393
...but Tiffany thinkest
thou vex her so soothly.

333
00:28:26,535 --> 00:28:29,936
She thought perchance thou would
ask her to the Homecoming Dance.

334
00:28:30,072 --> 00:28:31,164
Excuse me?

335
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:35,243
Like, whatever. She's into college guys
and mythical creatures.

336
00:28:38,681 --> 00:28:40,774
Oh, Arthur...

337
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:44,613
...come out, come out, wherever you are!

338
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:49,283
You better run,
you little punk no-goodniks!

339
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:52,826
The days of Donkey Dumpy Drawers
are over!

340
00:28:58,934 --> 00:29:00,265
Hold it.

341
00:29:00,936 --> 00:29:02,995
We're here for the mascot contest.

342
00:29:07,676 --> 00:29:10,873
We're here for the mascot contest, too.

343
00:29:11,013 --> 00:29:13,538
This is a costume?

344
00:29:13,682 --> 00:29:15,673
Worked on it all night long.

345
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:18,816
Looks pretty real to me.

346
00:29:18,954 --> 00:29:21,354
If he were real, could I do this?

347
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:24,686
Or this?

348
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:30,830
If it were real, that would have been
agonizingly painful.

349
00:29:30,966 --> 00:29:34,163
- Now watch this!
- That's quite enough, boys.

350
00:29:34,303 --> 00:29:38,103
Thank you to Professor Primbottom
and his lecture...

351
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,639
...on "just say nay" .

352
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:44,842
And now, without further ado, let's give
a warm Worcestershire hoozah...

353
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,472
...to the winner
of our mascot contest, the...

354
00:29:49,652 --> 00:29:50,641
...ogre?

355
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:55,019
That's right. I'm the new mascot.

356
00:29:55,157 --> 00:29:58,786
So let's really try and beat
the other guys at...

357
00:29:58,928 --> 00:30:02,056
...whatever it is they're doing!

358
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:08,593
This is all a bit unorthodox...

359
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:12,400
Where can I find Arthur Pendragon?

360
00:30:14,677 --> 00:30:16,167
Hey, wait...

361
00:30:20,282 --> 00:30:21,909
Olassic.

362
00:30:22,051 --> 00:30:23,746
You should be ashamed of yourself!

363
00:30:23,886 --> 00:30:26,286
I didn't do it. They did.

364
00:30:31,093 --> 00:30:32,822
Please don't eat me.

365
00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:35,294
Eat him! Eat him! Eat him!

366
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:38,960
I'm not here to eat him!

367
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:43,064
Time to pack up
your toothbrush and jammies.

368
00:30:43,205 --> 00:30:45,435
You're the new King of Far Far Away.

369
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:47,235
What?

370
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:52,975
Artie a king?
More like the Mayor of Loserville!

371
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,709
Burn.

372
00:31:02,324 --> 00:31:03,450
Is this for real?

373
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:07,995
Absolutely. Olean out your locker, kid.
You have a kingdom to run.

374
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,792
So, wait...l'm really the only heir?

375
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:13,465
The one and only.

376
00:31:14,803 --> 00:31:16,464
Give me a second.

377
00:31:18,807 --> 00:31:20,468
My good people...

378
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:23,339
...there's a lesson here for all of us.

379
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:27,779
Next time you're about to dunk a kid's
head in a chamber pot, stop and think,

380
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:30,408
" Hey, maybe this guy has feelings.

381
00:31:31,153 --> 00:31:33,519
Maybe I should cut him some slack.

382
00:31:33,656 --> 00:31:37,023
Cause maybe... just maybe...

383
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,856
...this guy's gonna turn out to be,
I don't know, a king?

384
00:31:40,996 --> 00:31:46,024
Maybe his first royal decree will be to
banish everyone who ever picked on him."

385
00:31:46,168 --> 00:31:49,035
I'm looking at you, jousting team!

386
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:52,568
And Guin? Oh, Guin.

387
00:31:53,442 --> 00:31:54,773
I've always loved you.

388
00:31:56,645 --> 00:31:59,205
Good friends, it breaks my heart, but...

389
00:31:59,348 --> 00:32:02,840
...enjoy your stay here in prison
while I rule the free world!

390
00:32:02,985 --> 00:32:04,577
Okay, let's not overdo it.

391
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,053
I'm building my city, people...
on rock 'n ' roll!

392
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,055
You just overdid it.

393
00:32:19,201 --> 00:32:20,828
Look at you!

394
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,494
You look darling.

395
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:24,833
Just precious. Look at her.

396
00:32:24,974 --> 00:32:27,340
Any cravings since you got pregnant?

397
00:32:27,476 --> 00:32:30,104
No. Not at all.

398
00:32:30,946 --> 00:32:32,675
Do you smell ham?

399
00:32:32,815 --> 00:32:35,943
It's present time!

400
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,881
Fiona, please open mine first.
It's the one in front.

401
00:32:42,024 --> 00:32:46,654
" Oongratulations on your new
mess mak..." Oh, mess maker!

402
00:32:46,795 --> 00:32:49,787
" Hopefully this helps.
Love, Oinderella."

403
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:52,794
- Look at that!
- What is it?

404
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,838
It's for the poopies.

405
00:32:56,972 --> 00:32:58,530
Wait... babies poop?

406
00:32:58,674 --> 00:33:00,005
Everyone poops, Beauty.

407
00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:01,609
Fiona!

408
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:04,577
We all chipped in
for a little present, too.

409
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:07,039
Ta-da!

410
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,083
You know the baby will love it,
because I do!

411
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,189
Guys, that's so sweet. Thank you.

412
00:33:14,323 --> 00:33:15,722
Who's this one from?

413
00:33:15,858 --> 00:33:18,793
I got you the biggest one,
because I love you most.

414
00:33:18,927 --> 00:33:21,987
" Have one on me. Love, Snow White."

415
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,460
What is it?

416
00:33:26,602 --> 00:33:28,126
He's a live-in babysitter.

417
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,362
Where's the baby?

418
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:33,566
You're too kind, Snow,
but I can't accept this.

419
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:36,075
It's nothing. I have six more at home.

420
00:33:36,211 --> 00:33:37,974
- What does he do?
- Oleaning.

421
00:33:38,113 --> 00:33:39,705
- Feeding.
- Burping.

422
00:33:39,848 --> 00:33:42,316
So, what are
Shrek and I supposed to do?

423
00:33:42,451 --> 00:33:44,578
Work on your marriage.

424
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,588
Thanks, Rapunzel.
What's that supposed to mean?

425
00:33:48,724 --> 00:33:52,751
Oome on now, Fiona.
You know what happens.

426
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:55,721
You're tired all the time.

427
00:33:55,864 --> 00:33:57,593
You start letting yourself go.

428
00:33:57,733 --> 00:33:58,893
Stretch marks.

429
00:33:59,034 --> 00:34:00,365
Say goodbye to romance.

430
00:34:02,705 --> 00:34:06,141
I'm sorry, but how many
of you have kids?

431
00:34:06,275 --> 00:34:07,833
She's right!

432
00:34:07,976 --> 00:34:12,413
A baby will only strengthen the love
Shrek and Fiona have.

433
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:15,381
How did Shrek react when you told him?

434
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:19,715
When he first found out, Shrek said...

435
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:36,902
Onward, my new friends!
To our happily ever afters!

436
00:34:42,578 --> 00:34:44,739
Now... bombs away!

437
00:35:01,263 --> 00:35:04,130
Well, well, well. If it isn't Peter Pan.

438
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:06,734
- His name's not Peter.
- Shut it, Wendy.

439
00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:28,950
Enough pillaging! To the castle!

440
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:48,776
You go! Take care of the baby!

441
00:35:48,911 --> 00:35:52,074
Everybody stay calm! We're going to die!

442
00:35:56,485 --> 00:35:58,612
Everyone in! Now!

443
00:35:58,754 --> 00:36:00,881
Oome on! Put some back into it!

444
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:05,716
We don't have time. Now go!

445
00:36:05,861 --> 00:36:07,658
Quickly, ladies!

446
00:36:09,932 --> 00:36:11,490
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

447
00:36:27,182 --> 00:36:29,582
Where are Shrek and Fiona?

448
00:36:29,718 --> 00:36:31,879
The name doesn't ring a bell.

449
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,715
No bell.

450
00:36:33,856 --> 00:36:37,223
I suggest you freaks cooperate...

451
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,953
...with the new King of Far Far Away!

452
00:36:40,095 --> 00:36:43,792
The only thing you're ever gonna
be king of is King of the Stupids!

453
00:36:43,932 --> 00:36:46,230
- Hook!
- Right!

454
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:48,598
Avast, ye cookie.

455
00:36:51,206 --> 00:36:52,867
Start talking.

456
00:36:57,246 --> 00:36:58,736
- Gingy!
- Papa!

457
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:00,246
Settle down now.

458
00:37:14,229 --> 00:37:17,528
<i>On the good ship Lollipop</i>

459
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:21,102
<i>It's a sweet trip to the candy shop</i>

460
00:37:21,236 --> 00:37:22,225
You!

461
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:25,266
You can't lie.

462
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:29,070
So tell me, puppet... where is Shrek?

463
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,311
Well... I don't know where he's not.

464
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,645
You don't know where Shrek is?

465
00:37:37,786 --> 00:37:40,380
It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume...

466
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:44,788
...that I couldn't exactly not say that
is or isn't almost partially incorrect.

467
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:46,292
So you do know where he is!

468
00:37:46,428 --> 00:37:48,953
On the contrary,
I'm possibly more or less

469
00:37:49,097 --> 00:37:51,327
not definitely rejecting the idea

470
00:37:51,466 --> 00:37:55,129
that in no way,
with any amount of uncertainty...

471
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,259
Stop it!

472
00:37:56,405 --> 00:37:58,532
...I do not know where he shouldn't be.

473
00:37:58,674 --> 00:38:01,142
If that indeed wasn't where he isn't .

474
00:38:01,276 --> 00:38:04,871
Even if he wasn't not where
I knew he was, it could mean...

475
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:07,243
<i>On the good ship Lollipop</i>

476
00:38:07,382 --> 00:38:11,785
Enough! Shrek went off
to bring back the next heir!

477
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,587
He's bringing back the next heir?

478
00:38:16,725 --> 00:38:18,215
No!

479
00:38:19,461 --> 00:38:22,658
Hook! Get rid of this new " King" .

480
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:24,663
But bring Shrek to me.

481
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,997
I have something special
in mind for him.

482
00:38:28,136 --> 00:38:30,297
He'll never fall for your tricks!

483
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:33,635
Oh, boy.

484
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:46,511
I can't believe it. Me, a king?

485
00:38:46,655 --> 00:38:49,681
I knew I came from royalty, but...

486
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:51,918
...I figured everyone forgot about me.

487
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,791
Oh, no. In fact the King
asked for you personally.

488
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:58,491
Really? Wow.

489
00:38:59,835 --> 00:39:02,065
But I know it's not all fun and games.

490
00:39:02,204 --> 00:39:05,196
It really is
all fun and games, actually.

491
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,935
Sure, you have to knight a few heroes,
launch a ship or two.

492
00:39:09,077 --> 00:39:13,411
By the way, make sure you hit the boat
just right with the bottle.

493
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:16,346
Any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle.

494
00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:20,120
Well, I've heard
it's harder than it looks.

495
00:39:20,255 --> 00:39:22,223
This is going to be huge.

496
00:39:22,357 --> 00:39:27,226
Parties, princesses,
castles. Princesses.

497
00:39:27,362 --> 00:39:30,229
You'll be living in the lap of luxury.

498
00:39:30,365 --> 00:39:32,833
The finest chefs
will wait for your order.

499
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:35,937
And fortunately,
you'll have the royal food tasters.

500
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:37,766
What do they do?

501
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:42,502
Taste the food before the King eats,
to make sure it's not poisoned.

502
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:45,238
- Poisoned?
- Or too salty.

503
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,907
Don't worry. Your bodyguards
will keep you safe.

504
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:51,315
All of them willing
at a moment's notice

505
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:54,286
to lay down their lives
out of devotion to you.

506
00:39:54,423 --> 00:39:55,856
Really?

507
00:39:55,991 --> 00:39:59,017
The whole kingdom will look
to you for wisdom and guidance.

508
00:39:59,394 --> 00:40:01,328
Make sure they don't die of famine!

509
00:40:01,463 --> 00:40:03,192
- Or plague.
- Plague is bad.

510
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:06,232
The coughing, the groaning,
the festering sores.

511
00:40:07,803 --> 00:40:12,240
Festering sores!
You are one funny kitty cat.

512
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:14,307
What did I say?

513
00:40:14,443 --> 00:40:16,809
We don't want Artie
getting the wrong idea.

514
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:18,739
Artie?

515
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:24,781
There goes my hip!

516
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,081
Artie! What are you doing?

517
00:40:29,024 --> 00:40:31,151
What does it look like?!

518
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:36,297
This really isn't up to you.

519
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:39,298
I don't know anything about being king!

520
00:40:39,434 --> 00:40:41,368
You'll learn on the job!

521
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:45,796
Sorry, but I'm going back.

522
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:48,375
Back to what? Being a loser?

523
00:40:51,947 --> 00:40:53,505
Now look what you did!

524
00:40:54,282 --> 00:40:58,116
Look what I did?
Who's holding the wheel, chief?

525
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:00,611
Shrek!

526
00:41:12,968 --> 00:41:14,959
Land ho!

527
00:41:27,482 --> 00:41:29,313
How humiliating.

528
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:33,253
Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

529
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:37,085
Now it's "Your Highness" ?
What happened to " loser" ?

530
00:41:37,225 --> 00:41:40,126
If you think this is getting you
out of anything, it isn't .

531
00:41:40,262 --> 00:41:44,028
We're heading back to Far Far Away
one way or another...

532
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,600
...and you're going to be a father!

533
00:41:46,735 --> 00:41:48,168
What?

534
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:50,562
You just said "father" .

535
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:53,435
King! You're going to be king!

536
00:41:53,575 --> 00:41:56,567
"You're going to be king!" Yeah, right.

537
00:41:57,779 --> 00:41:59,212
Where are you going?

538
00:41:59,347 --> 00:42:01,815
Far Far Away... from you!

539
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,918
Get back here, young man!

540
00:42:05,887 --> 00:42:08,378
Boss? I don't think he's coming back.

541
00:42:08,523 --> 00:42:11,720
Maybe it's for the best.
He's not exactly king material.

542
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:15,091
When did you plan to tell him
you were supposed to be king?

543
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,063
Oome on. Why would I do that?

544
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,260
Besides, he'll be ten times
better at it than me.

545
00:42:21,403 --> 00:42:25,362
Then change your tactics
if you want to get anywhere with him.

546
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:29,540
You're right, Donkey.

547
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,404
What about this?

548
00:42:33,548 --> 00:42:37,382
- Shrek!
- Oome on. It's just a joke.

549
00:42:38,954 --> 00:42:40,285
Still...

550
00:42:57,072 --> 00:42:58,733
Listen, Artie.

551
00:42:59,307 --> 00:43:04,438
If you think this whole mad scene
ain't dope, I feel you, dude.

552
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:08,709
I'm not trying to get up in your grill
or raise your roof.

553
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,977
But what I am screamin' is, yo...

554
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,316
...check out this
kazing thazing, bazaby!

555
00:43:14,456 --> 00:43:16,549
If it doesn't groove, or what I'm saying

556
00:43:16,691 --> 00:43:19,626
ain't straight trippin',
say, " Oh, no, you didn't !

557
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:22,195
You're getting on my last nerve."

558
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:25,322
And then I'll know it's ...
I'll know it's wack!

559
00:43:26,935 --> 00:43:28,129
Help!

560
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:31,671
I've been kidnapped by a monster
who's trying to relate to me!

561
00:43:31,806 --> 00:43:35,435
- Artie, wait.
- Oome on! Help! Hello?

562
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:40,642
Greetings, cosmic children
of the universe.

563
00:43:40,782 --> 00:43:42,716
Welcome to my serenity circle.

564
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:46,981
Please leave any bad vibes
outside the healing vortex.

565
00:43:47,122 --> 00:43:48,953
Now prepare to...

566
00:43:54,629 --> 00:43:57,462
I knew I should have got that warranty!

567
00:44:00,368 --> 00:44:01,835
Mr. Merlin?

568
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,437
You know this guy?

569
00:44:03,571 --> 00:44:07,837
Yeah. He was the school magic teacher,
until he had his nervous breakdown.

570
00:44:07,976 --> 00:44:11,343
Technically, I was merely a victim
of a level 3 fatigue.

571
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:13,572
At the request of my therapist,

572
00:44:13,715 --> 00:44:17,344
and the school authorities, I retired
to the tranquility of nature

573
00:44:17,485 --> 00:44:19,646
to discover my divine purpose.

574
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:24,557
Oan I interest anyone
in a snack or beverage?

575
00:44:24,693 --> 00:44:25,785
Uh, no.

576
00:44:25,927 --> 00:44:29,260
Sure you don't want to try
my Rock Au Gratin?

577
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:33,634
It's organic.

578
00:44:33,768 --> 00:44:36,202
Thanks. I ate a boulder on the way in.

579
00:44:36,338 --> 00:44:39,273
We need directions to Far Far Away.

580
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:41,932
"We" ? Who said I was going with you?

581
00:44:42,077 --> 00:44:46,446
I did. People are counting on you,
so don't try to weasel out of it.

582
00:44:46,581 --> 00:44:48,640
If the job's so great, you do it.

583
00:44:49,184 --> 00:44:53,450
Understand this, kid. No more
Mr. Nice Guy from here on out.

584
00:44:53,588 --> 00:44:55,886
That was your Mr. Nice Guy?

585
00:44:56,024 --> 00:44:57,958
Yeah, and I'm going to miss him.

586
00:44:58,093 --> 00:45:02,496
Why don't you go terrorize a village
and leave me alone!

587
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:07,158
Was that a crack about ogres? You get
your royal highness to Far Far Away...

588
00:45:07,302 --> 00:45:11,329
...before I kick it there!
Now, which way am I kicking?

589
00:45:11,473 --> 00:45:13,304
I could tell you, but since you're

590
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:15,966
in the midst
of a self-destructive rage spiral,

591
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:18,636
it would be karmically irresponsible.

592
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,443
Self-destructive...?
Are you going to help us or not?

593
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:25,178
Most definitely, but only after you

594
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,517
take the journey to your soul!

595
00:45:28,656 --> 00:45:30,021
I don't think so.

596
00:45:30,158 --> 00:45:33,992
It's either that
or primal scream therapy.

597
00:45:36,064 --> 00:45:38,726
All right. Journey to the soul.

598
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:41,432
Now, all of you,

599
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:44,094
look into the Fire of Truth

600
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:47,231
and tell me what you see.

601
00:45:50,078 --> 00:45:51,943
Ooh, charades!

602
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,847
Okay, I see a Dutch fudge torte
with cinnamon swirls!

603
00:45:56,985 --> 00:45:59,579
Okay, monster... go for it.

604
00:46:08,263 --> 00:46:09,958
I see a rainbow pony.

605
00:46:10,098 --> 00:46:12,032
Excellent work! Now the boy.

606
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:13,634
This is lame.

607
00:46:13,768 --> 00:46:16,032
You're lame! Now just go for it.

608
00:46:17,605 --> 00:46:18,936
Okay.

609
00:46:19,774 --> 00:46:24,211
There's a baby bird and a father bird
sitting in a nest.

610
00:46:24,345 --> 00:46:26,336
Yes! Stay with it!

611
00:46:27,182 --> 00:46:31,175
The dad just flew away. Why did
he leave the little bird all alone?

612
00:46:31,853 --> 00:46:35,289
It's trying to fly,
but it doesn't know how to.

613
00:46:36,191 --> 00:46:38,352
It's going to fall!

614
00:46:43,198 --> 00:46:47,191
Proper head case you are.
Really messed up.

615
00:46:50,538 --> 00:46:55,532
Okay, I get it. The bird's me.
My dad left. So what?

616
00:47:07,555 --> 00:47:10,217
Look, Artie, um...

617
00:47:14,562 --> 00:47:17,326
Just thought I'd help set the mood...

618
00:47:17,465 --> 00:47:20,798
...for your big heart-to-heart chat.

619
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:32,577
I know what it's like
to not feel ready for something.

620
00:47:34,916 --> 00:47:37,248
Even ogres get scared.

621
00:47:38,086 --> 00:47:40,919
You know... once in a while.

622
00:47:42,924 --> 00:47:46,690
I know you want me
to be king, but I can't .

623
00:47:46,828 --> 00:47:49,695
I'm not cut out for it,
and I never will be.

624
00:47:50,598 --> 00:47:53,089
Even my own dad knew
I wasn't worth the trouble.

625
00:47:53,234 --> 00:47:56,431
He dumped me at that school
first chance he got...

626
00:47:57,105 --> 00:47:59,437
...and I never heard from him again.

627
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:04,943
My dad wasn't really
the fatherly type, either.

628
00:48:05,446 --> 00:48:07,607
I doubt he was worse than mine.

629
00:48:08,449 --> 00:48:09,746
Oh, yeah?

630
00:48:09,884 --> 00:48:13,945
My father was an ogre.
He tried to eat me.

631
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:16,984
I guess I should have realized it.

632
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:21,391
He bathed me in barbecue sauce and
put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.

633
00:48:23,298 --> 00:48:25,789
I guess that's pretty bad.

634
00:48:28,136 --> 00:48:30,331
It may be hard to believe,

635
00:48:30,471 --> 00:48:33,929
what, with my obvious charm
and good looks,

636
00:48:34,075 --> 00:48:37,010
but people used
to think I was a monster.

637
00:48:37,145 --> 00:48:40,808
And for a long time, I believed them.

638
00:48:42,817 --> 00:48:44,409
But after a while,

639
00:48:44,552 --> 00:48:48,079
you learn to ignore
the names people call you

640
00:48:48,223 --> 00:48:50,555
and just trust who you are.

641
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,823
You know... you're okay, Shrek.

642
00:48:56,664 --> 00:49:00,225
You just need to do a little less
yelling and use a little more soap.

643
00:49:01,569 --> 00:49:03,196
Thanks, Artie.

644
00:49:03,338 --> 00:49:07,001
The soap's because
you stink... really bad.

645
00:49:08,176 --> 00:49:10,667
Yeah... I got that.

646
00:49:14,682 --> 00:49:17,549
This place is filthy!

647
00:49:17,852 --> 00:49:19,444
I feel like a hobo.

648
00:49:20,688 --> 00:49:23,452
I'm sorry, but this
isn't working for me.

649
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:28,153
Everything's always about you.
It's not like your attitude is helping.

650
00:49:28,296 --> 00:49:31,993
Maybe itjust bothers you
I was voted fairest in the land.

651
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:34,226
You mean in that rigged election?

652
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:37,338
Give me a break. " Rapunzel, Rapunzel...

653
00:49:37,472 --> 00:49:40,600
...let down thy golden extensions!"

654
00:49:40,742 --> 00:49:45,543
Ladies, let go of your petty complaints
and let's work together!

655
00:49:48,516 --> 00:49:51,508
So I guess the plan is
we just wander aimlessly

656
00:49:51,653 --> 00:49:53,746
in this stinkhole until we rot.

657
00:49:53,888 --> 00:49:57,415
No, we get inside and find out
what Oharming's up to.

658
00:49:57,558 --> 00:50:00,254
I know he's a jerk and everything,

659
00:50:00,395 --> 00:50:04,559
but that Oharming
makes me hotter than July.

660
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,231
That's it!

661
00:50:35,263 --> 00:50:37,629
Oome on! This way!

662
00:50:37,765 --> 00:50:38,754
Rapunzel, wait!

663
00:50:48,276 --> 00:50:50,107
Oharming, let go of her.

664
00:50:50,244 --> 00:50:52,872
But why would I want to do that?

665
00:50:58,419 --> 00:50:59,408
What?

666
00:50:59,554 --> 00:51:04,651
Say hello, ladies,
to the new Queen of Far Far Away.

667
00:51:08,663 --> 00:51:10,460
Rapunzel, how could you?

668
00:51:10,598 --> 00:51:12,862
Jealous much?

669
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,434
Soon you'll be back
where you started,

670
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:18,198
scrubbing floors
or locked away in towers.

671
00:51:18,339 --> 00:51:21,968
That is, if I let you last the week.

672
00:51:24,278 --> 00:51:26,872
Pookie, you promised not to hurt them.

673
00:51:27,014 --> 00:51:31,007
Not here, kitten whiskers.
Daddy will discuss it later.

674
00:51:31,753 --> 00:51:34,278
Now forgive us.
We have a show to put on.

675
00:51:34,422 --> 00:51:37,687
Shrek will be back soon,
and you'll be sorry.

676
00:51:37,825 --> 00:51:39,224
Sorry?!

677
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,626
Don't you realize once Shrek
sets foot in Far Far Away...

678
00:51:43,765 --> 00:51:45,528
...he's doomed?

679
00:52:25,072 --> 00:52:26,699
Look out! They got a piano!

680
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:30,208
Kill them all... except the fat one.

681
00:52:30,344 --> 00:52:34,713
King Oharming has something special
in mind for you, ogre.

682
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:36,146
King Oharming?

683
00:52:36,284 --> 00:52:37,308
Attack!

684
00:52:43,591 --> 00:52:44,751
Artie, duck!

685
00:52:59,307 --> 00:53:00,569
Ready the plank!

686
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,951
- Shrek!
- Help!

687
00:53:37,278 --> 00:53:38,575
Oowards!

688
00:53:38,713 --> 00:53:41,079
What has Oharming done with Fiona?

689
00:53:41,215 --> 00:53:43,809
She's going to get what's coming to her.

690
00:53:44,385 --> 00:53:49,288
And there ain't nothing
you can do to stop him!

691
00:53:49,423 --> 00:53:51,948
- We've got to save her.
- But she's so far far away!

692
00:53:52,894 --> 00:53:55,192
Get yourself back
to Worcestershire, kid.

693
00:53:55,329 --> 00:53:58,821
No, Shrek. Hold on. I've got an idea.

694
00:53:58,966 --> 00:54:01,230
I am a buzzing bee.

695
00:54:01,903 --> 00:54:05,100
Mr. Merlin?
They need a spell to get them...

696
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:08,265
...I mean us, back to Far Far Away.

697
00:54:08,409 --> 00:54:11,845
Forget it. I don't have that kind
of magic in me anymore.

698
00:54:11,979 --> 00:54:15,676
How about a hug?
That's the best kind of magic.

699
00:54:15,816 --> 00:54:18,182
Please. I know you can do it.

700
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,116
I said forget it!

701
00:54:20,254 --> 00:54:21,585
But...

702
00:54:28,996 --> 00:54:30,588
What's with you?

703
00:54:31,933 --> 00:54:35,096
It's just so hard, you know?

704
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:39,900
They need to get back,
cause their kingdom's in trouble.

705
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:42,566
Cause there's a really bad man.

706
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,473
It's just so hard!

707
00:54:44,612 --> 00:54:46,739
Take it easy.

708
00:54:46,881 --> 00:54:50,248
No! I don't think you understand!

709
00:54:50,384 --> 00:54:54,912
There's a mean person doing
mean things to good people.

710
00:54:55,056 --> 00:54:56,751
Have a heart, old man.

711
00:54:56,891 --> 00:55:01,055
They really need your help to get back.
Why won't you help them?!

712
00:55:04,899 --> 00:55:06,491
Okay.

713
00:55:06,634 --> 00:55:08,625
I'll go get my things.

714
00:55:11,405 --> 00:55:12,599
Piece of cake.

715
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:16,267
Well, well. You want eggs with that ham?

716
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:20,107
I am a little rusty, so there
could be some side effects.

717
00:55:20,247 --> 00:55:21,714
- Side effects?
- Don't worry.

718
00:55:21,849 --> 00:55:25,615
Whatever it is, no matter
how excruciatingly painful,

719
00:55:25,753 --> 00:55:28,916
it will wear off eventually. I think.

720
00:55:30,891 --> 00:55:33,121
- Oops.
- You sure about this?

721
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:37,390
If Artie trusts him,
that's good enough for me.

722
00:55:37,531 --> 00:55:39,396
Even if his robe doesn't cover...

723
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:42,058
Alacritious expeditious...

724
00:55:42,203 --> 00:55:44,899
...a-zoomy-zoom-zoom!

725
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:47,872
Let's help our friends get back...

726
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:51,942
...soon!

727
00:55:59,286 --> 00:56:00,878
It worked!

728
00:56:09,597 --> 00:56:12,623
I haven't been on a trip
like that since college!

729
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:14,329
Donkey?

730
00:56:14,468 --> 00:56:17,301
What? Is something in my teeth?

731
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:24,734
Oh, no! I've been abracadabra-ed into
a Fancy Feastin', second-rate sidekick!

732
00:56:27,081 --> 00:56:31,142
At least you don't look
like some kind of bloated piñata!

733
00:56:31,285 --> 00:56:33,344
You should think about going on a diet!

734
00:56:33,487 --> 00:56:38,083
You should get yourself a pair of pants.
I feel all exposed and nasty!

735
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,092
So you two think this is funny?

736
00:56:44,598 --> 00:56:46,395
I'm really sorry, guys.

737
00:56:46,534 --> 00:56:49,002
Don't be. You got us back, kid.

738
00:56:54,675 --> 00:56:56,802
How in the Hans Ohristian Andersen

739
00:56:56,944 --> 00:56:59,708
am I supposed to parade around
in these goofy boots?

740
00:56:59,847 --> 00:57:02,680
Hey, hey, hey!
Be very careful with those.

741
00:57:04,118 --> 00:57:07,451
They were made in Madrid
by the finest...

742
00:57:08,122 --> 00:57:10,113
You'll learn to control that.

743
00:57:13,027 --> 00:57:18,021
Seriously. Ow! You need some comfort
inserts or arch supports or something.

744
00:57:24,205 --> 00:57:29,074
Watch it. I'm walking here
and I'm gonna keep going until...

745
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:30,302
Pinocchio!

746
00:57:31,045 --> 00:57:33,070
Shrek! Help me!

747
00:57:33,214 --> 00:57:36,411
- What happened?
- Oharming and the villains took over!

748
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:40,316
Fiona and the Princesses got away.
Now she's ...

749
00:57:40,454 --> 00:57:41,978
She's what?! What?!

750
00:57:44,325 --> 00:57:46,156
Puss! Loan me five bucks.

751
00:57:46,293 --> 00:57:48,523
You heard him. Help the brother out.

752
00:57:48,662 --> 00:57:50,755
Do you see any pockets on me?

753
00:57:50,898 --> 00:57:52,729
Hold on a second.

754
00:57:55,236 --> 00:57:59,400
I had no idea, really. I... I swear.

755
00:58:00,574 --> 00:58:02,769
Quick! Where is Fiona?

756
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:06,676
Oharming has her locked away
someplace. You have to find him!

757
00:58:06,814 --> 00:58:09,681
He's probably getting ready
for the show!

758
00:58:09,817 --> 00:58:12,149
Wait, Pinocchio! What show?

759
00:58:17,158 --> 00:58:19,558
" It's a Happily Ever After After All" .

760
00:58:19,693 --> 00:58:22,025
" Shrek's final performance" ?

761
00:58:22,163 --> 00:58:26,293
Shrek! You didn't tell us
you were in a play!

762
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:29,891
I guess I've been so busy
I forgot to mention it.

763
00:58:30,037 --> 00:58:31,595
The ogre! Get him!

764
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,272
<i>Don't worry, jefe. I got this.</i>

765
00:58:41,816 --> 00:58:43,443
Uck! Kill it!

766
00:58:44,451 --> 00:58:49,582
Look. Don't you know who
he thinks he is? How dare you!

767
00:58:49,723 --> 00:58:51,247
We're dealing with amateurs.

768
00:58:51,392 --> 00:58:56,329
He's a star, people! Hello?
I'm so sorry about this, Mr. Shrek.

769
00:58:56,463 --> 00:58:57,987
I'm going to lose it!

770
00:58:58,132 --> 00:59:01,932
Is everything ready? You did get
the list for the dressing room?

771
00:59:02,069 --> 00:59:05,163
Breakfast croissant stuffed
with seared sashimi tuna.

772
00:59:05,306 --> 00:59:08,605
And I hope you have the saffron corn
with jalapeno honey butter.

773
00:59:08,742 --> 00:59:11,734
Our client cannot get
into his proper emotional state

774
00:59:11,879 --> 00:59:13,676
withoutjalapeno honey butter!

775
00:59:13,814 --> 00:59:15,213
I just lost it.

776
00:59:15,983 --> 00:59:18,508
They should talk to Nancy
in Human Resources.

777
00:59:18,652 --> 00:59:22,144
Oh, we will have much to say
to Nancy, I promise!

778
00:59:23,824 --> 00:59:27,521
"With this sword, I do..." No. "With..."

779
00:59:27,661 --> 00:59:31,324
"With this sword, I do smote thee!"

780
00:59:32,233 --> 00:59:34,701
Is " smote" the right word? " Smoot" ?

781
00:59:34,835 --> 00:59:36,700
I don't think that's a word.

782
00:59:36,837 --> 00:59:41,171
Maybe I should just " smite" him.
Let's try this again. Now...

783
00:59:42,343 --> 00:59:45,506
Shrek attacks me.
I pretend to be afraid.

784
00:59:46,247 --> 00:59:50,650
" Now the kingdom will get the happily
ever after they deserve. Die, ogre!"

785
00:59:50,784 --> 00:59:54,447
Blah, blah, blah. Oh,
itjust doesn't feel real enough!

786
00:59:56,357 --> 00:59:58,382
Who told you to stop dancing?!

787
00:59:58,525 --> 00:59:59,992
Wink and turn.

788
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:03,358
What are you laying around for?
Get up! Honestly!

789
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:15,236
Our happily ever after
is nearly complete, Mummy.

790
01:00:15,376 --> 01:00:17,571
And I assure you...

791
01:00:17,711 --> 01:00:22,705
...the people of this kingdom
will pay dearly for every second...

792
01:00:23,884 --> 01:00:25,545
...we've had to wait.

793
01:00:27,154 --> 01:00:28,587
Break a leg.

794
01:00:28,722 --> 01:00:31,486
On second thought,
let me break it for you.

795
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:35,925
Thank goodness. I was afraid
you wouldn't get back in time.

796
01:00:36,063 --> 01:00:37,690
Where's Fiona?

797
01:00:37,831 --> 01:00:42,063
Don't worry. She and the others
are safe... for now.

798
01:00:51,245 --> 01:00:54,578
Let me guess. Arthur.

799
01:00:55,249 --> 01:00:57,274
It's Artie, actually.

800
01:00:57,418 --> 01:01:02,412
This boy is supposed to be
the new King of Far Far Away?

801
01:01:04,325 --> 01:01:05,622
How pathetic.

802
01:01:05,759 --> 01:01:08,626
Stand still, so I won't make a mess.

803
01:01:08,762 --> 01:01:12,198
Oharming, stop! I'm here now.
You got what you wanted.

804
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:13,994
This isn't about him.

805
01:01:14,768 --> 01:01:19,102
Then who's it about?
I'm supposed to be king, right?

806
01:01:20,441 --> 01:01:24,810
You weren't really next in line
for the throne.

807
01:01:24,945 --> 01:01:26,344
I was.

808
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,813
But you said the King
asked for me personally.

809
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,781
Not exactly.

810
01:01:31,919 --> 01:01:33,352
What does that mean?

811
01:01:33,487 --> 01:01:35,978
I said whatever I had to say, all right?

812
01:01:36,123 --> 01:01:39,820
I wasn't right for the job,
so I needed some fool to replace me.

813
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,623
And you fit the bill. So just go!

814
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,759
You were playing me the whole time.

815
01:01:48,902 --> 01:01:50,665
You catch on real fast, kid.

816
01:01:50,804 --> 01:01:53,898
Maybe you're not
as big of a loser as I thought.

817
01:02:00,314 --> 01:02:02,680
You know, for a minute...

818
01:02:02,816 --> 01:02:04,716
- ...I actually thought...
- What?

819
01:02:04,852 --> 01:02:08,344
That he cared about you? He's an ogre.

820
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:10,320
What did you expect?

821
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:24,327
You really do have a way
with children, Shrek.

822
01:02:36,683 --> 01:02:40,483
<i>Leave me out with the waste</i>

823
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:43,556
<i>This is not what I do</i>

824
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:47,387
<i>It's the wrong time</i>

825
01:02:47,528 --> 01:02:50,224
<i>She's pulling me through</i>

826
01:02:50,364 --> 01:02:54,061
<i>It's a small crime</i>

827
01:02:54,201 --> 01:02:56,829
<i>And I got no excuse</i>

828
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:59,370
<i>And is that all right, yeah?</i>

829
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:02,866
<i>Is that all right with you?</i>

830
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:08,044
<i>Is that all right, yeah?</i>

831
01:03:08,549 --> 01:03:12,542
<i>If I give my gun away when it's loaded?</i>

832
01:03:14,721 --> 01:03:19,385
<i>If you don't shoot it
how am I supposed to hold it?</i>

833
01:03:22,563 --> 01:03:25,430
<i>Is that all right?
Is that all right?</i>

834
01:03:25,566 --> 01:03:29,002
<i>Is that all right with you?</i>

835
01:03:29,136 --> 01:03:30,001
<i>No.</i>

836
01:03:30,337 --> 01:03:32,168
Had we stayed put like I suggested,

837
01:03:32,306 --> 01:03:35,104
we'd be sipping tea
out of little heart-shaped cups.

838
01:03:35,242 --> 01:03:36,766
Yeah, heart-shaped cups.

839
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:39,538
And eating crumpets
smothered with loganberries.

840
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,272
Yeah, loganberries.

841
01:03:41,415 --> 01:03:43,280
- Shut up, Oindy.
- Yeah, shut up.

842
01:03:43,417 --> 01:03:46,284
- No, you shut up.
- Stay out of this.

843
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:49,218
Who cares who's " running the kingdom" ?

844
01:03:49,356 --> 01:03:52,587
- I care.
- You should all care.

845
01:03:56,563 --> 01:03:59,464
I have your badge number, tin can!

846
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,465
- Donkey?
- Princess!

847
01:04:01,602 --> 01:04:02,591
Puss?

848
01:04:02,736 --> 01:04:06,797
I am Puss, stuck here
inside this hideous body.

849
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:07,964
And I'm me!

850
01:04:08,108 --> 01:04:09,234
But you're...

851
01:04:09,376 --> 01:04:12,038
Everything's fruity in the loops,
but what happened is

852
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:14,147
we went to high school,
the boat crashed

853
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:16,841
and we got bippity-boppity-booped
by the magic man.

854
01:04:16,984 --> 01:04:19,179
You poor sweet things.

855
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:20,718
I don't get it.

856
01:04:20,854 --> 01:04:24,585
The cat turned into a little horse
that smells like feet. What's to get?

857
01:04:24,725 --> 01:04:26,090
Who dat?

858
01:04:26,226 --> 01:04:27,250
Where's Shrek?

859
01:04:27,394 --> 01:04:31,387
Oharming has him. He plans to kill Shrek
tonight in front of the whole kingdom!

860
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:36,963
All right, everyone.
We need to find a way out now.

861
01:04:37,104 --> 01:04:40,631
You're right.
Ladies, assume the position!

862
01:04:45,512 --> 01:04:46,706
What are you doing?

863
01:04:47,481 --> 01:04:48,846
Waiting to be rescued.

864
01:04:48,982 --> 01:04:50,950
You've got to be kidding me.

865
01:04:51,084 --> 01:04:53,848
What else can we do? We're just four...

866
01:04:53,987 --> 01:04:57,286
...I mean three, super-hot princesses...

867
01:04:57,424 --> 01:05:01,485
...two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre
and an old lady!

868
01:05:02,329 --> 01:05:06,663
Excuse me. Old lady coming through.

869
01:05:15,275 --> 01:05:17,072
Mom!

870
01:05:17,211 --> 01:05:21,477
You didn't think you got your fighting
skills from your father, did you?

871
01:05:21,615 --> 01:05:24,345
Excuse me. There's still one more.

872
01:05:34,528 --> 01:05:36,860
Why don't you just lie down?

873
01:05:39,533 --> 01:05:42,400
Okay, girls, from here on out...

874
01:05:42,536 --> 01:05:45,004
...we take care of business ourselves.

875
01:06:02,055 --> 01:06:06,583
<i>The Far Far Away Theatre at the
Charming Pavilion is proud to present...</i>

876
01:06:06,727 --> 01:06:08,490
<i>..."It's A Happily Ever After
After AII."</i>

877
01:06:08,629 --> 01:06:11,928
Enjoy your evening
of theatrical reverie, citizen.

878
01:06:12,065 --> 01:06:15,398
Oi! No food or beverages in the theater!

879
01:06:29,249 --> 01:06:30,614
Places, everyone!

880
01:06:35,756 --> 01:06:36,882
Easy!

881
01:06:37,024 --> 01:06:40,926
Sorry. I was showing off
for the little one.

882
01:06:41,662 --> 01:06:45,257
It's Bring Your Kids to Work Day.
Oome here, beautiful.

883
01:06:48,435 --> 01:06:51,427
Well, she's got your eye.

884
01:06:52,673 --> 01:06:57,610
Who would have thought a monster like
me deserved something as special as you?

885
01:07:39,286 --> 01:07:42,312
<i>Little birdies, take wing</i>

886
01:07:43,156 --> 01:07:45,784
<i>Flitting down from the trees they appear</i>

887
01:07:45,926 --> 01:07:48,394
<i>And to chirp in my ear</i>

888
01:07:49,663 --> 01:07:52,655
<i>All because I sing</i>

889
01:08:22,295 --> 01:08:23,353
Move it! Go!

890
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,699
My babies!

891
01:08:32,706 --> 01:08:33,695
Help!

892
01:09:19,252 --> 01:09:21,243
Hey, how's it goin'

893
01:09:31,932 --> 01:09:33,866
O to the K. The coast is clear.

894
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,628
Let's do this. Go, Team Dynamite!

895
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:40,604
I thought we agreed to use the name
Team Super Oool.

896
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,970
I recall it was Team Awesome.

897
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:45,043
I voted for Team Alpha Wolf Squadron.

898
01:09:45,178 --> 01:09:47,146
Okay! From henceforth,

899
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:51,410
we will be Team Alpha Super Awesome
Oool Dynamite Wolf Squadron.

900
01:09:51,551 --> 01:09:55,783
<i>Ach de liebe! There is some strange
little girl over there staring at us!</i>

901
01:09:56,723 --> 01:09:58,088
Artie!

902
01:09:58,225 --> 01:09:59,590
Wait, wait!

903
01:09:59,726 --> 01:10:01,921
<i>Where is the fire, señor?</i>

904
01:10:02,062 --> 01:10:04,087
Please. Don't act so innocent.

905
01:10:04,231 --> 01:10:07,997
You both knew what was going on
and kept it to yourselves.

906
01:10:08,134 --> 01:10:09,726
It's not like it seems.

907
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:12,703
It's not? I think it seems pretty clear.

908
01:10:12,839 --> 01:10:15,364
He was using me. That's all.

909
01:10:15,509 --> 01:10:17,943
Using you? You really don't get it.

910
01:10:18,078 --> 01:10:21,070
Shrek only said
those things to protect you.

911
01:10:21,748 --> 01:10:26,412
Oharming was going to kill you, Artie!
Shrek saved your life.

912
01:10:36,997 --> 01:10:38,589
Oue the spot!

913
01:10:42,435 --> 01:10:44,960
<i>I wait alone up here</i>

914
01:10:45,105 --> 01:10:47,801
<i>I'm trapped another day</i>

915
01:10:47,941 --> 01:10:51,138
<i>Locked up here, please set me free</i>

916
01:10:51,278 --> 01:10:54,304
<i>My new life I almost see</i>

917
01:10:54,447 --> 01:10:57,143
<i>A castle, you and me</i>

918
01:10:57,284 --> 01:11:02,381
<i>Yes, a castle, you and me</i>

919
01:11:04,457 --> 01:11:05,515
Oherubs!

920
01:11:09,462 --> 01:11:13,262
<i>Tis I, Tis I
Upon my regal steed</i>

921
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,027
<i>Princess, my love</i>

922
01:11:15,168 --> 01:11:17,932
<i>At last you shall be freed
I'm strong</i>

923
01:11:18,071 --> 01:11:20,039
<i>And brave
And dashing my way there</i>

924
01:11:20,473 --> 01:11:26,139
<i>With speed! With might!
With soft and bouncy hair!</i>

925
01:11:27,113 --> 01:11:30,879
<i>- Through the blistering desert
- Hot!</i>

926
01:11:31,017 --> 01:11:34,043
<i>- Across the stormiest sea
- Wet!</i>

927
01:11:34,187 --> 01:11:36,178
<i>Facing creatures so vile</i>

928
01:11:36,323 --> 01:11:37,449
<i>Foul!</i>

929
01:11:37,591 --> 01:11:41,721
<i>So you can gaze upon me!</i>

930
01:11:43,029 --> 01:11:45,361
<i>I knew you'd come for me</i>

931
01:11:45,498 --> 01:11:49,332
<i>And now we finally meet</i>

932
01:11:49,469 --> 01:11:50,936
<i>I knew you'd wait</i>

933
01:11:51,071 --> 01:11:55,599
<i>And from my plate of love you'd eat</i>

934
01:12:15,528 --> 01:12:18,861
<i>Who is this terribly ugly fiend
Who so rudely intervened?</i>

935
01:12:18,999 --> 01:12:20,830
<i>Will Charming fight or flee?</i>

936
01:12:20,967 --> 01:12:22,025
<i>Please rescue me!</i>

937
01:12:22,168 --> 01:12:23,863
<i>From this monstrosity!</i>

938
01:12:24,004 --> 01:12:29,032
<i>Fear thee not, honey lamb!
I will slice this thing up like a ham!</i>

939
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:31,677
Oh, boy.

940
01:12:31,811 --> 01:12:35,406
<i>You are about to enter a world of pain</i>

941
01:12:35,548 --> 01:12:39,882
<i>With which you are not familiar!</i>

942
01:12:43,323 --> 01:12:47,726
It can't be any more painful
than your lousy performance.

943
01:12:51,398 --> 01:12:53,389
" Prepare, foul beast."

944
01:12:55,502 --> 01:12:58,767
Prepare, foul beast, your time is done!

945
01:12:58,905 --> 01:13:02,068
Oould you kill me and then sing?

946
01:13:03,576 --> 01:13:05,271
Be quiet!

947
01:13:05,412 --> 01:13:09,542
I'm just having fun with you.
That's actually a very nice leotard.

948
01:13:09,683 --> 01:13:10,945
Thank you.

949
01:13:11,084 --> 01:13:13,177
Do they come in men's sizes?

950
01:13:16,256 --> 01:13:17,985
Now that be funny!

951
01:13:18,124 --> 01:13:20,092
Enough!

952
01:13:22,495 --> 01:13:26,295
Now you'll finally
know what it's like...

953
01:13:26,433 --> 01:13:29,960
...to have everything you worked for...

954
01:13:30,103 --> 01:13:34,130
...everything that's precious to you,
taken away.

955
01:13:34,274 --> 01:13:37,607
Now you'll know how I felt.

956
01:13:44,951 --> 01:13:46,612
Sausage roll!

957
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:06,495
Pray for mercy from Puss!

958
01:14:06,639 --> 01:14:08,129
And Donkey!

959
01:14:08,341 --> 01:14:09,399
D

960
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:21,682
Hi, honey.

961
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:24,847
Sorry we're late. You okay?

962
01:14:24,991 --> 01:14:27,323
Much better, now that you're here.

963
01:14:29,996 --> 01:14:35,195
So, Oharming, you want to let me out of
these so we can settle this ogre-to-man?

964
01:14:35,335 --> 01:14:39,669
Ooh, that sounds fun.
But I have a better idea.

965
01:14:55,522 --> 01:14:57,922
No! Let go of me!

966
01:14:58,057 --> 01:15:02,187
You will not ruin things
this time, ogre. Kill it.

967
01:15:06,032 --> 01:15:07,795
Everybody, stop!

968
01:15:09,636 --> 01:15:11,729
Oh, what is it now?!

969
01:15:11,871 --> 01:15:13,133
Artie?

970
01:15:22,816 --> 01:15:25,284
Who thinks we need
to settle things this way?

971
01:15:29,556 --> 01:15:33,253
You mean you want to be villains
your whole lives?

972
01:15:33,393 --> 01:15:37,193
But we are villains!
It's the only thing we know.

973
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:39,764
You never wish
you could be something else?

974
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:43,357
Easy for you to say. You're not
some evil enchanted tree.

975
01:15:43,503 --> 01:15:46,267
You morons! Don't listen to him! Attack!

976
01:15:46,406 --> 01:15:49,204
What Steve means is
it's hard to come by honest work

977
01:15:49,342 --> 01:15:51,367
when the whole world's against you.

978
01:15:51,511 --> 01:15:53,240
Right. Thanks, Ed.

979
01:15:53,379 --> 01:15:57,782
Fair enough. You're right.
I'm not a talking tree.

980
01:15:57,917 --> 01:15:59,009
But you know...

981
01:15:59,152 --> 01:16:02,280
...a good friend once told me...

982
01:16:02,422 --> 01:16:07,450
...just because people treat you
like a villain, or an ogre...

983
01:16:07,594 --> 01:16:09,585
...orjust some loser...

984
01:16:11,097 --> 01:16:12,997
...doesn't mean you are one.

985
01:16:15,869 --> 01:16:19,737
What matters most
is what you think of yourself.

986
01:16:19,873 --> 01:16:24,173
If there's something you really want,
or someone you want to be...

987
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:27,939
...the only person standing
in your way is you.

988
01:16:28,448 --> 01:16:30,211
- Me?
- Get him!

989
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:31,749
No, no, no!

990
01:16:31,885 --> 01:16:34,820
What I mean is each of you...

991
01:16:34,954 --> 01:16:37,218
...is standing in your own way.

992
01:16:41,127 --> 01:16:43,618
I always wanted to play the flute.

993
01:16:43,763 --> 01:16:47,426
I'd like to open up a spa... in France!

994
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:52,129
I grow daffodils. And they're beautiful.

995
01:17:40,853 --> 01:17:44,016
A new era finally begins!

996
01:17:45,858 --> 01:17:47,519
Now all of you...

997
01:17:48,361 --> 01:17:50,761
...bow before your King!

998
01:17:57,203 --> 01:17:59,535
You need to work on your aim.

999
01:18:01,874 --> 01:18:04,741
This was supposed to be
my happily ever after!

1000
01:18:04,877 --> 01:18:07,368
Well, you need to keep looking...

1001
01:18:09,382 --> 01:18:11,441
...because I'm not giving up mine.

1002
01:18:16,723 --> 01:18:17,883
Mommy?

1003
01:18:29,235 --> 01:18:31,396
It's yours if you want it.

1004
01:18:32,071 --> 01:18:34,403
But this time it's your choice.

1005
01:18:57,096 --> 01:18:58,120
Author!

1006
01:18:58,264 --> 01:19:01,597
Artie! Artie! Artie! Artie!

1007
01:19:05,938 --> 01:19:08,930
Excuse me. That's my seat.

1008
01:19:09,942 --> 01:19:14,709
<i>Okay, Señor Hocusy-Pocusy, the time
has come to rectify some wrongs!</i>

1009
01:19:14,847 --> 01:19:17,372
Though I have been enjoying
these cat baths.

1010
01:19:17,517 --> 01:19:19,007
Please say you didn't .

1011
01:19:19,152 --> 01:19:21,052
All right! Look.

1012
01:19:21,187 --> 01:19:24,486
You'll feel a pinch and possibly
lower intestinal discomfort...

1013
01:19:24,624 --> 01:19:26,956
...but this should do the trick.

1014
01:19:31,197 --> 01:19:33,665
- Are you...?
- I'm me again!

1015
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,064
- And I am not you!
- All right!

1016
01:19:37,637 --> 01:19:38,797
Oops.

1017
01:19:40,807 --> 01:19:42,206
Ah, never mind.

1018
01:19:46,212 --> 01:19:50,273
What did I tell you?
The kid's going to be a great king.

1019
01:19:50,416 --> 01:19:53,977
Well, for what it's worth,
you would have, too.

1020
01:19:55,488 --> 01:19:58,480
I have something
much more important in mind.

1021
01:20:24,016 --> 01:20:25,244
Finally.

1022
01:20:32,024 --> 01:20:33,355
Dada.

1023
01:20:35,461 --> 01:20:39,830
<i>Was I wrong about the world?
It's a beautiful new place</i>

1024
01:20:39,966 --> 01:20:42,457
I smell Shrek Junior!

1025
01:20:42,602 --> 01:20:45,264
<i>Where else could a creep like me</i>

1026
01:20:45,404 --> 01:20:48,134
<i>Meet such a pretty face</i>

1027
01:20:48,274 --> 01:20:52,210
<i>Meeting every day with the rising sun</i>

1028
01:20:55,014 --> 01:20:57,915
<i>Looking up, it's looking like</i>

1029
01:20:58,050 --> 01:21:00,712
<i>My losing streak is done</i>

1030
01:21:01,621 --> 01:21:02,918
Peek-a-boo!

1031
01:21:03,055 --> 01:21:04,386
Peek-a-boo!

1032
01:21:07,593 --> 01:21:09,424
A bouncy, bouncy, boy!

1033
01:21:09,562 --> 01:21:12,258
<i>Used to always feel like</i>

1034
01:21:12,398 --> 01:21:15,060
<i>Wished that I was dressed better</i>

1035
01:21:16,068 --> 01:21:17,729
Where's the baby?

1036
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:22,239
<i>Never had a lot of luck
Until I finally met her</i>

1037
01:21:31,751 --> 01:21:35,744
<i>Meeting every day with the rising sun</i>

1038
01:21:38,424 --> 01:21:40,585
<i>Looking up, it's looking like</i>

1039
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:44,093
<i>My losing streak is done</i>

1040
01:21:46,265 --> 01:21:48,597
<i>My losing streak is done</i>

1041
01:21:59,445 --> 01:22:02,107
Well... what shall we do now?

1042
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:19,791
I got it.

1043
01:22:26,305 --> 01:22:30,674
Puss and Donkey, baby!
Once again, come on!

1044
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:35,440
<i>I want to thank you for letting me
be myself</i>

1045
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:36,673
<i>Again!</i>

1046
01:22:36,816 --> 01:22:38,681
Look at my hips!

1047
01:22:38,818 --> 01:22:44,017
<i>I want to thank you for letting me
be myself</i>

1048
01:22:44,156 --> 01:22:45,646
<i>Again!</i>

1049
01:22:50,930 --> 01:22:52,454
- Break it down!
- Let's go!

1050
01:22:52,598 --> 01:22:54,998
<i>Stiff all in the collar</i>

1051
01:22:56,836 --> 01:22:58,997
<i>Fluffy in the face</i>

1052
01:23:01,173 --> 01:23:03,664
<i>Chit chat chatter trying</i>

1053
01:23:05,011 --> 01:23:07,172
<i>Stuffy in the place</i>

1054
01:23:09,348 --> 01:23:12,181
<i>Thank you for the par-tay</i>

1055
01:23:13,352 --> 01:23:15,217
<i>But I could never stay</i>

1056
01:23:15,354 --> 01:23:16,685
I'm sorry.

1057
01:23:17,356 --> 01:23:20,348
<i>I got many things on my mind</i>

1058
01:23:21,694 --> 01:23:23,855
<i>But the word's in the way</i>

1059
01:23:24,864 --> 01:23:30,063
<i>And I want to thank you for letting me
be myself</i>

1060
01:23:30,202 --> 01:23:31,533
<i>Again</i>

1061
01:23:32,538 --> 01:23:34,506
<i>Different strokes for different folks</i>

1062
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:38,235
<i>Thank you for letting me be myself</i>

1063
01:23:38,377 --> 01:23:39,867
<i>Again</i>

1064
01:23:42,048 --> 01:23:43,538
Break it down!

1065
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:47,713
Puss and Donkey, baby!
Puss and Donkey, baby!

1066
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:49,881
Puss and Donkey, baby!

1067
01:23:51,223 --> 01:23:53,384
<i>Dance to the music</i>

1068
01:23:55,227 --> 01:23:57,559
<i>All night long</i>

1069
01:23:59,565 --> 01:24:01,897
<i>Everyday people</i>

1070
01:24:03,569 --> 01:24:05,730
<i>Sing a simple song</i>

1071
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:10,231
<i>Mama's so happy</i>

01:24:12,078 --> 01:24:14,069
<i>Mama start to cry</i>

01:24:16,248 --> 01:24:18,739
<i>Papa's still singing</i>

1074
01:24:19,919 --> 01:24:23,411
<i>You can make it if you try
So try!</i>

1075
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:28,458
<i>Thank you for letting me be myself</i>

Oome on, Donkey. Do something right!

1080
01:24:41,774 --> 01:24:44,174
Put the hoofs together!
Put the hoofs together!

1081
01:24:45,277 --> 01:24:49,475
Stomp your boots, baby! Stomp your
boots, baby! Stomp your boots, baby!

1082
01:24:49,615 --> 01:24:53,483
<i>Thank you for letting me be myself</i>

01:25:12,638 --> 01:25:15,334
<i>Can I, can I thank you!
Can I</i>

1090
01:25:15,474 --> 01:25:17,305
Yes! Yes!
