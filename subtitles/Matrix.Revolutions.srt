1
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:22,606
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,326
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:26,153
Should we try to contact them?

4
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:28,286
Won't matter.
My gut says they're down.

5
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:31,540
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.

6
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:33,168
I was afraid you'd say that.

7
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:36,006
Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

8
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:38,628
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

9
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,501
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- The sooner we find them the better.

10
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:50,845
Thought you could use
something to eat.

11
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:52,564
Thank you.

12
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:55,224
Any change?

13
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:58,150
No.

14
00:01:59,197 --> 00:02:03,029
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

15
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:05,822
At least until he wakes up.

16
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:10,159
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.

17
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:12,492
He'd better have some good answers.

18
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,836
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

19
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:20,087
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

20
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:23,546
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

21
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:29,886
Roland, I'd like to run another search
through the Matrix.

22
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:32,269
- For what?
- For Neo.

23
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:35,691
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

24
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,189
Please, for me.

25
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:50,405
This is what keeps bothering me.

26
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:52,577
What?

27
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:56,457
His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

28
00:02:56,632 --> 00:02:59,550
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

29
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:03,053
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

30
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:18,068
The big <i>bupkes. Nada</i>.
He's not in there.

31
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,445
- Sir, I got the projections.
- How long?

32
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:25,159
Based on point of entry and past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

33
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,951
Jesus H. Christ.

34
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,747
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

35
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,337
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.

36
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:40,340
And make sure we are running
on as few pads as possible.

37
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,716
- Hey! You got a call.
- What?

38
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,259
Operator.

39
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,017
It's Seraph.

40
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,439
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

41
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:08,915
Good morning.

42
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:13,663
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

43
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:17,884
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

44
00:04:18,386 --> 00:04:21,090
Are you lost, Neo?

45
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:28,306
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

46
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:34,393
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

47
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:37,855
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

48
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:41,986
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

49
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:46,696
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

50
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:50,208
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

51
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:54,292
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

52
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:13,518
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

53
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:16,484
One thing I've learned in all my years...

54
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:19,740
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

55
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:22,946
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.

56
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:30,000
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

57
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:33,043
I'm sorry this had to happen.

58
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:36,798
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

59
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,886
...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?

60
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:44,974
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

61
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:46,556
What choice?

62
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:49,856
To help you, to guide Neo.

63
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:54,935
Now, since the real test for any choice is
having to make the same choice again...

64
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:58,945
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

65
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:03,245
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

66
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:06,165
...because here I am, at it again.

67
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:10,201
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.

68
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:15,089
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

69
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:19,590
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

70
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:24,307
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

71
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:27,644
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

72
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:31,266
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

73
00:06:31,443 --> 00:06:34,610
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.

74
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,607
The Merovingian.

75
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:41,362
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

76
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,082
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

77
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:50,041
For years he has protected me.

78
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:52,704
I hope he can do the same for you.

79
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:56,546
Please, follow me.

80
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:03,183
Oracle...

81
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:05,558
I know, Morpheus.

82
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:09,478
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

83
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,277
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

84
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:16,190
I don't.

85
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:19,035
I expect just what I've always expected:

86
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:23,496
For you to make up your own
damn mind. Believe me or don't.

87
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:29,086
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

88
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:32,623
He needs all our help.

89
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,755
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

90
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:37,256
No.

91
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:41,344
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

92
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:45,512
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

93
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,431
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

94
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:51,103
Yes, Papa.

95
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,609
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

96
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,571
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

97
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:08,458
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

98
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:10,623
We are most honored to meet you.

99
00:08:11,173 --> 00:08:13,415
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

100
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:18,054
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

101
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:22,303
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

102
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:24,968
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

103
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:30,058
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

104
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,814
It's okay.

105
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:34,649
I don't have an answer.

106
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:38,358
- I don't even know where "here" is.
- This place is nowhere.

107
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:41,324
It is between your world and our world.

108
00:08:42,832 --> 00:08:45,833
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

109
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:48,203
Why did I know you would say that?

110
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:52,329
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

111
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,380
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

112
00:08:55,553 --> 00:08:59,503
I know if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

113
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:02,933
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

114
00:09:03,103 --> 00:09:04,728
Is that what you're doing here?

115
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:08,847
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

116
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:12,193
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

117
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:13,822
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,240
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.

119
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,199
The answer is simple.

120
00:09:26,086 --> 00:09:28,162
I love my daughter very much.

121
00:09:28,338 --> 00:09:31,873
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

122
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,755
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

123
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:37,598
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

124
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:41,134
If it does not, it is deleted.

125
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,975
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

126
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:49,899
- You do not understand.
- I just have never...

127
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:52,442
Heard a program speak of love.

128
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:57,575
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

129
00:09:57,744 --> 00:10:02,122
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

130
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:07,544
I see that you are in love.

131
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,080
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

132
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:13,588
Anything.

133
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:15,754
Then perhaps the reason
you are here...

134
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,216
...is not so different
than the reason I am here.

135
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:28,808
That's him.

136
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:32,863
- Get away! Get away from me!
- We don't want trouble.

137
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:35,949
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.

138
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:39,701
I can't help you!
No one can help you!

139
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:32,170
Oh, no!

140
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:46,148
Damn it!

141
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:53,193
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.

142
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:55,573
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

143
00:11:56,203 --> 00:11:58,195
You think it has something
to do with me?

144
00:11:58,372 --> 00:11:59,700
I cannot say.

145
00:11:59,873 --> 00:12:02,708
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

146
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:05,747
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

147
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:08,709
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.

148
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:11,374
She promised to watch Sati
after we said goodbye.

149
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:13,545
Goodbye?

150
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:16,391
- You're not staying with her?
- It is not possible.

151
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:20,602
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

152
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,222
- My wife and I must return to our world.
- Why?

153
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:27,442
- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?

154
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:30,814
Karma is a word, like love.

155
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:32,781
A way of saying:

156
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,192
"What I am here to do."

157
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:38,987
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.

158
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:42,700
Grateful for my wonderful wife,
for my beautiful daughter.

159
00:12:42,877 --> 00:12:46,922
They are gifts, and so I do
what I must do to honor them.

160
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:53,254
- Papa, the train!
- Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.

161
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:56,930
Can I carry that for you?

162
00:12:58,143 --> 00:13:00,136
All right.

163
00:13:05,526 --> 00:13:06,854
Hurry it up, I'm late!

164
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:15,202
- Who are you?
- He is a friend.

165
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,783
I know you.

166
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:22,658
- So that's what they wanted.
- I need to get back.

167
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:26,209
I'll pay you whatever you want.

168
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:28,837
One way or another,
I'm getting on this train.

169
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,717
Oh, no, no, no.

170
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:33,804
You'll stay here until
the Merovingian says different.

171
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:35,467
If I know him...

172
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:39,141
...you're gonna be here
for a long, long time.

173
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:43,394
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You don't get it.

174
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:46,140
I built this place.

175
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:50,649
Down here, I make the rules.
Down here, I make the threats.

176
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:59,159
Down here, I'm God.

177
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:05,328
Get on the train
or you'll stay here with him.

178
00:14:21,148 --> 00:14:24,102
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.

179
00:14:24,276 --> 00:14:27,028
No. We know what has to be done.

180
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:44,040
Shit.

181
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,866
You gotta be kidding.

182
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:17,077
Holy shit, it's wingless.

183
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:19,416
I get it.

184
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:22,420
You must be ready to die.

185
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:24,249
I need to speak with him.

186
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:29,085
Only way you're getting through
this door is over my big, dead ass.

187
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,215
So be it.

188
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,862
There are no weapons allowed
in the club.

189
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,457
At the bottom of this elevator,
there is a coat-check girl...

190
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:03,831
...and if we are lucky,
one man for checking weapons.

191
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,172
And if we're unlucky?

192
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:08,169
There will be many men.

193
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:12,723
Can I take your..? Oh, my God.

194
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:36,948
What in the hell?

195
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:41,539
I don't believe this.

196
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:48,799
Hey!

197
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:56,144
The prodigal child returns.

198
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:02,398
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?

199
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:07,318
Tell me, how many bullets
are there in those guns?

200
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:10,659
I don't know, but I don't think
you have enough.

201
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:13,664
- We only want to talk.
- Oh, yes.

202
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:19,206
I'm sure you do. You have fought
through Hel to do so. Yes?

203
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:21,581
I'll tell you what I will do.

204
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:25,707
Put down the guns, and I will promise
you a safe passage out of here.

205
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:28,503
- All three of us?
- Oh, yes, yes.

206
00:19:29,598 --> 00:19:31,390
Of course.

207
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:03,209
Who could have guessed we'd see each
other so soon after our last meeting?

208
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:06,469
The Fates are too kind, eh?

209
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:10,137
And since you, my little Judas,
have brought them here...

210
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:15,136
...I can only surmise the fortuneteller
has found herself another shell?

211
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:18,564
Disappointing, but not unexpected.

212
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:22,233
I do hope, however, she has the good
manners to learn her lesson...

213
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:25,738
...and to remember that there is
no action without consequence.

214
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:30,985
And if you take something from me,
you will pay the price.

215
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:33,951
You know why we are here?

216
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:37,751
Come now, what kind of question
is this? Of course I know.

217
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:39,997
It is my business to know.

218
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:43,423
Some might think this is a strange
coincidence, but I do not.

219
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:50,132
I am curious, though,
as to how it actually happened.

220
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:52,432
- Do you know?
- No.

221
00:20:52,603 --> 00:20:54,346
No?

222
00:20:54,522 --> 00:20:56,680
I did not think so.

223
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:59,775
But it is always best to ask, huh?

224
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:02,020
We want to make a deal.

225
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:07,986
Always straight to business,
huh, Morpheus?

226
00:21:08,161 --> 00:21:12,491
Okay. I have something you want.

227
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,623
To make a deal...

228
00:21:14,793 --> 00:21:20,333
...you must have something
I want, yes?

229
00:21:20,507 --> 00:21:24,801
And it so happens
there is something I want.

230
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,348
Something I have wanted
ever since I first came here.

231
00:21:29,517 --> 00:21:32,304
It is said they cannot be taken...

232
00:21:32,729 --> 00:21:35,054
...they can only be given.

233
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:36,560
What?

234
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:41,560
The eyes of the Oracle.

235
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:48,902
I told you before, there is no escaping
the nature of the universe.

236
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,831
It is that nature
that has again brought you to me.

237
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:55,664
Where some see coincidence,
I see consequence.

238
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:58,125
Where others see chance...

239
00:21:58,297 --> 00:22:01,832
...I see cost.

240
00:22:04,012 --> 00:22:07,297
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle...

241
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:10,762
...and I will give you back your savior.

242
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:15,689
It seems a perfectly fair
and reasonable deal to me.

243
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:17,770
Yes? No?

244
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:21,945
I don't have time for this shit.

245
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:56,442
You wanna make a deal?
How about this?

246
00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:00,689
You give me Neo, or we all die,
right here, right now.

247
00:23:01,656 --> 00:23:04,574
Interesting deal.

248
00:23:06,745 --> 00:23:11,573
You are really ready to die
for this man?

249
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:15,325
- Believe it.
- She'll do it.

250
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:18,715
If she has to,
she'll kill every one of us.

251
00:23:18,882 --> 00:23:20,377
She's in love.

252
00:23:21,302 --> 00:23:26,593
It is remarkable how similar the pattern
of love is to the pattern of insanity.

253
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:28,390
Time's up.

254
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,102
What's it gonna be, Merv?

255
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:38,600
Okay. You got yourself in here...

256
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:41,352
...you can get yourself out.

257
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,368
Are you ready for us?

258
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:33,496
Almost, sir. They got
some pretty ancient hacks here.

259
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,828
- But you found Neo?
- Can't you see him?

260
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:38,923
No, sir. We read something,
but I couldn't tell what.

261
00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:45,008
I can't leave yet.

262
00:24:48,018 --> 00:24:50,344
I have to see her.

263
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,228
Now?

264
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:55,734
It's my last chance.

265
00:24:58,404 --> 00:25:00,730
That's it. That's the secret.

266
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:03,065
- You've got to use your hands.
- Why?

267
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:06,198
Cookies need love like everything does.

268
00:25:07,998 --> 00:25:09,457
Neo!

269
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:14,709
I was hoping to have these done
before you got here. Oh, well.

270
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:18,834
Sati, honey, I think it's time
for a tasting.

271
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:22,005
Take the bowl to Seraph
and find out if they're ready.

272
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:24,256
Okay.

273
00:25:24,932 --> 00:25:27,424
- I'm glad you got out.
- Me too.

274
00:25:31,314 --> 00:25:34,683
So do you recognize me?

275
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:38,063
- A part of you.
- Yeah, that's how it works.

276
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:41,073
Some bits you lose,
some bits you keep.

277
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:45,073
I don't yet recognize my face
in the mirror...

278
00:25:46,664 --> 00:25:48,573
...but I still love candy.

279
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:52,413
No, thank you.

280
00:25:52,587 --> 00:25:55,753
Remember how you were
when you first walked through my door?

281
00:25:55,923 --> 00:26:01,001
Jittery as a June bug.
And now, just look at you.

282
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:04,429
You sure did surprise me, Neo,
and you still do.

283
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,886
You gave me a few surprises too.

284
00:26:08,061 --> 00:26:10,350
I hope I helped.

285
00:26:10,522 --> 00:26:13,938
You helped me to get here,
but my question is, why?

286
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:15,901
Where is this going?

287
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,608
- Where does it end?
- I don't know.

288
00:26:18,906 --> 00:26:22,275
- You don't know or you won't tell me?
- I told you before...

289
00:26:22,785 --> 00:26:27,780
...no one can see beyond a choice they
don't understand, and I mean no one.

290
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:32,284
- What choice?
- It doesn't matter. It's my choice.

291
00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:34,953
I have mine to make,
same as you have yours.

292
00:26:35,257 --> 00:26:38,127
Does that include what things
to tell me and what not to?

293
00:26:38,302 --> 00:26:39,547
Of course not.

294
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,926
Why didn't you tell me
about the Architect?

295
00:26:42,097 --> 00:26:46,309
About Zion and the ones before me?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

296
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:51,137
- Because it wasn't time for you to know.
- Who decided it wasn't time?

297
00:26:51,607 --> 00:26:54,229
You know who.

298
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,157
I did.

299
00:27:03,662 --> 00:27:06,995
Then I think it's time for me to know
a few more things.

300
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:08,909
So do I.

301
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:13,000
Tell me how I separated my mind
from my body without jacking in.

302
00:27:13,172 --> 00:27:15,877
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels
by thinking it.

303
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:20,169
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.

304
00:27:22,306 --> 00:27:25,841
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

305
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,554
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.

306
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,973
- Where?
- The source.

307
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,812
That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready.

308
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:42,946
You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.

309
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,707
The Architect said if I didn't
return to the source...

310
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,702
...Zion would be destroyed tonight.

311
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:54,207
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...

312
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:57,134
...but that man can't see
past any choice.

313
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:01,384
- Why not?
- He doesn't understand them. He can't.

314
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:04,226
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

315
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:08,437
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.

316
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:12,306
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

317
00:28:12,735 --> 00:28:14,858
What's your purpose?

318
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:17,068
To unbalance it.

319
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:19,316
Why? What do you want?

320
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:23,408
I want the same thing you want, Neo.

321
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:26,450
And I'm willing to go
as far as you are to get it.

322
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,455
The end of the war.

323
00:28:30,086 --> 00:28:31,545
Is it going to end?

324
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:34,415
One way or another.

325
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:38,377
Can Zion be saved?

326
00:28:38,762 --> 00:28:43,590
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer
to that question, but...

327
00:28:44,435 --> 00:28:49,311
If there is an answer, there's only
one place you're going to find it.

328
00:28:49,482 --> 00:28:52,187
- Where?
- You know where.

329
00:28:54,153 --> 00:28:57,273
And if you can't find the answer...

330
00:28:57,449 --> 00:29:00,948
...then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

331
00:29:02,621 --> 00:29:05,290
What does that mean?

332
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:12,913
Everything that has a beginning...

333
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,546
...has an end.

334
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:18,636
I see the end coming.

335
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:21,722
I see the darkness spreading.

336
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:23,302
I see death.

337
00:29:24,018 --> 00:29:27,601
And you are all that stands in his way.

338
00:29:27,772 --> 00:29:29,101
Smith.

339
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:34,402
Very soon, he is going to have the power
to destroy this world.

340
00:29:34,571 --> 00:29:37,323
But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.

341
00:29:37,491 --> 00:29:40,527
He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.

342
00:29:40,828 --> 00:29:42,239
What is he?

343
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,322
He is you.

344
00:29:44,498 --> 00:29:46,954
Your opposite, your negative.

345
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:50,709
The result of the equation
trying to balance itself out.

346
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:54,920
- And if I can't stop him?
- One way or another, Neo...

347
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:58,963
...this war is going to end.

348
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:04,015
Tonight, the future of both worlds
will be in your hands...

349
00:30:04,186 --> 00:30:05,929
...or in his.

350
00:30:22,497 --> 00:30:25,070
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

351
00:30:32,215 --> 00:30:34,541
I need time.

352
00:30:39,223 --> 00:30:42,806
- That figures.
- Captain Roland.

353
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:45,302
- What's up, Maggie?
- Bane is. He's conscious.

354
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:47,603
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.

355
00:30:54,739 --> 00:30:57,657
I love that smell.

356
00:30:58,702 --> 00:31:01,738
I sure am going to miss it.

357
00:31:02,414 --> 00:31:05,451
- Oracle.
- I know.

358
00:31:05,626 --> 00:31:06,954
I know.

359
00:31:07,127 --> 00:31:09,832
Sati, honey.

360
00:31:10,923 --> 00:31:13,248
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph.

361
00:31:13,426 --> 00:31:16,213
Can I come back?
I would like to come back.

362
00:31:16,387 --> 00:31:19,756
- I would like that too.
- Then I'll see you tomorrow.

363
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:24,937
I hope so, hon, I hope so.

364
00:31:47,503 --> 00:31:48,962
I'm scared, Seraph.

365
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,499
Come.

366
00:32:35,596 --> 00:32:38,383
He's following us.

367
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:46,346
Well, well, it's been a long time.

368
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:50,895
I remember chasing you
was like chasing a ghost.

369
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,023
I have beaten you before.

370
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:58,988
Yes, true, but as you can see,
things are a little different now.

371
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:02,914
And you must be the last exile.

372
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:07,077
- The Oracle told me about you.
- Really?

373
00:33:07,254 --> 00:33:09,164
What did she say about me?

374
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:11,256
That you were a bad man.

375
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:16,296
Oh, I'm not so bad,
once you get to know me.

376
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:49,498
The great and powerful Oracle,
we meet at last.

377
00:33:52,385 --> 00:33:56,763
I suppose you've been
expecting me, right?

378
00:33:56,932 --> 00:33:59,340
The all-knowing Oracle
is never surprised.

379
00:33:59,518 --> 00:34:02,685
How can she be? She knows everything.

380
00:34:03,397 --> 00:34:07,561
But if that's true, then why is she here
if she knew I was coming?

381
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:09,774
Why wouldn't she leave?

382
00:34:15,284 --> 00:34:17,776
Maybe you knew I would do that,
maybe you didn't.

383
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:21,537
If you did, that means you baked those
cookies and set that plate there...

384
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,416
...deliberately, purposefully...

385
00:34:23,585 --> 00:34:27,630
...which means that you're sitting there
also deliberately, purposefully.

386
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:30,506
What did you do with Sati?

387
00:34:31,218 --> 00:34:35,797
"Cookies need love
like everything does."

388
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:39,303
You are a bastard.

389
00:34:40,102 --> 00:34:42,475
You would know, Mom.

390
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,644
Do what you're here to do.

391
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:51,146
Yes, ma'am.

392
00:35:35,786 --> 00:35:40,365
I really wish I could help, but I just...
I don't remember any of it.

393
00:35:42,043 --> 00:35:45,957
What about the cuts on your arms?
Those cuts are more than one day old.

394
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:49,169
Yeah, definitely.

395
00:35:49,342 --> 00:35:51,631
You're right about that, sir.

396
00:35:52,137 --> 00:35:55,471
They look like they
might be self-inflicted.

397
00:35:55,641 --> 00:35:59,888
But why would I do something
like that to myself?

398
00:36:00,062 --> 00:36:04,890
Unless, of course, I wasn't myself.

399
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:09,729
But if I'm not me, then who am I?

400
00:36:14,494 --> 00:36:18,622
- Has this man been tested for VDTs?
- Yes, sir. It was negative.

401
00:36:19,332 --> 00:36:22,499
But he is showing a lot
of unusual neural activity.

402
00:36:22,669 --> 00:36:26,003
Some cross-synaptic firing,
as well as signs of recent trauma...

403
00:36:26,173 --> 00:36:29,957
...with fresh fibrotic scarring
throughout the cortex.

404
00:36:30,344 --> 00:36:34,971
I want the truth. I don't care
what it takes. Make him remember.

405
00:36:56,455 --> 00:36:57,783
Sir, we found her.

406
00:36:57,956 --> 00:36:59,285
- The <i>Logos</i>?
- Yes, sir.

407
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,534
About time we had
some goddamn good news.

408
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:34,576
Are the thermals picking up
any signs of life?

409
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,240
No, sir. Nothing yet.

410
00:37:37,415 --> 00:37:41,033
- What about the ship?
- Holographic says the hull's still intact.

411
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:44,247
- Drop down and keep a man in the turret.
- Yes, sir.

412
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,514
Get a full diagnostic on that ship
as fast as humanly possible.

413
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:17,618
Careful, sir.

414
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:22,293
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.

415
00:38:47,864 --> 00:38:49,821
What was that?

416
00:38:51,868 --> 00:38:54,988
You can put that shit away, boys.
All she needs is a jump.

417
00:38:56,665 --> 00:38:59,666
- Niobe.
- Morpheus.

418
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:05,998
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

419
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:09,011
We didn't know what happened after...

420
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:13,967
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

421
00:39:14,142 --> 00:39:16,182
I'm happy to see you too.

422
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,929
- Did you get Neo out?
- Yes.

423
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,264
- How did you know about that?
- The Oracle.

424
00:39:21,441 --> 00:39:24,015
- You saw her?
- Just before the sentinels found us.

425
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:28,692
- What did she tell you?
- The same thing she always does.

426
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,696
Exactly what I needed to hear.

427
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,200
In 12 hours, the machines
will breach the dock walls.

428
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:41,871
Every simulation we've run, we've seen
that once the machines are inside...

429
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,716
...the odds of our survival
decrease dramatically.

430
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,876
Thus, our primary objective must be...

431
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:50,503
...to destroy or disable the diggers
inside the dock.

432
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:54,892
If we can do that, perhaps we can
prevent them from reaching the city.

433
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,227
If not, the only place we will be able
to mount a defense...

434
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:00,556
...will be at the entrance of the temple.

435
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:03,485
It is small and will force
them into a bottleneck...

436
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:06,737
...allowing us to concentrate
the remainder of our defense.

437
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:10,109
We understand that you've requested
additional volunteers.

438
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:12,776
- That is correct.
- Precisely what size force...

439
00:40:12,954 --> 00:40:16,204
...are you planning to commit
to the primary dock objective?

440
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:19,909
Right now, the entire APU Corps
and half the infantry.

441
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:23,088
- Half the infantry?
- If it were up to me, councilor...

442
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:26,542
...I'd take every man, woman and child,
put a gun in their hand...

443
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,593
...and march them into that dock.

444
00:40:28,763 --> 00:40:31,514
Perhaps it is best
that it is not up to you.

445
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:33,640
Time will tell, councilor.

446
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:36,604
Commander, just one more question.

447
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:39,060
Has there been word
from the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>?

448
00:40:39,232 --> 00:40:42,683
None, and at this point there's no reason
to expect there will be.

449
00:40:42,861 --> 00:40:44,853
Perhaps.

450
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,441
But we can hope.

451
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:50,027
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.

452
00:41:01,923 --> 00:41:04,877
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.

453
00:41:05,051 --> 00:41:07,720
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

454
00:41:07,887 --> 00:41:10,176
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

455
00:41:10,724 --> 00:41:13,890
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

456
00:41:17,731 --> 00:41:19,973
Kids, you stay here.

457
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:24,310
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

458
00:41:24,488 --> 00:41:26,481
- I have to.
- Why?

459
00:41:26,657 --> 00:41:28,816
Because I love him.

460
00:41:29,493 --> 00:41:31,866
I love him the same as he loves me.

461
00:41:32,038 --> 00:41:35,371
And if I were out there and he
were here, I know what he'd do.

462
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:39,833
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.

463
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:45,166
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...

464
00:41:45,343 --> 00:41:49,211
...and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...

465
00:41:49,389 --> 00:41:51,512
...what would you do?

466
00:41:56,522 --> 00:41:58,562
Make shells.

467
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:12,198
What the shit is going on over here?

468
00:42:12,372 --> 00:42:15,907
An accident, sir. I didn't see...

469
00:42:16,084 --> 00:42:18,207
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?

470
00:42:18,378 --> 00:42:20,667
A unit volunteer, sir.

471
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:25,047
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?

472
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:29,219
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

473
00:42:30,558 --> 00:42:32,681
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.

474
00:42:32,852 --> 00:42:35,972
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.

475
00:42:36,231 --> 00:42:37,559
Okay, I'm 16.

476
00:42:37,732 --> 00:42:41,315
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.

477
00:42:41,486 --> 00:42:46,279
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.

478
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,777
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

479
00:42:49,286 --> 00:42:52,620
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

480
00:42:53,332 --> 00:42:54,707
You do...

481
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:58,535
...and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.

482
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:14,104
Okay, charge the igniter.

483
00:43:20,277 --> 00:43:22,151
She lives again.

484
00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:25,531
You want to reload
the operations software, Sparky?

485
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,116
Yeah. Could you clean the windshield
while you're at it?

486
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:36,532
Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.

487
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:39,463
Looking good, except...

488
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:43,339
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

489
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:46,713
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.

490
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:50,388
<i>- What's going on in there?</i>
- Whatever it is, it can't be good.

491
00:43:51,393 --> 00:43:53,386
The machines have taken Junction 21.

492
00:43:54,313 --> 00:43:57,433
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...

493
00:43:57,608 --> 00:44:00,230
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.

494
00:44:00,778 --> 00:44:04,990
We'll go first, hammer as deep
as we can, then blow our EMP.

495
00:44:05,158 --> 00:44:09,156
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

496
00:44:10,664 --> 00:44:15,492
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

497
00:44:15,669 --> 00:44:17,163
No, it's not.

498
00:44:17,337 --> 00:44:20,422
There's another way. A support line.

499
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:24,340
It drops down right here,
1000 meters short of 21.

500
00:44:24,637 --> 00:44:28,551
If we're lucky, we may be able to
slip down without them ever knowing.

501
00:44:28,724 --> 00:44:30,966
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

502
00:44:31,144 --> 00:44:33,183
- No one can pilot mechanical.
- I can.

503
00:44:33,354 --> 00:44:35,347
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.

504
00:44:35,523 --> 00:44:38,939
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.

505
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:43,737
So what? You'll be the only one that
can. There's no way we can follow you.

506
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:47,826
Hi.

507
00:44:49,455 --> 00:44:54,033
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.

508
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:57,994
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

509
00:44:58,172 --> 00:45:00,295
- I know what I have to do.
- What?

510
00:45:00,466 --> 00:45:03,717
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

511
00:45:03,887 --> 00:45:06,556
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?

512
00:45:06,723 --> 00:45:08,431
To go where?

513
00:45:09,392 --> 00:45:10,768
To the machine city.

514
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,564
I know it's difficult to understand.

515
00:45:17,735 --> 00:45:20,273
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

516
00:45:20,571 --> 00:45:21,899
I still have to go.

517
00:45:22,072 --> 00:45:25,276
In 100 years, no ship has been
within 100 kilometers of it.

518
00:45:25,451 --> 00:45:28,156
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.

519
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:31,330
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
- No.

520
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:34,829
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...

521
00:45:35,003 --> 00:45:37,079
...but do it without
wasting our ships.

522
00:45:37,255 --> 00:45:40,209
- You have to believe me. I have to go.
- Bullshit!

523
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:43,587
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

524
00:45:43,762 --> 00:45:47,594
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.

525
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:55,268
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.

526
00:45:56,275 --> 00:45:59,229
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...

527
00:45:59,404 --> 00:46:01,692
...with my ship
after that little speech.

528
00:46:01,865 --> 00:46:06,278
- But for chrissake, Niobe...
- I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

529
00:46:06,828 --> 00:46:10,447
If we leave inside the hour,
we'll reach Zion as the machines do.

530
00:46:10,624 --> 00:46:13,162
That's as good a plan as any.

531
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:17,084
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

532
00:46:22,636 --> 00:46:25,803
Two ships, two directions.

533
00:46:25,973 --> 00:46:29,140
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

534
00:46:29,811 --> 00:46:32,978
- You've never believed in the One.
- I still don't.

535
00:46:33,148 --> 00:46:34,856
Then why are you doing this?

536
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:38,020
I believe in him.

537
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,903
Thank you.

538
00:46:46,829 --> 00:46:49,830
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.

539
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:52,834
To make it easier for you to remember.

540
00:46:53,502 --> 00:46:55,661
What if I don't want to remember?

541
00:46:56,672 --> 00:46:58,749
Why would you want that?

542
00:46:58,925 --> 00:47:02,009
What if I blew that EMP?

543
00:47:03,096 --> 00:47:05,005
What if I did destroy those ships...

544
00:47:05,181 --> 00:47:09,974
...and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?

545
00:47:12,022 --> 00:47:15,023
If I did that...

546
00:47:15,192 --> 00:47:18,941
...it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

547
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:33,037
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

548
00:47:40,886 --> 00:47:43,044
I'm ready.

549
00:47:44,139 --> 00:47:46,132
Trinity...

550
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:49,729
...there's something I have to say.

551
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:55,602
Something you need to understand.

552
00:47:56,819 --> 00:47:59,690
I know I'm supposed to go.

553
00:47:59,864 --> 00:48:02,106
But beyond that...

554
00:48:03,118 --> 00:48:05,573
...I don't know. I...

555
00:48:05,745 --> 00:48:09,660
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

556
00:48:11,418 --> 00:48:16,294
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.

557
00:48:16,465 --> 00:48:19,135
Just like you knew the moment
you looked at me...

558
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:21,674
...that I was coming with you.

559
00:48:23,806 --> 00:48:25,514
I'm scared, Trin.

560
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,807
So am I.

561
00:48:28,603 --> 00:48:32,268
It took me 10 minutes
to buckle up one boot.

562
00:48:33,275 --> 00:48:35,351
But I'll tell you something.

563
00:48:35,527 --> 00:48:38,445
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...

564
00:48:38,614 --> 00:48:41,615
...I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

565
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:46,741
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

566
00:48:46,914 --> 00:48:48,456
No.

567
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,328
Nothing.

568
00:49:03,682 --> 00:49:06,007
<i>- Finished loading ammunition?</i>
- Just about.

569
00:49:06,184 --> 00:49:08,510
Let's move it. We are out of time.

570
00:49:08,687 --> 00:49:10,976
You're not leaving them anything?

571
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,306
He said he didn't need it.

572
00:49:17,196 --> 00:49:20,648
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.

573
00:49:21,075 --> 00:49:22,902
Thank you.

574
00:49:27,707 --> 00:49:30,661
I can only hope you know
what you're doing.

575
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:32,246
Me too.

576
00:49:36,466 --> 00:49:38,009
It was an honor, sir.

577
00:49:42,222 --> 00:49:44,345
No, the honor is still mine.

578
00:49:58,198 --> 00:50:01,282
<i>- We're ready, sir.</i>
- About damn time.

579
00:50:02,494 --> 00:50:06,077
We're already late, captain,
so let's hit it and hit it hard.

580
00:50:09,793 --> 00:50:11,703
Bye, baby.

581
00:50:11,879 --> 00:50:13,706
Take good care of them.

582
00:50:35,529 --> 00:50:37,320
Ready?

583
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:47,120
Engine's still firing.

584
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:49,913
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.

585
00:51:03,809 --> 00:51:06,216
I should've known he'd
send his bitch first.

586
00:51:06,395 --> 00:51:07,723
Bane.

587
00:51:07,896 --> 00:51:11,016
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

588
00:51:11,191 --> 00:51:13,184
Every time, I thought it was the last.

589
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:17,193
Every time, I was sure we had you,
but you'd slip through our fingers.

590
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:21,943
I really can't express
just how aggravating that can be.

591
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:25,290
What are you talking about?

592
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:30,700
I think I might enjoy killing you
as much as killing him.

593
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:49,814
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!

594
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:53,271
You're gonna pay for that.

595
00:51:54,404 --> 00:51:57,321
- Twenty-seven kilometers to go.
<i>- We got an emergency.</i>

596
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,982
- What is it, AK?
<i>- It's Maggie, sir.</i>

597
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,366
<i>She's dead, murdered.</i>
<i>I think it was Bane.</i>

598
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:05,029
Goddamn it.

599
00:52:06,959 --> 00:52:10,375
I knew it. I knew he was
out of his goddamn mind.

600
00:52:10,546 --> 00:52:12,337
He fired that EMP.

601
00:52:12,506 --> 00:52:16,172
Goddamn it, I should have
beaten it out of him.

602
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:19,261
We searched the whole ship, captain.
He ain't here.

603
00:52:20,932 --> 00:52:23,257
- I know where he is.
- The <i>Logos</i>.

604
00:52:24,894 --> 00:52:26,686
- We gotta go back.
- Too late.

605
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:29,772
- What if they need our help?
- It's too dangerous.

606
00:52:29,941 --> 00:52:31,851
- Why?
- Because if he's killed them...

607
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:33,605
...he'll control another EMP.

608
00:52:35,113 --> 00:52:38,946
At this point, they're on their own.
Just like us.

609
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:42,196
Mr. Anderson.

610
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,030
I see you are as predictable in this world
as you are in the other.

611
00:52:47,502 --> 00:52:49,044
- What?
- He's out of his mind.

612
00:52:49,212 --> 00:52:52,166
It might appear that way.
But Mr. Anderson and I know...

613
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,211
...that appearances can be deceiving.

614
00:52:55,385 --> 00:52:59,217
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It'll all become clear in a moment.

615
00:52:59,389 --> 00:53:02,639
Thank you for bringing me the gun.
You can set it down there.

616
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:04,886
Don't do it.

617
00:53:05,062 --> 00:53:09,274
- Shoot. Shoot now.
- Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive.

618
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:12,727
Do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both.

619
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:17,901
Look at him. He knows
he should do it, but he won't.

620
00:53:18,076 --> 00:53:21,077
- He can't.
- Do it.

621
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:32,086
Back away from the gun
and turn around.

622
00:53:39,098 --> 00:53:40,426
Let her go.

623
00:53:53,613 --> 00:53:56,650
Somehow familiar, isn't it?

624
00:53:56,825 --> 00:54:00,989
We've been here before,
you and I, remember?

625
00:54:01,163 --> 00:54:04,781
I do. I think of nothing else.

626
00:54:09,338 --> 00:54:12,458
- Who are you?
- Still don't recognize me?

627
00:54:13,634 --> 00:54:18,131
I admit, it is difficult to even think
encased in this rotting piece of meat.

628
00:54:18,306 --> 00:54:24,641
The stink of it filling every breath,
a suffocating cloud you can't escape.

629
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,724
Disgusting.

630
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:34,654
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.

631
00:54:39,995 --> 00:54:43,329
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.

632
00:54:46,419 --> 00:54:50,796
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.

633
00:54:50,965 --> 00:54:52,923
Look past the flesh.

634
00:54:53,093 --> 00:54:58,432
Look through the soft gelatin of these
dull cow eyes and see your enemy.

635
00:55:00,517 --> 00:55:03,518
- No.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.

636
00:55:03,896 --> 00:55:06,813
- It can't be.
- There's nowhere I can't go.

637
00:55:06,982 --> 00:55:09,853
There is nowhere I won't find you.

638
00:55:10,027 --> 00:55:14,072
- It's impossible.
- Not impossible.

639
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:16,193
Inevitable.

640
00:55:18,036 --> 00:55:20,028
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

641
00:55:20,205 --> 00:55:21,865
This is it. It's gotta be.

642
00:56:07,254 --> 00:56:08,583
Oh, no.

643
00:56:26,775 --> 00:56:30,643
I wish you could see yourself,
Mr. Anderson.

644
00:56:35,117 --> 00:56:37,359
Blind messiah.

645
00:56:41,624 --> 00:56:44,958
You're a symbol for all of your kind,
Mr. Anderson.

646
00:56:47,797 --> 00:56:49,956
Helpless.

647
00:56:52,302 --> 00:56:54,508
Pathetic.

648
00:56:57,391 --> 00:57:01,720
Just waiting to be put out
of your misery.

649
00:57:07,026 --> 00:57:08,485
I can see you.

650
00:57:17,328 --> 00:57:20,164
It's not over, Mr. Anderson.

651
00:57:20,332 --> 00:57:22,205
It's not over.

652
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:39,056
- Trinity!
- Neo.

653
00:57:40,603 --> 00:57:42,062
Neo.

654
00:57:45,024 --> 00:57:48,191
Oh, no. Your eyes.

655
00:57:48,361 --> 00:57:50,520
I'll be okay.

656
00:57:51,865 --> 00:57:54,023
It's all right, Trin.

657
00:57:55,744 --> 00:57:58,698
But I think you're gonna have to drive.

658
00:58:05,296 --> 00:58:08,416
Seismic's projecting
22 minutes to breach.

659
00:58:08,591 --> 00:58:12,256
They can't know we don't have an EMP.
They'll have to attack in waves.

660
00:58:12,428 --> 00:58:17,091
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.
Order the APUs into position.

661
00:58:17,267 --> 00:58:18,761
Yes, sir.

662
00:58:48,633 --> 00:58:51,338
Come on, move.

663
00:59:23,462 --> 00:59:25,122
All right!

664
00:59:25,297 --> 00:59:27,124
This is it.

665
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:32,376
Now, you all know me,
so I'll just say this as simple as I can.

666
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:36,971
If it's our time to die, it's our time.

667
00:59:37,143 --> 00:59:42,648
All I ask is, if we have
to give these bastards our lives...

668
00:59:42,815 --> 00:59:45,651
...we give them hell before we do!

669
00:59:45,902 --> 00:59:47,811
Yeah!

670
01:00:02,628 --> 01:00:05,499
- You scared, Charra?
- Shit, yeah.

671
01:00:06,507 --> 01:00:08,085
But I'll make you a deal.

672
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:11,796
You keep loading, I keep shooting.

673
01:00:14,015 --> 01:00:15,889
Deal.

674
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,362
- Holy Christ, would you look at that.
- Quiet.

675
01:00:28,822 --> 01:00:31,740
- How far to the opening?
- 1.4 kilometers.

676
01:00:31,909 --> 01:00:36,618
- We're still generating too hot a field.
- Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.

677
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:40,538
- Full manual. Drop down four pads.
- It'll bottom out.

678
01:00:50,554 --> 01:00:53,887
- Easy, baby.
- Seven hundred meters.

679
01:00:56,393 --> 01:00:59,098
If we can just get close enough...

680
01:01:03,609 --> 01:01:04,985
Six hundred meters.

681
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:07,730
There.

682
01:01:15,288 --> 01:01:16,913
Shit!

683
01:01:19,251 --> 01:01:21,658
- Jig's up, here they come.
- Give me full power.

684
01:01:21,837 --> 01:01:24,624
Man the gun turrets,
every goddamn one of them. Go!

685
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:28,464
Ghost, you're the best gunner,
go with them. Morpheus, take his place.

686
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:48,276
I'm coming, baby.

687
01:01:57,124 --> 01:01:59,117
Here they come.

688
01:02:03,422 --> 01:02:07,551
<i>- Slow down, this ain't the</i> Logos.
- Hang on to your lunch, here we go.

689
01:02:16,228 --> 01:02:19,348
Holy Christ, I didn't know
this ship could do that.

690
01:03:11,202 --> 01:03:12,745
Breach! The dock is breached!

691
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,719
Knuckle up!

692
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,652
For Zion!

693
01:05:58,796 --> 01:06:00,540
Shit.

694
01:06:05,345 --> 01:06:07,503
Come on, let's go.

695
01:06:13,228 --> 01:06:14,639
Knuckle up!

696
01:06:29,746 --> 01:06:31,121
Reload!

697
01:06:32,832 --> 01:06:34,741
Reload nine!

698
01:06:41,425 --> 01:06:42,753
Go, go! Move, move!

699
01:06:55,106 --> 01:06:56,766
Watch your left!

700
01:06:57,859 --> 01:07:00,101
Don't let them through!

701
01:07:03,114 --> 01:07:04,656
Zuka!

702
01:07:41,613 --> 01:07:43,405
Oh, my God.

703
01:07:56,921 --> 01:08:00,622
Where the hell's my infantry? I want
that goddamn machine taken down!

704
01:08:34,544 --> 01:08:35,873
Dig this!

705
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:41,378
Oh, shit!

706
01:09:02,157 --> 01:09:04,399
- Bogey two at the breach point!
- Goddamn it!

707
01:09:30,436 --> 01:09:32,595
Shit, she's got a fat ass.

708
01:09:41,907 --> 01:09:45,358
- Keep them off me!
- Christ, there's a shitstorm of them.

709
01:10:17,236 --> 01:10:19,905
- You see that?
- They're after the radio. Stop them!

710
01:10:27,705 --> 01:10:29,034
Damn it!

711
01:10:53,858 --> 01:10:55,317
Yeah.

712
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:08,912
Grab my belt.

713
01:11:19,343 --> 01:11:20,802
Just give me one clean shot.

714
01:11:27,644 --> 01:11:29,387
Damn it!

715
01:11:51,502 --> 01:11:53,127
Charra!

716
01:11:58,093 --> 01:12:00,797
- I got incoming!
- We got a dock full of incoming!

717
01:12:00,971 --> 01:12:03,426
- Yes, sir. But this is different, sir.
- What?

718
01:12:04,099 --> 01:12:05,807
I think it's one of ours, sir.

719
01:12:05,976 --> 01:12:08,930
- That's impossible.
- Holographics are trying to confirm.

720
01:12:09,104 --> 01:12:10,848
Contact them.
I want access codes.

721
01:12:11,023 --> 01:12:13,561
We're trying, sir.
There's no response.

722
01:12:14,902 --> 01:12:17,607
It's a trick. That's not one of ours,
it can't be.

723
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,612
That's a mechanical line.
No one can pilot mechanical.

724
01:12:31,878 --> 01:12:35,129
- Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.
- Thirty degrees, 80.

725
01:12:38,135 --> 01:12:41,171
- Lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent.
- Sixty degrees.

726
01:12:44,058 --> 01:12:47,059
- Shit! Come on, keep up!
- I'm trying!

727
01:13:06,999 --> 01:13:09,704
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the <i>Hammer</i>, sir.

728
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:11,581
How can that be?

729
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:13,746
It's under attack, sustaining damage.

730
01:13:13,923 --> 01:13:16,710
At present velocity,
it'll reach Gate Three in 12 minutes.

731
01:13:16,884 --> 01:13:19,209
Their EMP could take out every sentinel.

732
01:13:20,096 --> 01:13:23,512
It'd take out more than that.
It'll wipe out our defense system.

733
01:13:23,683 --> 01:13:25,925
We blow an EMP inside,
we lose the dock.

734
01:13:26,519 --> 01:13:28,393
Sir, we already lost the dock.

735
01:13:32,567 --> 01:13:33,896
Open the gate.

736
01:13:35,696 --> 01:13:39,943
Gate Three is not responding!
We've taken critical damage, sir!

737
01:13:40,117 --> 01:13:42,359
We've lost control!
We can't open it!

738
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:53,458
There's the exit.

739
01:13:53,631 --> 01:13:57,083
On my mark, give me full power
90 degrees to lower-left starboard.

740
01:13:57,552 --> 01:13:59,344
Full power...

741
01:13:59,596 --> 01:14:00,924
...ninety degrees.

742
01:14:07,229 --> 01:14:08,557
Now!

743
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:18,070
Hold on, baby.

744
01:14:22,745 --> 01:14:24,572
Goddamn, woman, you can drive.

745
01:14:24,748 --> 01:14:26,740
We ain't home yet.
What about the gate?

746
01:14:29,377 --> 01:14:30,872
Sentinels are inside the dock.

747
01:14:32,255 --> 01:14:33,584
Are we too late?

748
01:15:03,121 --> 01:15:05,873
- How many APUs are operational?
- Thirteen, sir.

749
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:08,034
Get me the one closest to Gate Three.

750
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:37,693
Reload!

751
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,195
He's pissing metal.

752
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:44,205
Go!

753
01:15:58,722 --> 01:16:00,050
Go!

754
01:16:21,955 --> 01:16:23,746
Heads up! They're coming around!

755
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,298
Behind you!

756
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,693
It's jammed!

757
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:02,163
Forget it, kid! Get out of here!

758
01:17:03,248 --> 01:17:04,908
Got it!

759
01:17:33,447 --> 01:17:35,274
Captain Mifune.

760
01:17:38,411 --> 01:17:40,320
Oh, no.

761
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:42,158
They're coming.

762
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:46,119
They're coming.

763
01:17:47,378 --> 01:17:48,707
The <i>Hammer</i>.

764
01:17:49,255 --> 01:17:50,631
What?

765
01:17:51,049 --> 01:17:53,836
You have to open that gate.

766
01:17:54,594 --> 01:17:56,302
Cut the counterweights.

767
01:17:58,473 --> 01:17:59,802
You can do it.

768
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:03,347
Hurry. There's no time.

769
01:18:04,521 --> 01:18:06,146
Captain...

770
01:18:06,315 --> 01:18:08,687
...I didn't finish the training program.

771
01:18:12,071 --> 01:18:13,696
Neither did I.

772
01:18:36,013 --> 01:18:38,172
- Lock that down!
- Kill the feeder!

773
01:18:38,599 --> 01:18:41,719
We won't make it.
We gotta blow the EMP now.

774
01:18:41,894 --> 01:18:45,014
Come on, someone, please.

775
01:18:59,746 --> 01:19:01,573
Keep the weight forward.

776
01:19:03,626 --> 01:19:05,369
Light as a feather.

777
01:19:09,757 --> 01:19:13,755
Holographic reports Captain Mifune's
APU is up and moving to Gate Three.

778
01:19:19,768 --> 01:19:21,844
Don't over-squeeze the trigger.

779
01:19:32,573 --> 01:19:34,566
Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three.

780
01:19:34,742 --> 01:19:37,529
- How much time?
- Two minutes to impact.

781
01:19:38,245 --> 01:19:42,030
- Captain Mifune, do you copy?
- I think his radio is down, sir.

782
01:19:42,208 --> 01:19:43,667
Mifune...

783
01:19:43,835 --> 01:19:45,459
...this is Lock.

784
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:48,541
I don't know if you can hear me,
but if you can...

785
01:19:48,715 --> 01:19:51,040
<i>... the</i> Hammer<i>'s two minutes away.</i>

786
01:19:51,593 --> 01:19:55,805
<i>You've got two minutes, captain,</i>
<i>to get that gate open.</i>

787
01:19:57,432 --> 01:19:58,843
Link.

788
01:19:59,351 --> 01:20:01,593
Get to the main deck!
Charge the EMP!

789
01:20:38,226 --> 01:20:39,886
Do it, kid.

790
01:20:43,898 --> 01:20:46,816
Neo. I believe.

791
01:20:55,869 --> 01:20:57,909
- Yes!
- Can we make it?

792
01:20:59,206 --> 01:21:01,329
We ain't come this far.

793
01:21:13,513 --> 01:21:15,755
Almost home, almost home.

794
01:21:35,202 --> 01:21:36,745
Burn it, Link!

795
01:22:00,938 --> 01:22:03,892
- You did it.
- No.

796
01:22:04,233 --> 01:22:05,893
We did it.

797
01:22:06,944 --> 01:22:08,273
You're a hell of a pilot.

798
01:22:10,949 --> 01:22:14,234
Some things in this world never change.

799
01:22:14,536 --> 01:22:15,947
But some things do?

800
01:22:17,497 --> 01:22:19,205
Luckily...

801
01:22:19,416 --> 01:22:21,290
...some things do.

802
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:34,259
Link!

803
01:22:34,974 --> 01:22:36,599
- Zee? Zee!
- Link!

804
01:22:43,608 --> 01:22:46,443
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

805
01:22:47,112 --> 01:22:49,104
I made a promise.

806
01:22:57,915 --> 01:22:59,290
You did wear it.

807
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:04,626
Are you kidding?
I'm never gonna take it off.

808
01:23:14,307 --> 01:23:16,347
Three captains, one ship.

809
01:23:16,518 --> 01:23:20,516
I'll assume the other ships were lost
under equally pointless circumstances.

810
01:23:20,689 --> 01:23:22,314
Good to see you too, Jason.

811
01:23:22,482 --> 01:23:24,808
The Council's waiting to hear
an explanation.

812
01:23:24,985 --> 01:23:29,149
Forgive me for not attending,
but I have to try to salvage this debacle.

813
01:23:29,865 --> 01:23:32,487
Did I miss something?
I thought we saved the dock.

814
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:34,487
That's the problem with you people.

815
01:23:34,662 --> 01:23:37,236
You can't think but five minutes
in front of you.

816
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:41,123
That EMP knocked out almost every
piece of hardware and every APU.

817
01:23:41,294 --> 01:23:44,248
If I were the machines,
I'd send every sentinel here now.

818
01:23:44,547 --> 01:23:48,166
Save the dock, captain?
You handed it to them on a silver platter.

819
01:23:53,891 --> 01:23:55,930
Come on, get it cut.

820
01:23:57,519 --> 01:23:58,848
The bridge is clear.

821
01:24:01,399 --> 01:24:03,356
Do you hear that?

822
01:24:05,695 --> 01:24:07,237
Get that cable run!

823
01:24:07,405 --> 01:24:11,237
- I want the system back online!
- It's the dock. They've got incoming.

824
01:24:12,535 --> 01:24:14,908
Order everyone to fall back.

825
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,785
Seal the shaft. Now.

826
01:24:18,542 --> 01:24:20,202
Move it!

827
01:24:23,589 --> 01:24:25,213
Oh, my God.

828
01:24:33,391 --> 01:24:35,549
- All clear.
- Do it.

829
01:24:35,727 --> 01:24:37,885
- Go! Come on! Run!
- Go!

830
01:24:54,204 --> 01:24:55,782
Your move.

831
01:24:56,916 --> 01:24:58,624
So you gave them your ship?

832
01:24:59,085 --> 01:25:03,248
- That is correct, councilor, I did.
- Knowing what he planned to do with it?

833
01:25:04,924 --> 01:25:06,751
The Oracle said nothing of this?

834
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:12,257
She told me Neo would need my help,
and I would choose to help him or not.

835
01:25:12,641 --> 01:25:17,102
But what hope can a single vessel have
against their entire defense system?

836
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:20,474
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.

837
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:24,943
He wouldn't even take any ammunition.
He was totally out of his goddamn mind.

838
01:25:25,112 --> 01:25:27,947
No, he wasn't.

839
01:25:29,784 --> 01:25:32,453
Neo is doing what he believes
he must do.

840
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:37,080
I don't know if what he's doing is right.
I don't know...

841
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:39,871
...if he'll reach the machine city.

842
01:25:40,045 --> 01:25:43,295
And if he does, I don't know
what he can do to save us.

843
01:25:44,633 --> 01:25:49,342
But I do know that as long as there is
a single breath in his body...

844
01:25:50,806 --> 01:25:52,846
...he will not give up.

845
01:25:54,143 --> 01:25:55,685
And neither can we.

846
01:26:02,109 --> 01:26:03,485
Temperature's dropping.

847
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:08,318
Here we go.

848
01:26:47,866 --> 01:26:49,610
We're over the fields, aren't we?

849
01:26:51,036 --> 01:26:52,365
How do you know that?

850
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,989
I can feel them.

851
01:27:03,758 --> 01:27:05,383
Over there.

852
01:27:06,219 --> 01:27:10,051
There's our path. Can you see it?
Three lines.

853
01:27:10,223 --> 01:27:11,552
Power lines.

854
01:27:12,559 --> 01:27:14,302
Follow them.

855
01:27:31,245 --> 01:27:33,119
What are they doing?

856
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:34,997
I don't know.

857
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,791
Lieutenant?

858
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:54,263
Goddamn it.

859
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:55,932
What do we do now?

860
01:28:00,610 --> 01:28:02,733
It is now a matter of time.

861
01:28:03,488 --> 01:28:05,979
The machines will breach
the walls of this city.

862
01:28:07,325 --> 01:28:11,786
I recommend that the Council join the
non-military personnel inside the temple.

863
01:28:12,456 --> 01:28:13,831
How long do we have?

864
01:28:14,291 --> 01:28:16,996
Two hours. Maybe less.

865
01:28:18,754 --> 01:28:22,966
My men have fortified the entrance with
enough artillery to make our last stand.

866
01:28:24,844 --> 01:28:27,335
Beyond that, there isn't anything more
I can do.

867
01:28:27,847 --> 01:28:31,298
Commander, do you think that
we have any chance of surviving?

868
01:28:33,019 --> 01:28:35,475
If I were you, I wouldn't
ask me that question.

869
01:28:36,648 --> 01:28:37,976
I would ask him.

870
01:28:38,858 --> 01:28:42,524
- Why?
- He's the one who believes in miracles.

871
01:28:49,787 --> 01:28:52,325
There. Those mountains.

872
01:28:53,207 --> 01:28:55,081
That's it.

873
01:28:58,421 --> 01:29:00,330
- Do you see what's out there?
- Yes.

874
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,510
If you tell me we'll make it,
I'll believe you.

875
01:29:03,676 --> 01:29:05,336
We'll make it.

876
01:29:08,348 --> 01:29:10,056
We have to.

877
01:30:23,344 --> 01:30:25,052
Sentinels.

878
01:30:36,441 --> 01:30:37,770
There's too many!

879
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:55,789
Gotcha!

880
01:30:56,504 --> 01:30:58,662
- I need help here!
- I can't beat them.

881
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:01,295
- What do we do?
- Go up, over them.

882
01:31:01,551 --> 01:31:04,552
- What?
- The sky! It's the only way.

883
01:31:06,515 --> 01:31:08,258
Then up we go.

884
01:31:43,512 --> 01:31:45,339
Beautiful.

885
01:32:07,245 --> 01:32:09,867
Pump the igniter. The ship will start.

886
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:19,753
Again. Slowly.

887
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,214
Now!

888
01:32:49,749 --> 01:32:51,243
Trin?

889
01:32:53,294 --> 01:32:55,086
Trinity?

890
01:32:56,172 --> 01:32:57,832
Trinity?

891
01:32:58,967 --> 01:33:01,090
- I'm here.
- Where?

892
01:33:01,261 --> 01:33:02,589
Here.

893
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:14,268
We made it.

894
01:33:15,985 --> 01:33:17,859
You said we would.

895
01:33:20,156 --> 01:33:22,611
It's unbelievable, Trin.

896
01:33:23,618 --> 01:33:25,278
Light everywhere.

897
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:28,455
Like the whole thing was built of light.

898
01:33:29,124 --> 01:33:31,282
I wish you could see what I see.

899
01:33:32,961 --> 01:33:34,954
You've already shown me so much.

900
01:33:37,215 --> 01:33:40,501
What is it, Trinity?
What's wrong?

901
01:33:41,929 --> 01:33:44,420
I can't go with you, Neo.

902
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:47,891
I've gone as far as I can.

903
01:33:48,185 --> 01:33:49,514
What?

904
01:33:52,482 --> 01:33:53,976
Oh, no.

905
01:33:54,817 --> 01:33:56,561
Oh, no. No, no.

906
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,980
It's all right.

907
01:34:00,365 --> 01:34:01,990
It's time.

908
01:34:03,577 --> 01:34:06,032
I've done all that I could do.

909
01:34:07,289 --> 01:34:09,661
Now you have to do the rest.

910
01:34:10,417 --> 01:34:12,493
You have to finish it.

911
01:34:12,836 --> 01:34:14,995
You have to save Zion.

912
01:34:15,506 --> 01:34:17,166
I can't.

913
01:34:17,633 --> 01:34:20,967
- Not without you.
- Yes, you can.

914
01:34:21,512 --> 01:34:23,172
You will.

915
01:34:24,223 --> 01:34:27,343
I believe it. I always have.

916
01:34:29,854 --> 01:34:31,479
Trinity.

917
01:34:33,734 --> 01:34:37,185
Trinity, you can't die.

918
01:34:39,239 --> 01:34:41,315
You can't.

919
01:34:41,617 --> 01:34:43,195
You can't.

920
01:34:43,369 --> 01:34:45,527
Yes, I can.

921
01:34:48,708 --> 01:34:51,115
You brought me back once.

922
01:34:53,338 --> 01:34:55,414
But not this time.

923
01:35:01,304 --> 01:35:03,214
Do you remember...

924
01:35:05,017 --> 01:35:07,934
...on that roof, after you caught me...

925
01:35:09,521 --> 01:35:11,313
...the last thing I said to you?

926
01:35:14,068 --> 01:35:15,562
You said, "I'm sorry."

927
01:35:16,904 --> 01:35:19,027
I wish I hadn't.

928
01:35:22,076 --> 01:35:24,365
That was my last thought.

929
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:29,577
I wished I had one more chance...

930
01:35:30,502 --> 01:35:32,744
...to say what really mattered.

931
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:38,128
To say how much I loved you.

932
01:35:40,554 --> 01:35:43,923
How grateful I was for every moment
I was with you.

933
01:35:46,769 --> 01:35:51,680
But by the time I knew how to say
what I wanted to, it was too late.

934
01:35:57,739 --> 01:36:00,277
But you brought me back.

935
01:36:03,161 --> 01:36:05,450
You gave me my wish.

936
01:36:08,751 --> 01:36:12,795
One more chance to say
what I really wanted to say.

937
01:36:17,468 --> 01:36:19,342
Kiss me.

938
01:36:22,307 --> 01:36:24,098
Once more...

939
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:27,186
...kiss me.

940
01:36:54,299 --> 01:36:58,379
Get that ammunition where it belongs!
You got one chance to get this right.

941
01:36:59,262 --> 01:37:01,089
Get that damn thing mounted!

942
01:37:06,103 --> 01:37:08,641
- Hurry.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

943
01:37:23,538 --> 01:37:24,913
Neo...

944
01:37:25,206 --> 01:37:27,614
...if you're gonna do something,
do it quick.

945
01:39:36,428 --> 01:39:38,505
I only ask to say
what I've come to say.

946
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:42,513
After that, do what you want,
and I won't try and stop you.

947
01:39:46,648 --> 01:39:47,976
Speak.

948
01:39:48,733 --> 01:39:51,687
The program Smith has grown
beyond your control.

949
01:39:51,861 --> 01:39:55,277
He will spread through this city
as he spread through the Matrix.

950
01:39:55,449 --> 01:39:56,777
You cannot stop him.

951
01:39:58,869 --> 01:40:01,194
- But I can.
- We don't need you!

952
01:40:02,206 --> 01:40:04,531
We need nothing!

953
01:40:05,626 --> 01:40:09,540
If that's true, then I've made a mistake,
and you should kill me now.

954
01:40:14,635 --> 01:40:16,509
What do you want?

955
01:40:17,847 --> 01:40:19,176
Peace.

956
01:40:45,001 --> 01:40:46,910
What are they doing?

957
01:40:52,509 --> 01:40:54,502
What are you doing?

958
01:40:57,681 --> 01:40:59,590
Morpheus!

959
01:41:23,959 --> 01:41:25,951
And if you fail?

960
01:41:28,213 --> 01:41:30,206
I won't.

961
01:41:51,655 --> 01:41:53,232
Neo.

962
01:41:53,407 --> 01:41:55,067
He fights for us.

963
01:42:36,786 --> 01:42:39,703
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

964
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:41,995
We missed you.

965
01:42:46,129 --> 01:42:49,047
You like what I've done with the place?

966
01:42:49,633 --> 01:42:51,341
It ends tonight.

967
01:42:52,302 --> 01:42:55,303
I know it does. I've seen it.

968
01:42:55,472 --> 01:42:59,221
That's why the rest of me
is just going to enjoy the show...

969
01:42:59,393 --> 01:43:03,011
...because we already know
that I'm the one that beats you.

970
01:44:55,349 --> 01:44:58,266
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson...

971
01:44:58,435 --> 01:45:00,843
...closing in on you?

972
01:45:01,021 --> 01:45:03,180
Oh, I can.

973
01:45:04,525 --> 01:45:08,653
I really should thank you for it.
After all, it was your life...

974
01:45:08,821 --> 01:45:12,440
...that taught me the purpose of all life.

975
01:45:12,867 --> 01:45:16,367
The purpose of life is to end.

976
01:48:52,266 --> 01:48:54,175
Why, Mr. Anderson?

977
01:48:54,351 --> 01:48:58,184
Why, why, why?

978
01:48:58,356 --> 01:48:59,684
Why do you do it?

979
01:49:00,441 --> 01:49:02,434
Why? Why get up?

980
01:49:02,610 --> 01:49:04,402
Why keep fighting?

981
01:49:05,947 --> 01:49:08,438
Do you believe you're fighting
for something?

982
01:49:08,616 --> 01:49:11,286
For more than your survival?

983
01:49:11,453 --> 01:49:14,739
Can you tell me what it is?
Do you even know?

984
01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:19,953
Is it freedom or truth?

985
01:49:20,129 --> 01:49:22,501
Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?

986
01:49:22,673 --> 01:49:26,042
Illusions, Mr. Anderson.
Vagaries of perception.

987
01:49:26,469 --> 01:49:29,553
Temporary constructs
of a feeble human intellect...

988
01:49:29,722 --> 01:49:32,344
...trying desperately
to justify an existence...

989
01:49:32,517 --> 01:49:34,593
...that is without meaning or purpose!

990
01:49:34,769 --> 01:49:38,185
And all of them as artificial
as the Matrix itself...

991
01:49:38,356 --> 01:49:44,477
...although only a human mind could
invent something as insipid as love.

992
01:49:46,949 --> 01:49:49,107
You must be able to see it,
Mr. Anderson.

993
01:49:49,284 --> 01:49:53,828
You must know it by now. You can't
win. It's pointless to keep fighting.

994
01:49:56,584 --> 01:49:59,834
Why, Mr. Anderson, why?
Why do you persist?

995
01:50:03,091 --> 01:50:05,333
Because I choose to.

996
01:51:10,287 --> 01:51:13,371
This is my world! My world!

997
01:51:38,024 --> 01:51:39,768
Wait.

998
01:51:39,943 --> 01:51:42,102
I've seen this.

999
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,605
This is it. This is the end.

1000
01:51:47,284 --> 01:51:51,199
Yes. You were laying right there,
just like that.

1001
01:51:51,372 --> 01:51:53,697
And I...

1002
01:51:53,874 --> 01:51:59,711
I stand here, right here,
and I'm supposed to say something.

1003
01:51:59,881 --> 01:52:01,541
I say:

1004
01:52:01,716 --> 01:52:05,216
"Everything that has a beginning
has an end, Neo."

1005
01:52:13,979 --> 01:52:17,728
What? What did I just say?

1006
01:52:23,072 --> 01:52:26,904
No, no. This isn't right.
This can't be right.

1007
01:52:34,417 --> 01:52:36,077
Get away from me!

1008
01:52:36,253 --> 01:52:37,663
What are you afraid of?

1009
01:52:38,421 --> 01:52:39,750
It's a trick.

1010
01:52:40,424 --> 01:52:42,666
You were right, Smith.

1011
01:52:43,594 --> 01:52:45,421
You were always right.

1012
01:52:48,766 --> 01:52:50,426
It was inevitable.

1013
01:53:22,218 --> 01:53:23,795
Is it over?

1014
01:53:54,836 --> 01:53:57,208
Oh, no, no, no.

1015
01:53:57,380 --> 01:53:58,922
No, it's not fair.

1016
01:54:53,231 --> 01:54:55,556
It is done.

1017
01:55:27,517 --> 01:55:29,806
It doesn't make sense.

1018
01:55:33,773 --> 01:55:35,434
He did it.

1019
01:55:36,193 --> 01:55:38,435
He saved us.

1020
01:55:38,695 --> 01:55:40,854
He saved us.

1021
01:55:41,448 --> 01:55:44,699
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1022
01:55:44,952 --> 01:55:46,280
He did it! It's over!

1023
01:55:46,454 --> 01:55:48,945
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1024
01:55:49,123 --> 01:55:52,623
- What is it? What happened?
- Sir, he did it, sir. Neo, he did it.

1025
01:55:52,794 --> 01:55:54,288
- Did what?
- He ended the war.

1026
01:55:54,462 --> 01:55:56,371
The machines, they're gone.

1027
01:55:56,548 --> 01:55:59,881
The war is over, sir. The war is over.

1028
01:56:01,469 --> 01:56:04,886
Zion! Zion!

1029
01:56:05,057 --> 01:56:06,800
Zion, it's over!

1030
01:56:07,142 --> 01:56:08,636
It's over!

1031
01:56:08,811 --> 01:56:11,480
The war is over!

1032
01:56:11,647 --> 01:56:14,482
The war is over!

1033
01:56:35,839 --> 01:56:38,757
I have imagined this moment...

1034
01:56:39,259 --> 01:56:41,548
...for so long.

1035
01:56:45,433 --> 01:56:47,224
Is this real?

1036
01:56:56,027 --> 01:56:58,862
Neo, wherever you are...

1037
01:56:59,864 --> 01:57:01,904
...thank you.

1038
01:57:45,746 --> 01:57:47,075
Good morning.

1039
01:58:08,354 --> 01:58:12,268
Well, now. Ain't this a surprise.

1040
01:58:12,691 --> 01:58:14,850
You played a very dangerous game.

1041
01:58:15,027 --> 01:58:17,269
Change always is.

1042
01:58:17,864 --> 01:58:21,197
Just how long do you think
this peace is going to last?

1043
01:58:22,535 --> 01:58:24,777
As long as it can.

1044
01:58:28,041 --> 01:58:30,034
What about the others?

1045
01:58:31,712 --> 01:58:33,122
What others?

1046
01:58:33,297 --> 01:58:34,957
The ones that want out.

1047
01:58:35,716 --> 01:58:37,792
Obviously, they will be freed.

1048
01:58:38,385 --> 01:58:40,045
I have your word?

1049
01:58:40,221 --> 01:58:43,969
What do you think I am? Human?

1050
01:58:57,989 --> 01:58:59,567
Oracle!

1051
01:59:06,415 --> 01:59:08,573
We were afraid we might not find you.

1052
01:59:08,751 --> 01:59:11,420
Everything's okay now.

1053
01:59:11,921 --> 01:59:13,664
Look, look.

1054
01:59:14,256 --> 01:59:16,664
Just look at that.

1055
01:59:17,343 --> 01:59:20,013
Beautiful.

1056
01:59:20,930 --> 01:59:23,338
Did you do that?

1057
01:59:23,683 --> 01:59:25,842
For Neo.

1058
01:59:26,186 --> 01:59:28,178
That's nice.

1059
01:59:28,355 --> 01:59:30,015
I know he'd love it.

1060
01:59:30,691 --> 01:59:32,683
Will we ever see him again?

1061
01:59:33,277 --> 01:59:36,028
I suspect so.

1062
01:59:36,196 --> 01:59:37,904
Someday.

1063
01:59:42,703 --> 01:59:44,495
Did you always know?

1064
01:59:44,664 --> 01:59:47,949
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

1065
01:59:48,459 --> 01:59:51,033
But I believed.

1066
01:59:51,963 --> 01:59:54,371
I believed.
