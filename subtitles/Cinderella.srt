1
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:15,295
Cinderella

2
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:19,493
You're as IoveIy as your name

3
00:00:19,915 --> 00:00:21,541
Cinderella

4
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:26,439
You're a sunset in a frame

5
00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:29,773
Though you're dressed in rags

6
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:33,969
You wear an air of queenly grace

7
00:00:35,187 --> 00:00:37,162
Anyone can see

8
00:00:37,364 --> 00:00:41,905
A throne would be your proper place

9
00:00:43,254 --> 00:00:45,044
Cinderella

10
00:00:46,136 --> 00:00:48,985
If you'll give your heart a chance

11
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:50,928
It will Iead you

12
00:00:52,027 --> 00:00:56,121
To the kingdom of romance

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:03,168
There you'll see your dreams unfold

14
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:06,557
Cinderella

15
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:09,852
Cinderella

16
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:18,783
In the sweetest story ever told

17
00:01:32,783 --> 00:01:35,468
Once upon a time... in a faraway Iand,

18
00:01:35,954 --> 00:01:37,361
there was a tiny kingdom...

19
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,266
peaceful, prosperous,

20
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,509
and rich in romance and tradition.

21
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:49,357
Here, in a stately chateau,

22
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:51,377
there Iived a widowed gentleman...

23
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:53,395
and his IittIe daughter, Cinderella.

24
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:58,169
Although he was a kind and devoted father,

25
00:01:58,557 --> 00:02:01,144
and gave his beloved child
every luxury and comfort,

26
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:03,739
still he felt she needed a mother's care.

27
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:06,078
And so he married again,

28
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,628
choosing for his second wife
a woman of good family...

29
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:12,409
with two daughters just Cinderella's age.

30
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:16,378
By name... Anastasia and Drizella.

31
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:21,544
It was upon the untimely death
of this good man, however,

32
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:24,197
that the stepmother's
true nature was revealed.

33
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:26,979
Cold, cruel, and bitterly jealous...

34
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:29,323
of Cinderella's charm and beauty,

35
00:02:29,452 --> 00:02:31,875
she was grimly determined
to forward the interests...

36
00:02:32,174 --> 00:02:33,898
of her own two awkward daughters.

37
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:38,603
Thus, as time went by,

38
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:40,874
the chateau fell into disrepair,

39
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:42,800
for the family fortunes were squandered...

40
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:45,327
upon the vain and selfish stepsisters,

41
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:48,465
while Cinderella was abused, humiliated,

42
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:51,895
and finally forced to become
a servant in her own house.

43
00:02:53,593 --> 00:02:55,536
And yet, through it all,

44
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,707
Cinderella remained ever gentle and kind,

45
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:02,739
for with each dawn she found
new hope that someday...

46
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,214
her dreams of happiness would come true.

47
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:48,463
Well, serves you right...
spoiling people's best dreams.

48
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:51,315
Yes, I know it's a IoveIy morning, but...

49
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:54,356
it was a IoveIy dream too.

50
00:03:58,874 --> 00:04:00,119
What kind of a dream?

51
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:02,647
Uh-uh. Can't tell.

52
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:07,670
'Cause if you tell a wish,
it won't come true.

53
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:09,750
And after all...

54
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:13,758
A dream is a wish

55
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,144
Your heart makes

56
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,172
When you're fast asleep

57
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:30,275
In dreams, you will Iose
your heartaches

58
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:35,208
Whatever you wish for

59
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:38,250
You keep

60
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,923
Have faith in your dreams

61
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:47,376
And someday

62
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:54,485
Your rainbow will
come smiling through

63
00:04:55,287 --> 00:05:00,210
No matter how your heart is grieving

64
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:05,622
If you keep on believing

65
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:10,043
The dream that you wish

66
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:16,414
Will come true

67
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,010
Oh, that clock! Old killjoy!

68
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:25,183
I hear you. "Come on, get up!" you say.

69
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,904
"Time to start another day."

70
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,983
Even he orders me around.

71
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,737
Well, there's one thing.

72
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,553
They can't order me to stop dreaming.

73
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,373
And perhaps someday...

74
00:05:40,397 --> 00:05:43,661
The dreams that I wish

75
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:50,190
Will come true

76
00:06:04,794 --> 00:06:07,032
Shoo! Shoo! Hurry!

77
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:08,787
Come on, Jaq. Shoo!

78
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:20,986
Ia.Ia...ha.ha...Ia.Ia...

79
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:57,010
No matter how your heart is grieving

80
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:02,126
If you keep on believing

81
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,449
The dream that you wish

82
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:11,155
Will come true

83
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:13,052
Look what I found!

84
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,092
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

85
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,077
One at a time, please!

86
00:07:18,944 --> 00:07:20,538
Now, Jaq, what's all the fuss about?

87
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:22,363
New mouse in the house.

88
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,705
Brand-new. Never saw before.

89
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,779
- Visitor, visitor!
- Oh, a visitor.

90
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,897
Well, she'll need a dress.

91
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:33,471
- No, no, no.
- She's a he. He, he!

92
00:07:33,864 --> 00:07:36,003
Oh, that does make a difference.

93
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,529
- He'll need a jacket, shoes...
- Gotta get out! Gotta get out!

94
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,229
- In a trap-trap!
- Trap-trap!

95
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:42,411
Where? In a trap?

96
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,483
Well, why didn't you say so?

97
00:07:58,036 --> 00:08:00,241
Now, now, now... Calm down, everybody.

98
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:02,354
Oh...

99
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:04,502
The poor IittIe thingÂ’s scared to death.

100
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:07,630
Jaq, maybe you'd better
explain things to him.

101
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,011
Zuk-zuk, Cinderelly. Zuk-zuk.

102
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:10,899
Now, now, now...

103
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,308
Look-a, IittIe guy.

104
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,900
Take it r-easy. Nothin' to worry 'bout.

105
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:16,351
We Iike-a you.

106
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:17,948
Cinderelly like you too. She's nice.

107
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:20,574
Very nice. That's-a better.

108
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,775
Come on, now. Zuk-zuk-zuk!

109
00:08:23,392 --> 00:08:24,954
Za... za... zuk-zuk.

110
00:08:28,003 --> 00:08:28,897
Well, that's better.

111
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,108
Well, let's just slip it on for size.

112
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:38,624
It is a IittIe snug,

113
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:40,386
but it'll have to do.

114
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,727
Now, for a name.

115
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:46,635
I've got one... Octavious!

116
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:49,002
But for short, we'll call you Gus.

117
00:08:49,518 --> 00:08:51,428
Like it, Gus-Gus? Like it? Like it?

118
00:08:51,695 --> 00:08:52,623
Uh... Gus-Gus.

119
00:08:53,455 --> 00:08:54,383
Now I've got to hurry.

120
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,078
See that he keeps out of trouble, Jaq,

121
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:58,703
and don't forget to warn him about the cat.

122
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:01,805
Zuk-zuk. Look-a... uh, uh...
ever seen a cat-cat?

123
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:03,411
Duh... cat-cat?

124
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:05,099
Hup! Cat-cat! R-ucifee, that's-a him.

125
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:08,567
Mean...sneaky... Jump at you!

126
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:11,573
Jump at you! Ha! Big, Big! Big as a house!

127
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:15,219
Zuk-zuk... R-ucifee?

128
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,755
Duh... R-ucifee. Zuk-zuk.

129
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:50,316
Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

130
00:09:52,462 --> 00:09:54,350
Come, kitty. Come on.

131
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:02,130
Lucifer! Come here!

132
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,588
I'm sorry if Your Highness
objects to an early breakfast.

133
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,923
It's certainly not my idea to feed you first.

134
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,473
It's orders. Come on.

135
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:32,001
Duh... R-ucifee. Is that a R-ucifee?

136
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:33,881
Zuk... R-ucifee. That's-a him!

137
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,338
Gus-Gus take-a R-ucifee and...

138
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:40,294
Look-it.

139
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,438
Wait! No, Gus-Gus, no!

140
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,677
Now, Iisten here. R-ucifee not-a funny.

141
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,218
R-ucifee mean.

142
00:10:59,183 --> 00:11:00,111
Bruno...

143
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:03,440
Bruno!

144
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:11,762
Dreaming again.

145
00:11:12,342 --> 00:11:13,837
Chasing Lucifer?

146
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:15,696
Catch him this time?

147
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:17,551
That's bad!

148
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:22,038
Suppose they heard you upstairs?

149
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,669
You know the orders.

150
00:11:24,637 --> 00:11:27,256
So if you donÂ’t want to Iose a nice warm bed,

151
00:11:27,614 --> 00:11:29,142
you'd better get rid of those dreams.

152
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,670
You know how?

153
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:34,905
Just Iearn to Iike cats.

154
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:38,973
No, I mean it.

155
00:11:39,236 --> 00:11:40,764
Lucifer has his good points too.

156
00:11:41,574 --> 00:11:43,036
For one thing, he...

157
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,937
Well...Sometimes he...

158
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:50,118
Hmm...

159
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:53,506
There must be something good about him.

160
00:12:06,322 --> 00:12:07,151
Bruno!

161
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:09,705
Oh, Bruno.

162
00:12:10,452 --> 00:12:12,842
Come on now, outside.

163
00:12:15,991 --> 00:12:17,421
I know it isn't easy,

164
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:20,372
but at Ieast we should
try to get along together.

165
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,907
And that includes you, Your Majesty!

166
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:35,862
Breakfast time! Everybody up!

167
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:37,152
Hurry, hurry!

168
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:39,066
Come on, everybody. Breakfast, breakfast!

169
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:42,339
- Come on, everybody, breakfee!- Breakfast!

170
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:44,289
Breakfast?

171
00:12:44,517 --> 00:12:45,499
Ooh, breakfast!

172
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,726
Oh-oh!

173
00:12:57,003 --> 00:12:59,175
R-ucifee! How we gonna get out?

174
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,278
Hup-hup... carefee!

175
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:07,273
Listen, everybody! Got an idea.

176
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,126
Now, somebody gotta sneak out.

177
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:12,104
Let R-ucifee chase him.

178
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:15,251
Run over to a corner and beat R-ucifee there.

179
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,876
Then we all run out. Zuk?

180
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,093
Zuk-zuk, out!

181
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:20,276
Now we choose the one that do it.

182
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:22,034
Everybody, hup!

183
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:23,760
- Hup!
- Uh, hup.

184
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:25,266
- R-ails up!
- Hup!

185
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:28,600
Now...

186
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:29,660
Hup, hup, hup!

187
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:32,314
Uh, duh... uh, hup!

188
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,592
Oh, there you are.

189
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:18,062
I was wondering.

190
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:21,360
All right, breakfast is served.

191
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:35,027
Uh... take it r-easy. Zuk-zuk.

192
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:39,317
Uh, duh... Iet go! Let go now!

193
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,723
Let... go...

194
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,464
Stop that. Shoo, shoo, shoo.
Go on! Shoo, shoo, shoo!

195
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:49,696
Poor IittIe Gus.

196
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:51,611
Here.

197
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:53,020
Help yourself.

198
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:30,476
Hmm... No Gus-gus.

199
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:34,392
Well, guess he got away.

200
00:17:52,898 --> 00:17:54,109
Cinderella!

201
00:17:56,932 --> 00:18:00,097
I'm coming. Oh, my goodness.

202
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,283
Morning, noon, and night.

203
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:03,938
- Cinderella!
- Coming!

204
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:06,050
Coming!

205
00:18:13,612 --> 00:18:15,107
Cinderella!

206
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,608
I'm coming.

207
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,126
- Cinderella!
- In a minute.

208
00:18:31,286 --> 00:18:32,693
Cinderella!

209
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:46,836
Cinderella!

210
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:25,351
Good morning, Drizella. Sleep well?

211
00:19:25,553 --> 00:19:27,080
As if you cared.

212
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:29,678
Take that ironing and
have it back in an hour.

213
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:31,188
One hour!

214
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:33,101
- You hear?
- Yes, Drizella.

215
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,351
Good morning, Anastasia.

216
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,107
Well, it's about time!
Don't forget the mending.

217
00:19:46,972 --> 00:19:49,177
And don't be all day getting it done, either!

218
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:50,550
Yes, Anastasia.

219
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:54,456
- A-a-ahem.
- Well, come in, child.

220
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:57,467
- Come in.
- Good morning, Stepmother.

221
00:19:57,921 --> 00:19:59,897
Pick up the laundry
and get on with your duties.

222
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:01,112
Yes, Stepmother.

223
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:19,715
Mother! Oh, Mother, Mother!

224
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:21,100
Mother! You did it!

225
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:23,879
You did it on purpose! Mother!

226
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:25,806
Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother!

227
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:27,052
- Now what did you do?
- Oh!

228
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,673
She put it there!

229
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:30,857
A big ugly mouse...

230
00:20:31,155 --> 00:20:32,170
under my teacup!

231
00:20:33,747 --> 00:20:34,926
All right, Lucifer.

232
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:36,780
What did you do with him?

233
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:39,600
Oh, you're not fooling anybody.

234
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:41,175
We'll just see about this.

235
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:43,703
Come on! Let him go.

236
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:48,890
Now the other one. Come on! Oh...

237
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:50,517
poor IittIe Gus.

238
00:20:55,903 --> 00:20:58,238
Oh, Lucifer, won't you ever Iearn?

239
00:20:58,432 --> 00:20:59,294
Cinderella!

240
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:00,766
Yes, Stepmother.

241
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:08,955
- Are you gonna get it!
- Close the door, Cinderella.

242
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,446
Come here.

243
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:32,809
Oh, please, you don't think--

244
00:21:33,202 --> 00:21:34,130
Hold your tongue!

245
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:36,279
Now...

246
00:21:38,804 --> 00:21:41,172
It seems we have time on our hands.

247
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:42,998
- But I was only trying to--
- Silence!

248
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:48,755
Time for vicious practical jokes.

249
00:21:50,363 --> 00:21:52,152
Perhaps we can put it to better use.

250
00:21:53,052 --> 00:21:54,427
Now... Iet me see.

251
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:58,268
ThereÂ’s the large carpet in the main hall.

252
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,126
Clean it!

253
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,001
And the windows, upstairs and down.

254
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:04,703
Wash them!

255
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:06,784
Oh, yes...

256
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,308
and the tapestries, and the draperies.

257
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:11,198
- But I just fin--
- Do them again!

258
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:13,534
And don't forget...

259
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:15,873
the garden... then scrub
the terrace... sweep the halls...

260
00:22:16,104 --> 00:22:17,479
and the stairs... clean the chimneys.

261
00:22:17,992 --> 00:22:18,887
And of course, there's the mending,

262
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,516
and the sewing, and the laundry.

263
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:27,587
Oh, yes, and one more thing.

264
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:31,181
See that Lucifer gets his bath.

265
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:50,000
- But, but, but--
- No "buts" about it!

266
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:53,270
My son has been avoiding
his responsibilities long enough!

267
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:56,662
It's high time he married and settled down.

268
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:58,581
Of course, Your Majesty.

269
00:22:59,293 --> 00:23:02,524
- But we must be patient.
- I am patient!

270
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:08,322
But IÂ’m not getting any younger, you know.

271
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:11,902
I want to see my grandchildren before I go.

272
00:23:12,165 --> 00:23:13,572
I understand, Sire.

273
00:23:13,765 --> 00:23:16,996
No, no, you don't know
what it means to see...

274
00:23:17,223 --> 00:23:19,646
your only child grow farther...

275
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:23,392
farther... and farther away from you.

276
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:28,428
I'm IoneIy in this desolate old palace.

277
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:29,959
I...

278
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:33,833
I want to hear the pitter-patter
of IittIe feet again.

279
00:23:35,568 --> 00:23:36,878
Now, now, Your Majesty.

280
00:23:37,674 --> 00:23:39,719
Perhaps if we just Iet him alone.

281
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:42,576
Let him alone?

282
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:45,685
W-w-with his silly romantic ideas?

283
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,686
But, but, Sire, in matters of love--

284
00:23:49,111 --> 00:23:50,290
Love... Ha!

285
00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:54,258
Just a boy meeting a girl
under the right conditions.

286
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,303
So, we're arranging the conditions.

287
00:23:58,044 --> 00:24:00,559
But, but, Your Majesty,
if the Prince should suspect--

288
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,240
Suspect?

289
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,842
Ha! Look...

290
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,306
the boy's coming home today, isn't he?

291
00:24:05,536 --> 00:24:06,332
Yes, Sire.

292
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:08,568
Well, what could be
more natural than a ball...

293
00:24:08,993 --> 00:24:11,296
- to celebrate his return?
- N-n-nothing, Sire.

294
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:15,006
If all the eligible maidens
in my kingdom just...

295
00:24:16,005 --> 00:24:18,592
happened to be there,

296
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:22,530
why he's bound to show
interest in one of them, isn't he?

297
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:24,772
Isn't he?

298
00:24:24,906 --> 00:24:26,467
Y-y-yes, Sire.

299
00:24:26,794 --> 00:24:28,355
The moment he does...

300
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:33,063
soft Iights, romantic music,

301
00:24:34,094 --> 00:24:35,818
all the trimmings.

302
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:38,509
It can't possibly fail.

303
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:40,744
Can it?

304
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,917
Y-y-yes, Sire. N-n-no, Sire.

305
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:47,343
Very well, Sire. I shall
arrange the ball for--

306
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:48,658
Tonight!

307
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,980
- Tonight? Oh, but, Sire--
- Tonight!

308
00:24:52,631 --> 00:24:55,153
And see that every eligible maid is there!

309
00:24:55,865 --> 00:24:58,200
Understand?

310
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,394
Yes, Your Majesty.

311
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:05,817
The pear-shaped tones.

312
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:10,841
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

313
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,979
Sing sweet nightingale

314
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:17,921
High...

315
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:19,907
Above me

316
00:25:21,318 --> 00:25:24,167
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

317
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:27,528
Sing sweet nightingale

318
00:25:28,138 --> 00:25:31,882
High...

319
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:34,604
Above...

320
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:38,572
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

321
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:41,544
Sing sweet nightingale

322
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:48,557
High...

323
00:25:49,812 --> 00:25:52,629
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

324
00:25:54,071 --> 00:26:00,336
Sing sweet nightingale

325
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:05,106
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

326
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:09,203
Sing...sweet...

327
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:13,305
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

328
00:26:13,953 --> 00:26:17,184
Sing...

329
00:26:18,147 --> 00:26:21,444
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

330
00:26:22,405 --> 00:26:27,229
Oh, sing sweet...

331
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,601
Oh...

332
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,094
Sing...

333
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,108
Oh! Oh, Lucifer!

334
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:41,094
You mean old thing!

335
00:26:43,632 --> 00:26:44,624
I'm just going to have to...

336
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,770
teach you a Iesson.

337
00:26:47,346 --> 00:26:48,808
Open in the name of the King!

338
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:53,266
An urgent message from His Imperial Majesty.

339
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:55,793
- Thank you.
- From the King!

340
00:26:56,374 --> 00:26:57,236
What's it say, Cinderelly?

341
00:26:57,686 --> 00:26:59,346
Duh... uh... uh... What's it say, huh?

342
00:26:59,928 --> 00:27:00,767
I donÂ’t know.

343
00:27:01,593 --> 00:27:03,252
He said itÂ’s urgent.

344
00:27:05,211 --> 00:27:07,122
Maybe I should interrupt the... uh...

345
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,373
music Iesson.

346
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:09,980
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

347
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,986
Sing sweet nightingale

348
00:27:13,663 --> 00:27:18,651
High...

349
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:22,463
You clumsy! You did it on purpose.

350
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:23,643
- Be still, you!
- You're always--

351
00:27:23,844 --> 00:27:25,274
- Girls, girls!- It's her fault, Mother.

352
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:26,274
Above all...

353
00:27:26,565 --> 00:27:28,060
self-control.

354
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,044
Yes!

355
00:27:33,513 --> 00:27:34,672
Cinderella!

356
00:27:34,768 --> 00:27:35,771
I've warned you
never to interrupt while--

357
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:37,483
But this just arrived from the palace.

358
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:38,701
From the palace!

359
00:27:38,797 --> 00:27:40,241
- Give it here!- Let me have it!

360
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,422
- No, it's mine!
- No--

361
00:27:41,518 --> 00:27:42,343
I'll read it.

362
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,268
Well...

363
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:46,022
- There's to be a ball.- A ball!

364
00:27:46,352 --> 00:27:48,240
In honour of His Highness, the Prince!

365
00:27:48,592 --> 00:27:49,389
Oh, the Prince!

366
00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:51,025
And by royal command,

367
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,350
every eligible maiden is to attend.

368
00:27:54,836 --> 00:27:56,724
- Why, that's us!
- And I'm so eligible!

369
00:27:58,966 --> 00:28:00,755
Why, that means I can go too!

370
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:03,991
Ha! Her, dancing with the Prince!

371
00:28:04,697 --> 00:28:06,771
I'd be honoured, Your Highness.

372
00:28:07,162 --> 00:28:09,105
Would you mind holding my broom?

373
00:28:13,054 --> 00:28:14,461
Well, why not?

374
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,264
After all, I'm still a member of the family.

375
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,143
And it says, "By royal command...

376
00:28:21,857 --> 00:28:23,963
every eligible maiden is to attend."

377
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:26,627
Yes... So it does.

378
00:28:28,677 --> 00:28:30,620
Well, I see no reason why you can't go...

379
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:33,764
if you get all your work done.

380
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:35,879
Oh, I will! I promise.

381
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:37,860
And if you can find something...

382
00:28:38,186 --> 00:28:39,047
suitable to wear.

383
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:40,513
I'm sure I can!

384
00:28:41,323 --> 00:28:42,306
Oh, thank you, Stepmother.

385
00:28:43,277 --> 00:28:45,864
Mother! Do you realize what you just said?

386
00:28:46,446 --> 00:28:47,658
Of course.

387
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:50,223
I said, "If..."

388
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:52,972
Oh, "If..."

389
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:04,269
Isn't it IoveIy? It was my mother's.

390
00:29:04,856 --> 00:29:05,838
It's pretty-pretty, but itÂ’s old.

391
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:08,722
Well, maybe it is a little
old-fashioned, but...

392
00:29:09,017 --> 00:29:09,945
oh, I'll fix that.

393
00:29:10,842 --> 00:29:12,119
H-H-How you do that, huh?

394
00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:13,647
Wait a minute.

395
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:14,737
There ought to be...

396
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,729
some good ideas in here.

397
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:17,978
Uh-huh.

398
00:29:18,622 --> 00:29:19,560
This one.

399
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:21,208
- Oh, very nice-nice.
- Like it!

400
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:22,303
- We can do it.- It'll be R-easy.

401
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,602
I'll have to shorten
the sleeves... I'll need a sash...

402
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:26,620
a ruffle... and something for a collar.

403
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:28,285
- And then I'll--
- Cinderella!

404
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:30,145
Oh, now what do they want?

405
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:31,802
- Cinderella!
- Cinderella!

406
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:35,933
Oh, well, guess my dress
will just have to wait.

407
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,754
- Cinderella!
- Cinderella!

408
00:29:39,498 --> 00:29:41,441
All right, all right! I'm coming.

409
00:29:45,068 --> 00:29:46,530
Poor Cinderelly.

410
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,646
Every time she find a minute,

411
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,121
that's the time when they begin it!

412
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:53,933
- Cinderelly, Cinderelly--
- Cinderella!

413
00:29:55,985 --> 00:29:57,360
Cinderelly, Cinderelly

414
00:29:57,747 --> 00:29:58,991
Night and day it's Cinderelly

415
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:00,590
Make the fire, fix the breakfast

416
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:02,411
Wash the dishes, do the mopping

417
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:04,212
And the sweeping and the dusting

418
00:30:04,598 --> 00:30:06,224
They always keep her hoppin'

419
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:07,927
She go around in circles

420
00:30:08,215 --> 00:30:09,623
'TiI she's very, very dizzy

421
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:10,708
Still they holler

422
00:30:10,873 --> 00:30:12,849
Keep-a busy, Cinderelly

423
00:30:13,851 --> 00:30:15,990
Yeah...Keep-a busy.

424
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:20,115
You know what?

425
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:22,487
Cinderelly's not go to the ball.

426
00:30:22,783 --> 00:30:23,614
What?

427
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,015
- Not go?
- What did you say?

428
00:30:26,145 --> 00:30:29,016
You'll see. They fix her.

429
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:32,061
Work, work, work.

430
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,301
She'll never get her dress done.

431
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,180
P-p-poor Cinderelly.

432
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:40,837
Hey! We can do it!

433
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:42,663
We can do it we can do it

00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:46,273
We can make the dress so pretty

436
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:48,133
ThereÂ’s nothing to it, really

437
00:30:48,364 --> 00:30:49,444
We'll tie a sash around it

438
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:51,624
Put a ribbon through it

439
00:30:52,046 --> 00:30:53,191
When dancing at the ball

440
00:30:53,455 --> 00:30:54,863
She'll be more beautiful than all

441
00:30:55,408 --> 00:30:58,159
In the IoveIy dress we'll make for Cinderelly

442
00:30:58,802 --> 00:31:00,297

I'll cut it with the scissors

447
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:09,133
And I can do the sewing

448
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:10,806
Leave the sewing to the women

449
00:31:11,512 --> 00:31:12,789
You go get some trimmin'

450

454
00:31:24,254 --> 00:31:26,230
Ho-ho-ho. Cinderelly needs help.

455
00:31:26,975 --> 00:31:28,798
Surprise, surprise! Pretty
surprise for Cinderelly!

456
00:31:37,381 --> 00:31:39,772
- And this too, Cinderella,
my slippers. Now don't forget-

457
00:31:39,974 --> 00:31:41,950
- Cinderella, take my dress!
- Here, mend the buttonholes.

458
00:31:42,376 --> 00:31:44,199
Press my skirt too, and mind
the ruffle. You're always--

459
00:31:44,553 --> 00:31:45,983
- And, Cinderella...
- Yes?

460
00:31:46,218 --> 00:31:49,416
When you're through, and before
you begin your regular chores,

461
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:51,434
I have a few IittIe things.

462
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:54,222
- Very well.
- Mother I don't see why...

463
00:31:54,318 --> 00:31:56,271
everybody else seems to have
such nice things to wear...

464
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:58,026
and I always end up in these old rags.

465
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,374
This sash!

466
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:01,259
Why, I wouldnÂ’t be seen dead in it!

467
00:32:01,682 --> 00:32:05,000
You should talk! These beads!
I'm sick of looking at them!

468
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:08,817
- Trash! Oh, I hate--
- I don't see why I can't have-

469
00:32:10,902 --> 00:32:11,829
Come on! Now, be carefee.

470

Duh... uh... yes-yes-yes, real carefee.

00:32:25,213 --> 00:32:27,221
Oh-ho-ho! We can use that, Gus-Gus!

00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:29,021
Uh... pretty-pretty

473
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,428
Shhh! Look-it!

00:32:30,913 --> 00:32:31,742
R-ucifee!

475
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,703
Uh... duh... duh... Iook.

476
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:18,550
Oh, beads! Oh-ho-ho-ho!

477
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:19,759
Very pretty beads! Oh-ho-ho!

478
00:33:20,025 --> 00:33:20,789
Shhh!

479
00:35:20,374 --> 00:35:22,742
A dream is a wish your heart makes

480
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:26,265
When you're fast asleep

481
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,139
In dreams you will Iose your heartaches

482
00:35:31,132 --> 00:35:33,621
Whatever you wish for you keep

483
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:39,832
Have faith in your dreams and someday

484
00:35:43,394 --> 00:35:45,916
No matter how your heart is grieving

485
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,901
If you keep on believing

486
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:50,877
The dream that you wish will come true

487
00:36:03,468 --> 00:36:07,846
Okay. 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8.

488
00:36:09,744 --> 00:36:12,167
Whatever you wish for you keep.

489
00:36:14,514 --> 00:36:15,734
All right.

490
00:36:17,972 --> 00:36:19,216
Heave-ho, heave-ho!

491
00:36:19,701 --> 00:36:21,010
Heave-ho.

492
00:36:23,735 --> 00:36:24,662
Mmmm mm mm believing

493
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:26,774
The dream that you wish will come...

494
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:30,586
Will come true...

495
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:28,723
Yes?

496
00:37:29,176 --> 00:37:30,704
- The carriage is here.
- Oh.

497
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:34,585
Why, Cinderella, you're not ready, child.

498
00:37:35,227 --> 00:37:36,155
I'm not going.

499
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:39,388
Not going? Oh, what a shame.

500
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:41,686
But of course, there will be...

501
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:44,286
- other times, and--
- Yes. Good night.

502
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:58,308
Oh, well. What's a royal ball?

503
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,120
After all, I suppose it would be...

504
00:38:02,344 --> 00:38:04,320
frightfully dull... and... and boring...

505
00:38:04,906 --> 00:38:06,216
and... and completely...

506
00:38:07,948 --> 00:38:09,378
completely wonderful.

507
00:38:15,856 --> 00:38:17,995
Oh, why... itÂ’s my...

508
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:19,645
Surprise!

509
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:20,714
Surprise! Surprise!

510
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:23,503
- Surprise!
- Duh... duh... Happy birthday!

511
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:26,092
- No, no, no, no!
- Why, I never dreamed...

512
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:28,464
It's such a surprise!

513
00:38:29,527 --> 00:38:30,389
Oh!

514
00:38:31,096 --> 00:38:32,820
How can I ever...why...

515
00:38:33,913 --> 00:38:35,856
Oh, thank you so much!

516
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,176
Now remember, when you're
presented to His Highness,

517
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,832
- be sure--
- Wait!

518
00:38:48,096 --> 00:38:48,990
Please... wait for me!

519
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:51,454
Isn't it IoveIy?

520
00:38:52,258 --> 00:38:53,791
Do you Iike it?

521
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:55,443
Do you think it will do?

522
00:38:57,061 --> 00:38:59,069
- Cinderella!
- Mother, she can't!

523
00:38:59,526 --> 00:39:00,486
- You wouldn't--
- Oh, no! You...

524
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:01,924
- can't Iet her!
- Girls, please!

525
00:39:04,265 --> 00:39:05,858
After all, we did make a bargain.

526
00:39:06,857 --> 00:39:07,806
Didn't we, Cinderella?

527
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:12,901
And I never go back on my word.

528
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:16,046
How very clever,

529
00:39:17,327 --> 00:39:18,221
these beads.

530
00:39:19,216 --> 00:39:21,192
They give it just the right touch.

531
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:24,170
Don't you think so, Drizella?

532
00:39:24,627 --> 00:39:25,740
No, I don't! I think she's--

533
00:39:26,996 --> 00:39:29,037
Why you IittIe thief!

534
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,989
TheyÂ’re my beads! Give them here!

535
00:39:32,407 --> 00:39:33,105
Oh, no!

536
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:36,499
Oh... and Iook, that's my sash!
Wearing my sash! She can't!

537
00:39:37,017 --> 00:39:38,709
Oh, don't! Please, stop!

538
00:39:39,258 --> 00:39:41,528
- My ribbon!
- Why, you thief!

539
00:39:42,043 --> 00:39:44,117
- Kitchen wench!
- You ungrateful IittIe--

540
00:39:44,412 --> 00:39:45,657
Girls, girls.

541
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:47,834
That's quite enough.

542
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,885
Hurry along now, both of you.

543
00:39:50,656 --> 00:39:52,250
I wonÂ’t have you upsetting yourselves.

544
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:58,302
Good night.

545
00:40:36,472 --> 00:40:40,402
In dreams you will Iose your heartaches

546
00:40:41,946 --> 00:40:45,111
Whatever you wish for you keep

547
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:47,988
Oh, no. No, it isn't true.

548
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:52,534
Have faith in your dreams and someday

549
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:54,526
It's just no use.

550
00:40:55,009 --> 00:40:57,082
Your rainbow will come smiling through

551
00:40:57,378 --> 00:40:58,807
No use at all.

552
00:41:00,163 --> 00:41:03,394
No matter how your heart is grieving

553
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:06,974
If you keep on believing

554
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:11,390
- I can't believe, not anymore.
- The dreams that you wish...

555
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,745
ThereÂ’s nothing left to believe in.

556
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:17,512
Nothing.

557
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:19,396
Nothing, my dear?

558
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:22,437
Oh, now you don't really mean that.

559
00:41:22,703 --> 00:41:24,744
- Oh, but I do!- Nonsense, child!

560
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:28,106
If you'd Iost all your faith,
I couldnÂ’t be here,

561
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:29,712
and here I am!

562
00:41:30,451 --> 00:41:32,623
Oh, come now. Dry those tears.

563
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:35,761
You can't go to the ball looking like that.

564
00:41:36,022 --> 00:41:38,609
The ball? Oh, but I'm not--
- Of course you are.

565
00:41:39,511 --> 00:41:40,439
But we'll have to hurry,

566
00:41:41,016 --> 00:41:42,773
because even miracles take a little time.

567
00:41:43,193 --> 00:41:45,333
- Miracles?
- Uh-hmm. Watch.

568
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:48,698
What in the world did I do
with that magic wand?

569
00:41:49,244 --> 00:41:50,813
- I was sure I--
- Magic wand?

570
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:53,433
That's strange... I... I always--

571
00:41:53,503 --> 00:41:55,103
Why then, you must be--

572
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,791
Your Fairy Godmother? Of course.

573
00:41:58,401 --> 00:42:00,093
Where is that wand? I--

574
00:42:01,026 --> 00:42:02,718
Oh! I forgot.

575
00:42:03,364 --> 00:42:04,725
I put it away.

576
00:42:07,045 --> 00:42:09,632
- Look-a what she did!
- Duh... duh... How'd she do it

577
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:11,904
Now... let's see. Hmm...

578
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,937
I'd say the first thing
you need is, um... a pumpkin.

579
00:42:17,226 --> 00:42:19,529
- But... a pumpkin?
- Uh-huh. Now, um...

580
00:42:19,948 --> 00:42:21,356
Now... the magic words.

581
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:23,116
Uh... Oh...

582
00:42:24,238 --> 00:42:25,266
Ahem!

583
00:42:26,863 --> 00:42:28,719
Salaga doola menchicka boola

584
00:42:29,137 --> 00:42:30,664
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

585
00:42:31,537 --> 00:42:33,065
Put them together and what have you got

586
00:42:33,523 --> 00:42:34,930
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

587
00:42:35,892 --> 00:42:37,354
Salaga doola menchicka boola

588
00:42:37,877 --> 00:42:39,438
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

589
00:42:40,086 --> 00:42:41,647
It'll do magic believe it or not

590
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:43,827
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

591
00:42:44,248 --> 00:42:45,231
Now salaga doola means

592
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:48,309
Menchicka boola roo

593
00:42:48,634 --> 00:42:50,740
But the thing-a-ma-bob that does the job

594
00:42:51,132 --> 00:42:52,856
Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

595
00:42:53,468 --> 00:42:55,193
Oh, salaga doola menchicka boola

596
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:57,237
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

597
00:42:57,983 --> 00:42:59,675
Put them together and what have you got

598
00:43:00,096 --> 00:43:00,892
Bibbidi-bobbidi

599
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,386
Bibbidi-bobbidi Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

600
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:06,882
- Oh, Iooky, Iooky.
- Isn't it wonderfee?

601
00:43:07,044 --> 00:43:08,026
Isn't it, huh?

602
00:43:08,517 --> 00:43:10,656
Oh, it's beautiful!

603
00:43:11,302 --> 00:43:13,190
Yes, isn't it?

604
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:16,165
Now, with an elegant
coach like that, of course,

605
00:43:16,457 --> 00:43:19,687
we'll simply have to have... uh...mice!

606
00:43:19,914 --> 00:43:21,441
Uh... uh... mice?

607
00:43:21,963 --> 00:43:23,491
Oh, this really is nice.

608
00:43:24,557 --> 00:43:26,565
Why, we'll have a coach-and-fou
when we're through.

609
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,678
Just a wave of my stick,
and to finish the trick,

610
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,656
Bibbidi.. bobbidi...

611
00:43:32,016 --> 00:43:33,195
boo!

612
00:43:33,393 --> 00:43:34,441
Gracious, what did I do?

613
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,946
I was sure there were four there.

614
00:43:37,235 --> 00:43:38,610
There should be one more.

615
00:43:39,412 --> 00:43:41,039
Oh, ha-ha. There you are.

616
00:43:42,517 --> 00:43:43,860
Bibbidi... bobbidi...

617
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:44,817
boo!

618
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:55,580
- Shoo!- Oh, poor Lucifer.

619
00:43:56,797 --> 00:43:57,845
Serves him right, I'd say.

620
00:43:58,206 --> 00:43:59,417
Now... um... where were we?

621
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:00,767
Oh, goodness, yes.

622
00:44:01,952 --> 00:44:03,709
You can't go to the ball without... um...

623
00:44:04,385 --> 00:44:05,116
a horse!

624
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:07,231
A-a-another one?

625
00:44:08,034 --> 00:44:10,785
But tonight, for a change,
you'll handle the reins...

626
00:44:11,396 --> 00:44:13,220
and sit in the driver's seat too.

627
00:44:14,182 --> 00:44:16,933
For instead of a horse,
why the coachman, of course.

628
00:44:17,543 --> 00:44:19,519
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

629
00:44:22,762 --> 00:44:24,356
Well, that does it, I guess.

630
00:44:24,715 --> 00:44:27,782
Except for-- oh, yes,
the finishing touch...

631
00:44:28,141 --> 00:44:31,405
and that's you. Yes, Bruno, that's right!

632
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:32,999
You'll be footman tonight.

633
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,782
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

634
00:44:37,713 --> 00:44:39,689
Well, well, hop in, my dear.
We can't waste time.

635
00:44:39,955 --> 00:44:41,035
- But... uh--
- Now, now, now...

636
00:44:41,203 --> 00:44:42,448
don't try to thank me.

637
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:45,717
Oh, I wasn't-- I mean... I do, but...

638
00:44:45,845 --> 00:44:49,459
- but don't you think my dress-
- Yes, it's lovely, dear.

639
00:44:49,976 --> 00:44:54,037
Lov-- Good heavens, child!
You can't go in that.

640
00:44:56,187 --> 00:44:57,595
Now, uh.. letÂ’s see, dear.

641
00:44:58,525 --> 00:45:01,461
Your size... and the shade
of your eyes... Uh-hmm.

642
00:45:02,686 --> 00:45:04,891
Something simple, but daring too.

643
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:07,420
Oh, just Ieave it to me!

644
00:45:07,585 --> 00:45:08,763
What a gown this will be.

645
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,873
Bibbidi-bobbidi bibbidi-bobbidi...

646
00:45:12,132 --> 00:45:15,930
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

647
00:45:16,326 --> 00:45:18,399
Oh, it's a beautiful dress!

648
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:21,568
Did you ever see such a beautiful dress?

649
00:45:22,793 --> 00:45:24,736
And Iook, glass slippers.

650
00:45:26,794 --> 00:45:28,289
Why, it's Iike a dream,

651
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,210
a wonderful dream come true.

652
00:45:32,013 --> 00:45:34,436
Yes, my child, but like all dreams,

653
00:45:35,247 --> 00:45:37,320
well, I'm afraid this can't last forever.

654
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:40,017
You'll have only
'tiI midnight and then--

655
00:45:40,145 --> 00:45:42,830
- Midnight? Oh, thank you.
- Oh, now, now just a minute.

656
00:45:43,155 --> 00:45:44,563
You must understand, my dear.

657
00:45:45,236 --> 00:45:47,659
On the stroke of twelve,
the spell will be broken,

658
00:45:48,181 --> 00:45:50,070
and everything will be as it was before.

659
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:51,633
Oh, I understand, but...

660
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,994
it's more than I ever hoped for.

661
00:45:55,673 --> 00:45:56,688
Bless you, my child.

662
00:45:57,306 --> 00:46:00,439
I-- Goodness me! It's getting Iate!

663
00:46:00,892 --> 00:46:02,715
Hurry up, dear. The ball can't wait.

664
00:46:03,165 --> 00:46:05,435
Have a good time, dance, be gay!

665
00:46:05,566 --> 00:46:07,192
Now, off you go. You're on your way.

666
00:46:07,391 --> 00:46:09,148
With a bibbidi-bobbidi, bibbidi-bobbidi...

667
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,008
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

668
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:41,095
The Princess Fredrica
Eugenie de Ia Fontaine.

669
00:46:45,906 --> 00:46:48,079
M'amselle Augustina Dubois,

670
00:46:48,981 --> 00:46:51,764
the daughter of General Pierre Dubois.

671
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,053
Ah... the boy isn't cooperating.

672
00:47:05,565 --> 00:47:08,829
M'amselle Leanora Mercedes de la Torre,

673
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:13,365
daughter of Colonel and Madam de la Torre.

674
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:22,108
I can't understand it!

675
00:47:22,694 --> 00:47:25,150
There must be at Ieast one
who'd make a suitable mother.

676
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:26,880
Shhh! Sire!

677
00:47:27,657 --> 00:47:29,218
Uh... a suitable wife.

678
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:52,623
The Mademoiselles Drizella
and Anastasia Tremain,

679
00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:56,117
daughters of Lady Tremain.

680
00:48:01,241 --> 00:48:02,802
I give up!

681
00:48:03,643 --> 00:48:05,498
Even I couldnÂ’t expect the boy to--

682
00:48:05,724 --> 00:48:07,251
Well, if I may say so, Your Majesty.

683
00:48:07,516 --> 00:48:12,604
I did try to warn you, but you,
Sire, are incurably romantic.

684
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:17,404
No doubt you saw the whole
pretty picture in detail.

685
00:48:18,402 --> 00:48:19,351
The young Prince...

686
00:48:20,195 --> 00:48:21,624
bowing to the assembly.

687
00:48:22,628 --> 00:48:23,556
Suddenly, he stops.

688
00:48:24,261 --> 00:48:25,887
He Iooks up, for Io,

689
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:30,661
there she stands, the girl of his dreams.

690
00:48:32,905 --> 00:48:34,946
Who she is, or whence she came...

691
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:37,093
he knows not, nor does he care.

692
00:48:37,964 --> 00:48:39,590
But his heart tells him that here...

693
00:48:40,685 --> 00:48:44,713
here is the maid predestined to be his bride.

694
00:48:46,832 --> 00:48:49,222
A pretty plot for fairytales, Sire,

695
00:48:49,938 --> 00:48:52,558
but in real Life... oh, no... no.

696
00:48:53,524 --> 00:48:54,899
It was foredoomed to failure.

697
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,363
Failure, eh?

698
00:48:57,974 --> 00:49:00,626
Take a Iook at that, you pompous windbag!

699
00:49:02,808 --> 00:49:04,085
Who is she? You know her?

700
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:05,861
No, Sire.

701
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,385
I've never seen her before.

702
00:49:08,252 --> 00:49:09,496
That's one thing in her favour.

703
00:49:10,012 --> 00:49:11,606
The waltz. Quick, the waltz!

704
00:49:15,135 --> 00:49:16,248
Soft Iights.

705
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:17,917
The Iights!

706
00:49:37,162 --> 00:49:38,854
Aha! Failure, eh!

707
00:49:42,925 --> 00:49:46,243
Well...now for a good night's sleep.

708
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,808
Quite so, Sire. I believe I too--

709
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,568
You will stay right here.

710
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,712
See they're not disturbed.

711
00:49:53,234 --> 00:49:54,642
And when the boy proposes...

712
00:49:55,091 --> 00:49:57,231
notify me immediately!

713
00:49:58,517 --> 00:50:00,176
- Notify me immed--
- And remember...

714
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:03,153
if anything goes wrong...

715
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:14,935
Ia...ha...

716
00:50:19,647 --> 00:50:21,558
- But who is she, Mother?
- Do we know her?

717
00:50:22,016 --> 00:50:23,424
certainly seems to.

718
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:25,920
But I know I've never seen her.

719
00:50:26,403 --> 00:50:27,844
Nor I.

720
00:50:27,972 --> 00:50:29,380
But she certainly is-- Wait...

721
00:50:31,525 --> 00:50:33,468
there is something familiar about her.

722
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,091
Ahem.

723
00:50:54,577 --> 00:50:55,657
So this is love

724
00:50:58,643 --> 00:51:00,619
So this is love

725
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:06,039
So this is what makes life

726
00:51:06,904 --> 00:51:09,720
Worthwhile

727
00:51:09,945 --> 00:51:11,156
I'm all aglow

728
00:51:13,211 --> 00:51:14,870
And now I know

729
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:16,723
And now I know

730
00:51:17,565 --> 00:51:24,214
The key to our heaven is mine

731
00:51:25,409 --> 00:51:26,619
My heart has wings

732
00:51:29,283 --> 00:51:31,291
And I can fly

733
00:51:32,837 --> 00:51:36,101
I'll touch every star

734
00:51:37,063 --> 00:51:39,006
In the sky

735
00:51:41,257 --> 00:51:44,871
So this is the miracle

736
00:51:45,868 --> 00:51:51,784
That I've been dreaming of

737
00:52:00,115 --> 00:52:10,093
So this is love

738
00:52:11,512 --> 00:52:12,920
Oh! Oh, my goodness!

739
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:14,739
What's the matter?

740
00:52:14,835 --> 00:52:15,765
It's midnight.

741
00:52:16,411 --> 00:52:19,031
- Yes, so it is, but--
- Goodbye.

742
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:20,756
No, no, wait. You can't go now. It's only--

743
00:52:22,174 --> 00:52:24,063
Oh, I must, please. Please, I must.

744
00:52:24,415 --> 00:52:25,560
- But why?
- Well, I...I...

745
00:52:26,272 --> 00:52:28,477
Oh, the Prince. I haven't met the Prince.

746
00:52:28,865 --> 00:52:30,873
The Prince? But didn't you know--

747
00:52:31,459 --> 00:52:35,039
- Goodbye!
- No, wait. Come back.

748
00:52:35,717 --> 00:52:36,448
Please come back!

749
00:52:37,286 --> 00:52:39,174
I don't even know your name.
How will I find you?

750
00:52:39,622 --> 00:52:40,638
Wait! Please wait!

751
00:52:42,056 --> 00:52:42,852
Goodbye.

752
00:52:44,585 --> 00:52:45,674
I say, young Iady!

753
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,237
- Who is she?
- Wait!

754
00:52:47,595 --> 00:52:49,003
- Who is she?
- Isn't she IoveIy?

755
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:54,535
Mademoiselle!

756
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,581
See rita!

757
00:52:58,673 --> 00:53:00,430
Just a moment!

758
00:53:00,657 --> 00:53:02,251
Stop! Stop!

759
00:53:04,467 --> 00:53:07,436
Stop that coach! Close those gates!

760
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,791
Follow that coach!

761
00:53:12,664 --> 00:53:13,941
Open the gates!

762
00:53:50,379 --> 00:53:51,110
I'm sorry.

763
00:53:52,236 --> 00:53:54,757
I... I guess I forgot about everything,

764
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,357
even the time, but...

765
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,223
but it was so wonderful.

766
00:54:02,929 --> 00:54:04,140
And he was so handsome,

767
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:05,771
and when we danced--

768
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,946
Oh, IÂ’m sure that even the Prince himself...

769
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:11,156
couldn't have been more... more--

770
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:15,159
Oh, well. It's over and--

771
00:54:15,383 --> 00:54:16,332
Cinderelly! Look, look!

772
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,482
- A slipper, a slipper!
- Yeah, a slipper.

773
00:54:18,937 --> 00:54:20,400
- Your slipper, Cinderelly.
- Yeah, your slipper.

774
00:54:21,146 --> 00:54:21,973
Oh!

775
00:54:24,988 --> 00:54:25,916
Thank you.

776
00:54:26,941 --> 00:54:29,659
Thank you so much, for everything.

777
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:43,644
Your Majesty, I see no point
in beating about the bush.

778
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:45,788
I regret to inform you, Sire,

779
00:54:46,343 --> 00:54:47,905
that the young Iady has disappeared...

780
00:54:48,521 --> 00:54:50,245
Ieaving behind only this glass slipper.

781
00:54:51,338 --> 00:54:52,745
Yes, I'll do it.

782
00:54:55,307 --> 00:54:57,764
No, I just can't.

783
00:55:24,347 --> 00:55:26,803
Well? Come in.

784
00:55:27,836 --> 00:55:28,995
Come in!

785
00:55:29,437 --> 00:55:32,122
- Your Majesty--
- So... he's proposed already!

786
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:33,567
- Tell me all about it.- Well, Sire--

787
00:55:33,568 --> 00:55:34,944
Who is she?
Where does she Iive?

788
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,950
- Well, I didn't get a chance--- No matter.

789
00:55:37,313 --> 00:55:38,688
We've more important things to discuss.

790
00:55:38,882 --> 00:55:42,528
Arrangements for the wedding,
invitations, a national holiday.

791
00:55:44,004 --> 00:55:45,249
- All that sort of thing.
- But, but, Sire--

792
00:55:45,861 --> 00:55:47,967
Here, here, have a cigar. Take a few more.

793
00:55:48,455 --> 00:55:49,320
ha...

794
00:55:49,351 --> 00:55:50,147
But, but, but--

795
00:55:50,344 --> 00:55:52,068
Better practice passing these out, eh?

796
00:55:52,424 --> 00:55:56,004
But, but, but, if you'd... only listen!

797
00:55:56,266 --> 00:55:57,609
And for you, my friend...

798
00:55:58,187 --> 00:55:59,300
Your, Your Majesty, p-p-please.

799
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:00,618
a knighthood!

800
00:56:01,741 --> 00:56:03,084
I hereby dub you Sir...

801
00:56:03,887 --> 00:56:04,716
Uh... um...

802
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,466
By the way, what title would you like?

803
00:56:08,177 --> 00:56:10,633
- Sire, she got away, sir.
- She got away?

804
00:56:11,475 --> 00:56:13,363
A peculiar title, but if thatÂ’s what you--

805
00:56:14,196 --> 00:56:15,538
She what?

806
00:56:16,149 --> 00:56:18,833
Why you, you... you traitor!

807
00:56:19,063 --> 00:56:21,682
Now, Sire, remember your...
your blood pressure.

808
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:24,721
Traitor!

809
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:27,189
No, Sire, no!

810
00:56:28,443 --> 00:56:29,524
Sabotage!

811
00:56:31,356 --> 00:56:32,819
You were in Ieague with the Prince all along!

812
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:34,419
I tried to stop her...

813
00:56:34,686 --> 00:56:36,923
but she vanished into thin air!

814
00:56:37,152 --> 00:56:39,641
- A IikeIy story!
- But itÂ’s true, Sire!

815
00:56:40,225 --> 00:56:42,114
All we could find was this glass slipper.

816
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:44,383
The whole thing was a plot!

817
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:47,332
But, Sire, he Ioves her.

818
00:56:47,813 --> 00:56:49,821
He won't rest 'tiI he finds her.

819
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,520
He's determined to marry her.

820
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,620
What? What did you say?

821
00:56:56,489 --> 00:56:59,753
The Prince, Sire, swears
he'll marry none but the girl...

822
00:57:00,331 --> 00:57:02,754
- who fits this slipper.
- He said that, did he?

823
00:57:03,885 --> 00:57:06,188
Ha-ha! We've got him!

824
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:08,044
Yahoo-o-o!

825
00:57:11,281 --> 00:57:14,512
But, Sire, this slipper
may fit any number of girls.

826
00:57:14,834 --> 00:57:17,072
That's his problem. He's given his word.

827
00:57:17,492 --> 00:57:19,501
- We'll hold him to it.
- No, no, Your Highness.

828
00:57:20,597 --> 00:57:22,005
I'll have nothing to do with it.

829
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:24,496
You'll try this on every maid in my kingdom,

830
00:57:25,272 --> 00:57:26,450
and if the shoe fits...

831
00:57:27,929 --> 00:57:28,944
bring her in!

832
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:32,211
Y-y-yes, Your Majesty.

833
00:57:45,314 --> 00:57:47,454
Cinderella! Cinderella?

834
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:49,774
Cinderella!

835
00:57:49,775 --> 00:57:51,260
- Oh, where is that--
- Yes? Here I am.

836
00:57:52,006 --> 00:57:53,949
Oh... my daughters, where are they?

837
00:57:54,279 --> 00:57:55,774
I... I think they're still in bed.

838
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:58,495
Oh... Well, don't just stand there.

839
00:57:59,177 --> 00:58:01,447
Bring up the breakfast
trays at once, and hurry!

840
00:58:03,115 --> 00:58:04,523
Uh-oh! Wonder what's the matter.

841
00:58:04,716 --> 00:58:06,408
Duh... duh... What's the matter with her?

842
00:58:06,765 --> 00:58:07,561
I donÂ’t know. Let's find out.

843
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:08,716
Come on!

844
00:58:16,722 --> 00:58:18,446
Drizella! Drizella!

845
00:58:19,124 --> 00:58:20,302
What?

846
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,607
Get up! Quick! This instant!

847
00:58:23,062 --> 00:58:24,175
We haven't a moment to Iose.

848
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:28,407
Anastasia? Anastasia.

849
00:58:31,546 --> 00:58:32,659
Get up, Anastasia!

850
00:58:33,915 --> 00:58:35,476
What for? Why?

851
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,448
Oh, everyone's talking about it
the whole kingdom. Hurry now!

852
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:41,139
- He'll be here any minute.
- Who will?

853
00:58:41,567 --> 00:58:44,121
The Grand Duke. He's been hunting all night.

854
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:45,846
- Hunting?
- For that girl.

855
00:58:46,466 --> 00:58:48,409
The one who Iost her slipper
at the ball Iast night.

856
00:58:48,995 --> 00:58:50,621
They say he's madly in love with her.

857
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:53,852
- The Duke is?
- No, no, no! The Prince!

858
00:58:54,725 --> 00:58:56,766
The Prince!

859
00:58:58,311 --> 00:58:59,653
You clumsy little fool!

860
00:59:00,488 --> 00:59:03,010
Clean that up, and then
help my daughters dress.

861
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:04,322
What for?

862
00:59:05,067 --> 00:59:08,614
If heÂ’s in Iove with that girl,
why should we even bother?

863
00:59:09,005 --> 00:59:10,347
Now, you two, Iisten to me!

864
00:59:11,598 --> 00:59:13,803
There is still a chance
that one of you can get him.

865
00:59:14,672 --> 00:59:15,752
What? One of us?

866
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:17,929
Why, Mother, what do you mean?

867
00:59:18,162 --> 00:59:21,295
Just this. No one, not even the Prince,

868
00:59:21,811 --> 00:59:23,240
knows who that girl is.

869
00:59:23,412 --> 00:59:24,591
We do! We do! Cinderelly, Cinder--

870
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:27,502
The glass slipper is their only clue.

871
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:31,792
The Duke has been ordered to try it
on every girl in the kingdom,

872
00:59:32,249 --> 00:59:35,283
and if one can be found
whom the slipper fits, then...

873
00:59:35,995 --> 00:59:39,771
by the King's command, that girl
shall be the Prince's bride.

874
00:59:40,829 --> 00:59:42,878
Bride... Bride!

875
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:44,628
Cinderella, get my things together.

876
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,588
Never mind her, mend these right away!

877
00:59:46,912 --> 00:59:48,342
Not until she irons my dress!

878
00:59:48,865 --> 00:59:50,720
- Mend these.
- After she's brushed my shoes.

879
00:59:51,523 --> 00:59:52,636
But first get my new--

880
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:56,254
W-w-what's the matter with her?

881
00:59:56,741 --> 00:59:59,492
- Wake up, stupid!
- We've gotta get dressed!

882
01:00:00,134 --> 01:00:02,502
Dressed... Oh, yes...

883
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:06,020
We must get dressed. It would never do...

884
01:00:06,602 --> 01:00:07,365
for the Duke to see me looking like this.

885
01:00:07,659 --> 01:00:08,903
Mother, did you see what she did?

886
01:00:09,099 --> 01:00:10,627
- Are you just going to Iet--
- Quiet!

887
01:00:13,133 --> 01:00:14,989
So this is love

888
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:30,998
- What she gonna do?
- Shhh! I don't know.

889
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:32,588
Gotta watch her. Come on!

890
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,424
Ia, Ia...

891
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:57,407
- Cinderelly, Cinderelly!
- Cinderelly!

892
01:00:58,372 --> 01:01:00,762
- Look out, Iook out!
- So this is the miracle

893
01:01:02,086 --> 01:01:03,167
That I've been dreaming of

894
01:01:03,399 --> 01:01:05,855
- Cinderelly, look out!
- Behind you, behind you!

895
01:01:06,249 --> 01:01:07,394
- Look behind you, Cinderelly!
- What?

896
01:01:10,923 --> 01:01:12,101
Oh! Oh, no!

897
01:01:12,716 --> 01:01:13,927
No, please!

898
01:01:14,316 --> 01:01:16,805
Oh, you canÂ’t! You just can't!

899
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:17,993
Let me out! You must Iet me out!

900
01:01:18,959 --> 01:01:20,090
oh... ho...

901
01:01:20,207 --> 01:01:21,669
You can't keep me in here!

902
01:01:22,961 --> 01:01:24,555
Please...

903
01:01:25,362 --> 01:01:27,086
No, no! She can't do it!

904
01:01:27,347 --> 01:01:29,006
She can't Iock up Cinderelly! I'm gonna--

905
01:01:30,068 --> 01:01:31,279
Oh, please, please.

906
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:35,442
We gotta get that key, Gus-Gus.
We just gotta get that key.

907
01:01:41,242 --> 01:01:41,940
Whoa!

908
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:49,366
He's-a here, he's-a here! A Duke-Duke!

909
01:01:49,759 --> 01:01:52,411
- Duh... duh... a who?
- A Grand Duke with the slipper.

910
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,355
- Gotta get that key quick!
- Zuk-zuk key-key quick-quick.

911
01:01:57,570 --> 01:01:59,676
Oh, Mother, Mother. He's here!

912
01:02:00,003 --> 01:02:01,248
- He's here!
- The Grand Duke!

913
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:03,744
Do I Iook all right? I'm so excited, I just--

914
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:06,275
Girls, now remember...

915
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:08,637
this is your Iast chance. Don't fail me.

916
01:02:13,131 --> 01:02:16,548
Announcing His Imperial
Grace, the Grand Duke.

917
01:02:18,092 --> 01:02:19,522
You honour our humble home, m'Lord.

918
01:02:20,013 --> 01:02:20,810
Ahem. Quite so.

919
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,301
May I present my daughters,

920
01:02:23,984 --> 01:02:26,571
Drizella and Anastasia.

921
01:02:27,026 --> 01:02:27,757
Your Grace.

922
01:02:30,131 --> 01:02:31,538
Ladies, charmed I'm sure.

923
01:02:32,596 --> 01:02:34,604
His Grace will read a royal proclamation.

924
01:02:38,007 --> 01:02:40,877
All IoyaI subjects of His
Imperial Majesty are hereby...

925
01:02:41,113 --> 01:02:43,121
notified by royal proclamation
in regard to a certain...

926
01:02:44,122 --> 01:02:49,624
glass... slipper.
It is upon this day decreed--

927
01:02:49,949 --> 01:02:51,543
Why, that's my slipper!

928
01:02:52,638 --> 01:02:54,843
Well, I like that! It... it's my slipper!

929
01:02:55,392 --> 01:02:57,782
No, No! Cinderelly's
slipper! Cinderelly's slip--

930
01:02:57,985 --> 01:03:00,801
- How can she--- Girls, girls, girls!

931
01:03:01,795 --> 01:03:02,972
Your manners.

932
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:05,983
A thousand pardons, Your Grace.

933
01:03:06,502 --> 01:03:07,233
Please continue.

934
01:03:07,975 --> 01:03:08,869
Yes, quite so.

935
01:03:11,336 --> 01:03:13,279
It is upon this day decreed
that a quest be instituted...

936
01:03:13,705 --> 01:03:15,135
throughout the Iength
and breadth of our domain...

937
01:03:15,915 --> 01:03:18,633
the sole and express purpose
of said quest to be as follows:

938
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:22,890
That every single maiden
in our beloved kingdom,

939
01:03:23,054 --> 01:03:24,997
without prearranged exception,
shall try upon her foot...

940
01:03:25,391 --> 01:03:26,569
this aforementioned slipper of glass.

941
01:03:26,735 --> 01:03:28,230
And should one be found upon whose foot said
slipper...

942
01:03:28,401 --> 01:03:29,776
shall properly fit...

943
01:03:33,619 --> 01:03:36,009
such maiden shall be acclaimed
the object of this search...

944
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:37,518
and immediately forthwith
shall be looked upon...

945
01:03:37,813 --> 01:03:38,991
as the one and only true love
of His Royal Highness,

946
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:40,758
our beloved son and heir,

947
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,412
the Noble Prince.

948
01:03:44,473 --> 01:03:45,968
Said Noble Prince will humbly
and upon bended knee...

949
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,737
beg, request, or if need be, implore...

950
01:03:48,763 --> 01:03:51,317
said maiden, that they
grant her hand in marriage.

951
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:53,844
Well...Whereupon,

952
01:03:54,045 --> 01:03:55,704
should the aforementioned maide
look with favour upon his suit,

953
01:03:56,031 --> 01:03:57,144
then shall the happy couple
pledge their troth...

954
01:03:58,208 --> 01:03:59,190
on... uh...

955
01:04:00,033 --> 01:04:02,882
And in due course,
upon the inevitable demise...

956
01:04:03,427 --> 01:04:04,442
of His Most Gracious
and August Majesty, the King,

957
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,559
succeed to the throne,
there to rule over all the land...

958
01:04:06,788 --> 01:04:08,032
as Kingsland Queen of our beloved kingdom.

959
01:04:08,517 --> 01:04:10,460
Oh... So be it.

960
01:04:13,255 --> 01:04:15,395
You must be quite fatigued, Your Grace.

961
01:04:15,849 --> 01:04:17,027
May we offer you some tea?

962
01:04:17,578 --> 01:04:19,335
What? Tea?

963
01:04:20,779 --> 01:04:21,892
Thank you, madam, no.

964
01:04:23,212 --> 01:04:25,123
We must proceed with the... the fitting.

965
01:04:25,518 --> 01:04:27,908
Of course. Anastasia, dear.

966
01:04:31,441 --> 01:04:34,061
There! I knew it was my slipper.

967
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:35,949
Exactly my size.

968
01:04:36,884 --> 01:04:38,291
I always wear the same size.

969
01:04:38,644 --> 01:04:40,074
As soon as I saw it, I said--

970
01:04:40,597 --> 01:04:44,210
Oh! Well... it... it may be
a trifle snug today.

971
01:04:44,824 --> 01:04:46,548
You know how it is... dancing all night.

972
01:04:47,609 --> 01:04:48,438
I can't understand why.

973
01:04:49,498 --> 01:04:50,905
It's always fit perfectly before.

974
01:04:52,027 --> 01:04:53,522
I donÂ’t think you're half trying!

975
01:04:53,916 --> 01:04:56,186
- Mother, can you--
- Shhh. Be quiet, my dear.

976
01:04:57,406 --> 01:04:59,709
We mustn't disturb His Grace.

977
01:05:00,383 --> 01:05:03,102
Young man, are you sure you're
trying it on the right foot?

978
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:08,473
Oh, it's the right foot, but
it must have shrunk or something.

979
01:05:08,932 --> 01:05:11,072
A glass shoe isn't always reliable.

980
01:05:11,621 --> 01:05:13,051
Come on, Gus-Gus. Hurry! Up the stairs!

981
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:14,831
Up the stairs!

982
01:05:49,272 --> 01:05:51,029
Why can't you hold still a minute?

983
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:52,824
Oh, my word!

984
01:05:53,435 --> 01:05:54,199
Enough of this!

985
01:05:57,084 --> 01:05:58,361
The next young Iady, please.

986
01:05:59,261 --> 01:06:00,309
Hear that, Gus? Hear that?

987
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:02,296
- Yup.
- Quick. Gotta hurry!

988
01:06:09,026 --> 01:06:09,855
Come on, come on! Hurry!

989
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:21,952
. Gus-Gus, Gus-Gus. Aw, come on.
Look, Look. It's just up there

990
01:06:22,313 --> 01:06:23,341
Come on!

991
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:32,554
Us a-comin', Cinderelly.

992
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:34,442
Us a-comin'! Us'll get you out.

993
01:06:34,671 --> 01:06:38,088
You've got the key.
How did you ever manage it?

994
01:06:39,474 --> 01:06:42,771
Lucifer! Let him go, Lucifer!

995
01:06:43,635 --> 01:06:44,945
Please, let him go!

996
01:06:46,037 --> 01:06:48,275
- Let him go.
- Let him go! Let him out!

997
01:06:48,598 --> 01:06:51,054
Let him out! Here! Here, R-ucifee!

998
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:29,542
Bruno!

999
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,300
Yes! Bruno!

1000
01:07:32,301 --> 01:07:34,189
Quick! Get Bruno! Get Bruno!

1001
01:07:54,392 --> 01:07:57,263
Oh, of all the stupid little idiots!

1002
01:07:57,817 --> 01:07:59,345
I'll do it myself!

1003
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:01,392
Get away from me!

1004
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:03,129
I'll make it fit!

1005
01:08:05,501 --> 01:08:06,363
There!

1006
01:08:06,686 --> 01:08:07,799
- It fit!
- It fits?

1007
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:20,698
Oh, Your Grace, I'm dreadfully sorry.

1008
01:08:21,382 --> 01:08:22,495
It shan't happen again.

1009
01:08:22,759 --> 01:08:23,686
Precisely, madam.

1010
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,435
Come on, come on! Get up, Gus-Gus!

1011
01:08:51,733 --> 01:08:52,432
Get up, get up!

1012
01:08:52,757 --> 01:08:54,067
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

1013
01:08:55,255 --> 01:08:56,117
Let go, let go!

1014
01:09:01,626 --> 01:09:04,661
You are the only ladies
of the household, I hope-- I presume.

1015
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:05,819
ThereÂ’s no one else, Your Grace.

1016
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:07,675
Quite so. Good day.

1017
01:09:08,062 --> 01:09:09,306
- Good day!
- Your Grace!

1018
01:09:10,142 --> 01:09:11,371
Your Grace!

1019
01:09:11,467 --> 01:09:14,077
Please! Wait! May I try it on?

1020
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:16,000
Oh, pay no attention to her.

1021
01:09:16,321 --> 01:09:18,264
- It's only Cinderella.- Our scullery maid.

1022
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:19,676
- From the kitchen.
- It's ridiculous.

1023
01:09:19,715 --> 01:09:20,740
- Impossible.
- SheÂ’s out of her mind.

1024
01:09:20,836 --> 01:09:23,106
Yes, yes. Just an imaginative child.

1025
01:09:23,589 --> 01:09:26,307
Madam, my orders were every maiden!

1026
01:09:27,976 --> 01:09:28,772
Come, my child.

1027
01:09:44,015 --> 01:09:47,115
Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no!

1028
01:09:47,313 --> 01:09:50,577
Oh, no! This is terrible. The King!

1029
01:09:51,219 --> 01:09:51,983
What will he say?

1030
01:09:53,012 --> 01:09:54,125
What will he do?

1031
01:09:54,645 --> 01:09:56,075
But perhaps, if it would help--

1032
01:09:56,534 --> 01:09:59,470
No, no. Nothing can help now, nothing.

1033
01:09:59,639 --> 01:10:01,396
But, you see, I have the other slipper.

1034
01:10:38,348 --> 01:10:42,506
Have faith in dreams and someday

1035
01:10:43,438 --> 01:10:48,776
Your rainbow will come smiling through

1036
01:10:49,105 --> 01:10:53,035
No matter how your heart is grieving

1037
01:10:53,555 --> 01:10:56,753
If you keep on believing

1038
01:10:57,685 --> 01:11:03,951
The dreams that you wish
will come true.
