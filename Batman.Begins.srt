-Why haven't we feIt the effects?

...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

Well, we both care for Rachel, but what

It's a bit technical.

How long would it take

Weeks. Why?

1163
01:42:09,706 --> 01:42:12,875
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1164
01:42:13,877 --> 01:42:16,963
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

A microwave emitter like the one

Misplaced?

But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

Are his methods supernatural?

Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

His toxin is derived from the organic

He was able to weaponize it.

He's not a member of

Of course not. He thought our plan

Over the ages our weapons

With Gotham we tried a new one.

EARLE: What are you talking about?</i>

1405
02:05:42,243 --> 02:05:44,118
The company went public a week ago.

1406
02:05:44,286 --> 02:05:45,745
And I bought most of the shares.

1407
02:05:46,121 --> 02:05:49,582
<i>Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.</i>

1408
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:52,961
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1409
02:05:53,128 --> 02:05:56,464
<i>...is that my company's future
is secure.</i>

1410
02:05:56,799 --> 02:05:58,258
Right, Mr. Fox?

1411
02:05:58,425 --> 02:06:00,260
FOX:
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1412
02:06:02,471 --> 02:06:04,055
Didn't you get the memo?

1413
02:06:22,992 --> 02:06:26,160
-I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
-No. No, Bruce...

1414
02:06:26,328 --> 02:06:27,745
...I'm sorry.

1415
02:06:28,622 --> 02:06:31,291
The day that Chill died, l....

1416
02:06:33,168 --> 02:06:34,794
I said terrible things.

1417
02:06:35,296 --> 02:06:37,046
But true things.

1418
02:06:37,673 --> 02:06:39,507
I was a coward with a gun...

1419
02:06:39,675 --> 02:06:43,469
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1420
02:06:44,513 --> 02:06:47,181
I never stopped thinking about you.

1421
02:06:48,684 --> 02:06:50,310
About us.

1422
02:06:50,936 --> 02:06:52,854
And when I heard you were back, l....

1423
02:06:53,689 --> 02:06:55,940
I started to hope.

1424
02:07:20,007 --> 02:07:22,717
But then I found out about your mask.

1425
02:07:23,886 --> 02:07:26,721
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1426
02:07:27,348 --> 02:07:29,015
No. This...

1427
02:07:30,184 --> 02:07:31,893
...is your mask.

1428
02:07:33,854 --> 02:07:37,398
Your real face is the one
that criminaIs now fear.

1429
02:07:38,233 --> 02:07:40,234
The man I loved...

1430
02:07:40,903 --> 02:07:42,403
...the man who vanished...

1431
02:07:43,614 --> 02:07:45,740
...he never came back at all.

1432
02:07:50,245 --> 02:07:52,914
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1433
02:07:55,084 --> 02:07:58,753
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1434
02:07:59,838 --> 02:08:01,756
...I'll see him again.

1435
02:08:12,851 --> 02:08:15,770
-Proved me wrong, you know.
-About what?

1436
02:08:18,607 --> 02:08:21,067
Your father would be very proud of you.

1437
02:08:21,276 --> 02:08:22,902
Just like me.

1438
02:08:49,888 --> 02:08:51,764
RACHEL:
What will you do?

1439
02:08:53,142 --> 02:08:54,726
Rebuild it.

1440
02:08:55,602 --> 02:08:57,979
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1441
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:06,070
Just the way it was, sir?

1442
02:09:08,157 --> 02:09:09,407
Yeah, why?

1443
02:09:09,575 --> 02:09:12,410
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1444
02:09:12,578 --> 02:09:14,996
...improving the foundations.

1445
02:09:15,205 --> 02:09:18,166
-In the southeast corner?
-Precisely, sir.

1446
02:09:33,849 --> 02:09:36,726
-Nice.
-I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1447
02:09:37,686 --> 02:09:40,354
BATMAN: Well, sergeant?
-It's "lieutenant" now.

1448
02:09:40,731 --> 02:09:42,190
You really started something.

1449
02:09:42,357 --> 02:09:44,358
Bent cops running scared.

1450
02:09:44,526 --> 02:09:45,985
Hope on the streets.

1451
02:09:46,236 --> 02:09:49,864
-But?
-The Narrows is lost.

1452
02:09:50,365 --> 02:09:54,202
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
haIf the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1453
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:56,537
We will.

1454
02:09:56,747 --> 02:09:58,372
We can bring Gotham back.

1455
02:09:58,540 --> 02:10:01,042
-What about escalation?
-Escalation?

1456
02:10:01,251 --> 02:10:05,546
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1457
02:10:05,756 --> 02:10:10,051
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1458
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:13,554
-And?
-And you're wearing a mask...

1459
02:10:13,972 --> 02:10:15,848
...and jumping off rooftops.

1460
02:10:17,267 --> 02:10:19,310
Now, take this guy.

1461
02:10:19,561 --> 02:10:21,562
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1462
02:10:21,772 --> 02:10:25,024
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1463
02:10:25,275 --> 02:10:27,235
Leaves a calling card.

1464
02:10:33,075 --> 02:10:34,909
I'll look into it.

1465
02:10:38,413 --> 02:10:39,872
I never said thank you.

1466
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:47,046
And you'll never have to.

1467
02:19:58,723 --> 02:20:00,724
