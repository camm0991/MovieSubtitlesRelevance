1
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:48,386
Starling!

2
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:51,889
Starling!

3
00:02:54,977 --> 00:02:57,645
Crawford wants to see you 
in his office.

4
00:02:58,021 --> 00:02:59,438
Thank you, sir.

5
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:48,904
- Clarice.
- Hey.

6
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,663
... so there shouldn't be 
any problem if you could ...

7
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:41,248
- You looking for Crawford?
- Yes, sir.

8
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,876
He should be back in a couple minutes.
Why don't you wait in his office?

9
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,962
- Okay.
- And I think they were over in Flushing ...

10
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:42,893
Starling,

11
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:45,855
Clarice M. Good morning.

12
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:47,356
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

13
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:50,776
Sorry to pull you off of the 
course at such short notice.

14
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,820
Your instructors tell me 
you're doing well.

15
00:05:52,863 --> 00:05:54,864
- Top quarter of your class.
- I hope so.

16
00:05:54,906 --> 00:05:57,408
They haven't posted any grades yet.

17
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:00,244
A job's come up, 
and I thought about you.

18
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:03,205
Not a job, really.
More of an interesting errand.

19
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,540
Sit down.

20
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,208
Yes, sir.

21
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:10,212
I remember you 
from my seminar at UVA.

22
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,215
You grilled me pretty hard, 
as I recall,

23
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,801
on the Bureau's civil rights 
record in the Hoover years.

24
00:06:15,886 --> 00:06:17,219
I gave you an "A."

25
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:18,721
A-minus, sir.

26
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,643
Let's see. Double major, psych 
and criminology. Graduated magna.

27
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:27,396
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.

28
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:29,398
It says here when you graduate,

29
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:32,485
you want to come to work for me
in Behavioral Science.

30
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:34,737
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

31
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:38,866
We're interviewing all the serial 
killers now in custody ...

32
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:41,035
for a psycho-behavioral profile.

33
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:43,787
It could be a real help 
in unsolved cases.

34
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:46,749
Most of them have been
happy to talk to us.

35
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,001
Do you spook easily, Starling?

36
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:50,711
Not yet, sir.

37
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:53,881
See, the one we want most,
refuses to cooperate.

38
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:56,759
I want you to go after him again 
today in the asylum.

39
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:58,427
And who's the subject?

40
00:06:58,512 --> 00:07:00,804
The psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter.

41
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:02,932
Hannibal the Cannibal.

42
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:05,935
I don't expect him to talk to you,

43
00:07:07,437 --> 00:07:10,105
but I have to be able 
to say we tried.

44
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:13,192
So if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting.

45
00:07:13,276 --> 00:07:15,277
How's he look? How's his cell look?

46
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:16,987
Is he sketching, drawing?

47
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:19,281
If he is, what's he sketching?

48
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:25,037
Here's a dossier on Lecter.

49
00:07:27,624 --> 00:07:30,960
A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.

50
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:33,963
Have your memo on my desk
by 08:00 Wednesday.

51
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:35,214
Okay.

52
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:40,803
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

53
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:42,846
Lecter's been in prison
for so many years now.

54
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:46,141
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?

55
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:47,810
I wish there were.

56
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:51,939
- I want your full attention, Starling.
- Yes, sir.

57
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:54,733
Be very careful 
with Hannibal Lecter.

58
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:56,610
Dr. Chilton at the asylum ...

59
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:59,822
will go over all the physical 
procedures used with him.

60
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:03,158
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever,

61
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:06,203
and you're to tell him
nothing personal, Starling.

62
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:09,873
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

63
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,960
Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.

64
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:14,253
And what is that?

65
00:08:14,713 --> 00:08:16,463
Oh, he's a monster.

66
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:18,465
A pure psychopath.

67
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:21,302
So rare to capture one alive.

68
00:08:21,428 --> 00:08:25,306
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

69
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:27,933
Well.

70
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:32,187
You know, we get a lot of 
detectives here, but I must say,

71
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:34,898
I can't ever remember 
one as attractive.

72
00:08:36,985 --> 00:08:39,570
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

73
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,991
Because this can be quite a fun 
town if you have the right guide.

74
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:47,745
Well, I'm sure
this is a great town, Dr. Chilton,

75
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:52,708
but my instructions are to talk to
Dr. Lecter and report back this afternoon.

76
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:54,209
I see.

77
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:56,545
Let's make this quick, then.

78
00:08:56,713 --> 00:08:58,380
We've tried to study him, 
of course,

79
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:01,383
but he's much too sophisticated
for the standard tests.

80
00:09:01,426 --> 00:09:03,802
Oh, my, does he hate us!

81
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:05,888
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

82
00:09:07,432 --> 00:09:10,392
Crawford's very clever, 
isn't he? Using you.

83
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:11,810
What do you mean, sir?

84
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:14,605
A pretty young woman 
to turn him on.

85
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:17,941
I don't believe Lecter's even 
seen a woman in eight years.

86
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:20,277
And, oh, are you ever his taste.

87
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,904
So to speak.

88
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:25,157
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It is not a charm school.

89
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:28,452
Good. Then you should be able
to remember the rules.

90
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:33,749
Do not touch the glass.
Do not approach the glass.

91
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:37,169
You pass him nothing but soft paper.
No pencils or pens.

92
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:39,380
No staples or paper clips 
on his paper.

93
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:41,799
Use the sliding food carrier.
No exceptions.

94
00:09:41,883 --> 00:09:44,259
If he attempts to pass you 
anything, do not accept it.

95
00:09:44,344 --> 00:09:47,262
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand, sir.

96
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:51,517
I'm going to show you why we 
insist on such precautions.

97
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:54,228
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981,

98
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:57,272
he complained of chest pains
and was taken to the dispensary.

99
00:09:57,315 --> 00:10:00,025
His mouthpiece and restraints
were removed for an EKG.

100
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,945
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

101
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:08,951
The doctors managed to reset 
her jaw, more or less,

102
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:10,536
save one of her eyes.

103
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,830
His pulse never got above 85,

104
00:10:13,373 --> 00:10:15,290
even when he ate her tongue.

105
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:17,960
I keep him in here.

106
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:19,586
Dr. Chilton.

107
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,466
If Lecter feels 
that you're his enemy,

108
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:28,262
then, well, maybe we'll have 
more luck if I go in by myself.

109
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,013
What do you think?

110
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:36,729
You might have suggested this in 
my office and saved me the time.

111
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:42,317
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

112
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:47,614
When she's finished, bring her out.

113
00:11:15,894 --> 00:11:17,436
Hi. I'm Barney.

114
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:20,522
He told you, 
don't get near the glass?

115
00:11:20,982 --> 00:11:23,025
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

116
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:25,068
Nice to meet you, Clarice.

117
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:27,654
You can hang your coat 
up here if you like.

118
00:11:27,697 --> 00:11:29,364
Thank you. I will.

119
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:33,786
He's past the others. 
The last cell.

120
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,704
You keep to the right.

121
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:39,875
I put out a chair for you.

122
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,503
Oh, yes. That's very good. 
Thank you.

123
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:46,548
I'll be watching. You'll do fine.

124
00:11:57,227 --> 00:11:58,477
Hi.

125
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:19,456
I can smell your cunt.

126
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:34,471
Good morning.

127
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:38,517
Dr. Lecter, my name  is Clarice Starling.
May I speak with you?

128
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:41,603
You're one of 
Jack Crawford's, aren't you?

129
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:43,021
I am, yes, sir.

130
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:46,149
May I see your credentials?

131
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:47,860
Certainly.

132
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:56,451
Closer, please.

133
00:12:58,371 --> 00:12:59,997
Closer.

134
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,806
That expires in one week.

135
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:20,601
You're not real FBI, are you?

136
00:13:20,894 --> 00:13:23,395
I'm still in training at the Academy.

137
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:27,107
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

138
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:29,484
Yes. I'm a student.

139
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:31,820
I'm here to learn from you.

140
00:13:31,905 --> 00:13:33,238
Maybe you can decide for yourself ...

141
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:36,408
whether or not I'm qualified 
enough to do that.

142
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:41,663
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

143
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:46,877
Sit, please.

144
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:56,011
Now, then. Tell me,

145
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:58,347
what did Miggs say to you?

146
00:13:58,514 --> 00:14:00,933
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

147
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:02,893
He hissed at you.

148
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:04,561
What did he say?

149
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:08,690
He said, "I can smell your cunt."

150
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:10,233
I see.

151
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:13,528
I myself cannot.

152
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:25,207
You use Evyan skin cream.

153
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:30,712
And sometimes 
you wear L'Air du Temps,

154
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:33,632
but not today.

155
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:38,345
Did you do 
all these drawings, Doctor?

156
00:14:40,932 --> 00:14:44,101
That is the Duomo,
seen from the Belvedere.

157
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:47,229
You know Florence?

158
00:14:48,314 --> 00:14:50,565
All that detail 
just from memory, sir?

159
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:54,528
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

160
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,737
Well,

161
00:14:55,822 --> 00:15:00,659
perhaps you'd care to lend us your 
view on this questionnaire, sir.

162
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:03,078
Oh, no, no, no.

163
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:05,205
You were doing fine.

164
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:08,417
You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy.

165
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:13,088
You had established trust with the 
embarrassing truth about Miggs.

166
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:17,342
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

167
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:20,429
It won't do.

168
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:22,723
I'm only asking you 
to look at this, Doctor.

169
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:24,891
Either you will or you won't.

170
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:26,018
Yeah.

171
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:28,770
Jack Crawford 
must be very busy indeed,

172
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:31,690
if he is recruiting help
from the student body.

173
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:34,609
Busy hunting that new one, 
Buffalo Bill.

174
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:36,778
What a naughty boy he is.

175
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,699
Do you know 
why he's called Buffalo Bill?

176
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:43,952
Please tell me. 
The newspapers won't say.

177
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:47,873
Well, it started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

178
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:51,710
They said,
"This one likes to skin his humps."

179
00:15:53,296 --> 00:15:57,215
Why do you think 
he removes their skins,

180
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,800
Agent Starling?

181
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:01,053
Enthrall me with your acumen.

182
00:16:01,804 --> 00:16:03,346
It excites him.

183
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:07,434
Most serial killers keep some sort 
of trophies from their victims.

184
00:16:07,477 --> 00:16:08,810
I didn't.

185
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:10,020
No.

186
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:11,772
No, you ate yours.

187
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:16,359
You send that through now.

188
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:44,429
Oh, Agent Starling,

189
00:16:44,514 --> 00:16:48,016
you think you can dissect me
with this blunt, little tool?

190
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,601
No.

191
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,561
I thought that your knowledge ...

192
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:53,897
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

193
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:55,524
You know what you look like to me ...

194
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:58,026
with your good bag 
and your cheap shoes?

195
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,861
You look like a rube.

196
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:04,324
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.

197
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:07,536
Good nutrition has given you
some length of bone,

198
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,956
but you're not more than one 
generation from poor white trash,

199
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,958
are you, Agent Starling?

200
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:15,877
And that accent you've tried
so desperately to shed,

201
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,629
pure West Virginia.

202
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:20,507
What does your father do?
Is he a coal miner?

203
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,592
Does he stink of the lamp?

204
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:25,303
And, oh, how quickly 
the boys found you.

205
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:28,932
All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,

206
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:32,769
while you could only dream
of getting out, getting anywhere,

207
00:17:32,854 --> 00:17:36,565
getting all the way to the FBI.

208
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,736
You see a lot, Doctor.

209
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:47,617
But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself?

210
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,162
What about it? Why don't you ...

211
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:53,832
Why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see?

212
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,501
Maybe you're afraid to.

213
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:08,889
A census-taker 
once tried to test me.

214
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:12,642
I ate his liver 
with some fava beans,

215
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:14,769
and a nice Chianti.

216
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:26,489
You fly back to school now, 
little Starling.

217
00:18:27,116 --> 00:18:28,658
Fly, fly, fly.

218
00:18:43,716 --> 00:18:47,469
I bit my wrist so I could die.

219
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,805
Look at the blood!

220
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:52,515
Gotcha!

221
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,644
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

222
00:18:58,022 --> 00:18:59,606
Hannibal the Cannibal!

223
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:01,274
Agent Starling! Come back!

224
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:03,568
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!

225
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:05,237
I would not have had 
that happen to you.

226
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:07,113
Discourtesy is 
unspeakably ugly to me.

227
00:19:07,156 --> 00:19:09,824
- Then do this test for me.
- No, but I will make you happy.

228
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:11,701
I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.

229
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:13,745
- And what is that, Doctor?
- Advancement, of course.

230
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:17,457
Now listen carefully. Look deep
within yourself, Clarice Starling.

231
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,378
Go seek out Miss Mofet, an old 
patient of mine. M-o-f-e-t. Go now.

232
00:19:21,462 --> 00:19:22,504
Doctor.

233
00:19:22,546 --> 00:19:23,964
I don't think Miggs could manage 
again quite so soon,

234
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,257
even though he is crazy.

235
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:26,675
Go now!

236
00:20:08,426 --> 00:20:09,718
Hey, Bill.

237
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:14,389
Hey.

238
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:16,599
- Daddy!
- Hey, Clarice.

239
00:20:18,144 --> 00:20:19,477
How are you?

240
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:22,439
Did you get any bad guys 
today, Daddy?

241
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:25,525
- No, angel, they all got away.
- Aw, shoot.

242
00:20:46,005 --> 00:20:48,381
FBI! Hands up! Don't move!

243
00:20:48,424 --> 00:20:49,591
Turn around!

244
00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:52,010
Hands behind your back! 
Thumbs up.

245
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:57,599
You're dead, Starling.

246
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:01,144
Johnson, good job.
Good entry. Good commands.

247
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:03,271
- Starling, where's your danger area?
- In the corner, sir.

248
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:04,731
- Did you check the corner?
- No, sir.

249
00:21:04,774 --> 00:21:05,940
That's the reason you're dead.

250
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,817
3109.

251
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:09,319
3109.

252
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:13,615
Breaking doors or windows
to enter or exit.

253
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:16,117
Rule 404 ...

254
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,889
- Clarice, phone. It's the guru.
- Crawford?

255
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:39,265
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Ardelia.

256
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,226
- Starling?
- Sir?

257
00:21:42,228 --> 00:21:43,686
Miggs is dead.

258
00:21:44,814 --> 00:21:47,440
Dead? How?

259
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:51,903
The orderly heard Lecter whispering
to him all afternoon, and Miggs crying.

260
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:55,657
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

261
00:21:57,535 --> 00:21:58,827
Starling?

262
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:01,162
Yeah, I'm still here, sir.

263
00:22:01,247 --> 00:22:04,207
I just ... I don't know
how to feel about this.

264
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:09,003
You don't have to feel any way about 
it. Lecter did it to amuse himself.

265
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:11,756
Look, I know it got ugly today,

266
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:15,176
but you mentioned a name
at the end. Mofet.

267
00:22:15,386 --> 00:22:17,137
Any follow-up on her?

268
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:20,682
Well, Lecter altered or destroyed
most of his patients' histories ...

269
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:23,351
prior to capture, so there's 
no record of anyone named Mofet.

270
00:22:23,394 --> 00:22:27,647
But I thought 
the "yourself" reference ...

271
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,315
was too hokey for Lecter,

272
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:33,695
so I figured, he's from Baltimore,
and I looked in the phone book,

273
00:22:33,737 --> 00:22:37,240
and there's a 
"Your Self Storage" facility,

274
00:22:37,324 --> 00:22:39,576
right outside of 
downtown Baltimore, sir.

275
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:45,665
Unit 31 was leased for 10 years,

276
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,459
prepaid in full.

277
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,960
The contract ...

278
00:22:49,044 --> 00:22:53,047
is in the name 
of a Miss Hester Mofet.

279
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:56,426
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

280
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:58,470
Not to my knowledge.

281
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,016
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

282
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:05,810
Yes, I won't disturb anything. 
I promise.

283
00:23:05,895 --> 00:23:08,354
I'll be out of here before you know it.

284
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:12,025
- Can I help you?
- Yes, actually, you can.

285
00:23:17,114 --> 00:23:18,406
It's stuck.

286
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:21,201
We could return tomorrow with my son.

287
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,911
What about him?

288
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:29,042
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labor.

289
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,085
Great.

290
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:34,714
You just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

291
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:08,248
It's stuck.

292
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,416
Hand me that flashlight, sir.

293
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:22,136
Oh.

294
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:28,309
If this door should fall down
or anything else,

295
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:32,772
this is the number
for our Baltimore field office.

296
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:34,649
Now, they know that you're with me.

297
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:36,818
You call them if 
anything should happen.

298
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,486
Yes, Miss Starling.

299
00:27:09,972 --> 00:27:10,972
Clarice ...

300
00:27:11,223 --> 00:27:14,183
- They're waiting for you. Watch yourself.
- Thank you.

301
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:18,396
Hester Mofet.
It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?

302
00:27:19,314 --> 00:27:22,650
Hester Mofet, "The rest of me."

303
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:26,362
"Miss The Rest Of Me,"
meaning that you rented that garage?

304
00:28:02,524 --> 00:28:03,816
Thank you.

305
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:06,402
Your bleeding has stopped.

306
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,031
How did you ...

307
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,159
It's nothing.

308
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:15,244
It's just a scratch.

309
00:28:16,538 --> 00:28:18,956
Dr. Lecter, 
whose head is in that bottle?

310
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:22,210
Why don't you ask me 
about Buffalo Bill?

311
00:28:22,377 --> 00:28:24,295
Why, do you know 
something about him?

312
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:26,506
I might, if I saw the case file.

313
00:28:26,548 --> 00:28:28,508
You could get that for me.

314
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,218
Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?

315
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:32,261
You wanted me to find him.

316
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:35,890
His real name is Benjamin Raspail.

317
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:38,184
A former patient of mine,

318
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:42,730
whose romantic attachments ran to,
shall we say, the exotic.

319
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:44,899
I did not kill him, I assure you.

320
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:47,693
Merely tucked him away
very much as I found him,

321
00:28:47,736 --> 00:28:50,279
after he'd missed 
three appointments.

322
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:53,783
If you didn't kill him, 
then who did, sir?

323
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:55,159
Who can say?

324
00:28:55,244 --> 00:28:56,911
Best thing for him, really.

325
00:28:56,995 --> 00:28:59,205
His therapy was going nowhere.

326
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:02,750
His dress, makeup ...

327
00:29:03,418 --> 00:29:05,211
Raspail was a transvestite?

328
00:29:05,254 --> 00:29:07,672
In life? Oh, no.

329
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:10,091
Garden variety manic-depressive.

330
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:12,218
Tedious. Very tedious.

331
00:29:12,761 --> 00:29:15,346
And I just think of him
as a kind of experiment,

332
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,808
a fledgling killer's first effort
at transformation.

333
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:21,769
How did you feel
when you saw him, Clarice?

334
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:24,272
Scared at first, then,

335
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:26,607
exhilarated.

336
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:29,569
Jack Crawford is helping your 
career, isn't he?

337
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:32,697
Apparently, he likes you,
and you like him, too.

338
00:29:33,115 --> 00:29:34,991
I never thought about it.

339
00:29:35,284 --> 00:29:38,244
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you sexually?

340
00:29:38,328 --> 00:29:39,871
True, he is much older,

341
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:43,583
but do you think he visualizes
scenarios, exchanges,

342
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:45,001
fucking you?

343
00:29:47,796 --> 00:29:49,297
That doesn't interest me, Doctor.

344
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:52,925
Frankly, it's the sort of thing
that Miggs would say.

345
00:29:54,887 --> 00:29:56,304
Not anymore.

346
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:05,646
Thank you, Barney.

347
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:11,903
What happened to your drawings?

348
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,531
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.

349
00:30:15,991 --> 00:30:17,867
Just like that gospel program.

350
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:20,995
When you leave,
they'll turn the volume way up.

351
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:24,123
Dr. Chilton does enjoy 
his petty torments.

352
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:27,793
What did you mean
by transformation, Doctor?

353
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:39,680
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

354
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,559
I know they will never,
ever let me out while I'm alive.

355
00:30:44,353 --> 00:30:46,187
What I want is a view.

356
00:30:46,688 --> 00:30:50,524
I want a window where I can 
see a tree, or even water.

357
00:30:50,692 --> 00:30:54,195
I want to be in a federal insti-
tution far away from Dr. Chilton.

358
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:56,822
What did you mean 
by fledgling killer?

359
00:30:57,115 --> 00:30:59,200
Are you saying 
that he's killed again?

360
00:30:59,242 --> 00:31:02,536
I'm offering you a psychological 
profile on Buffalo Bill,

361
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:04,664
based on the case evidence.

362
00:31:10,128 --> 00:31:12,505
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

363
00:31:19,262 --> 00:31:21,389
You know who he is, don't you?

364
00:31:22,265 --> 00:31:25,059
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, Doctor.

365
00:31:25,143 --> 00:31:27,853
All good things to those who wait.

366
00:31:28,397 --> 00:31:29,689
I've waited, Clarice,

367
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:32,608
but how long can you
and old Jackie boy wait?

368
00:31:33,068 --> 00:31:35,069
Our little Billy must 
already be searching ...

369
00:31:35,112 --> 00:31:38,197
for that next special lady.

370
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,220
Hey, little cheeper.

371
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:53,647
I'll be right there.

372
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:55,608
Oh, shoot.

373
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:03,908
Goddamn it.

374
00:33:13,085 --> 00:33:14,543
Perfect! Jesus.

375
00:33:20,383 --> 00:33:22,134
Can I help you with that?

376
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,262
- Would you?
- Sure.

377
00:33:26,348 --> 00:33:28,015
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

378
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,476
- You look kind of handicapped.
- Yeah.

379
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:33,813
I got it this far.
I just can't get it up in the truck.

380
00:33:33,855 --> 00:33:35,397
Here. Just grab this.

381
00:33:35,941 --> 00:33:36,982
Okay.

382
00:33:37,025 --> 00:33:39,193
Good. Just set it down. That's good.

383
00:33:39,945 --> 00:33:43,197
Get in the truck.
I want to push it all the way up.

384
00:33:43,949 --> 00:33:45,950
- I really appreciate this. Thank you.
- All right.

385
00:33:46,034 --> 00:33:47,618
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

386
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:50,204
Just go all the way back.

387
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,873
Okay. Is this good?

388
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,458
Yeah, that's good.

389
00:33:56,336 --> 00:33:58,504
- That's great.
- Okay.

390
00:33:59,005 --> 00:34:01,340
Say, are you about a size 14?

391
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:02,675
Sorry?

392
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:25,072
Good.

393
00:34:43,466 --> 00:34:47,219
Oh, good. Good.

394
00:35:03,195 --> 00:35:04,320
Hold!

395
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:18,125
Starling!

396
00:35:20,837 --> 00:35:22,546
Outside. Let's go.

397
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:26,634
Cindy, in the ring for Starling. 
Let's go!

398
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:36,894
FBI! Hold it! Hold it right there!

399
00:35:36,978 --> 00:35:38,687
Saddle up. Pack your field gear.
You're moving out.

400
00:35:38,772 --> 00:35:40,189
- You're going with Crawford.
- Where?

401
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:41,982
Found a girl's body down 
in West Virginia.

402
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:44,985
Been in the water about a week. Looks 
like a Buffalo Bill-type situation.

403
00:35:56,915 --> 00:36:00,042
He keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.

404
00:36:00,126 --> 00:36:03,295
There's no evidence of rape or 
physical abuse prior to death.

405
00:36:03,338 --> 00:36:06,382
All the mutilation you see there
is post-mortem.

406
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:08,425
Okay, three days.

407
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:12,179
Then he shoots them, skins them,
and dumps them.

408
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:14,265
Each body in a different river.

409
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:17,518
The water leaves us no trace 
evidence of any kind.

410
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:20,229
That's Fredrica Bimmel, 
the first one.

411
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:23,315
Her body was the only one he 
took the trouble to weight down,

412
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:26,110
so actually, 
she was the third girl found.

413
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:28,195
After her, he got lazy.

414
00:36:30,573 --> 00:36:33,033
Okay. Let's see.

415
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:35,703
Circles where 
the girls were abducted,

416
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:38,038
arrows where their bodies were found.

417
00:36:38,123 --> 00:36:41,292
This new one today washed up here.

418
00:36:41,376 --> 00:36:42,835
Elk River, West Virginia.

419
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:05,399
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

420
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:07,901
Well, he's a white male.

421
00:37:07,986 --> 00:37:11,655
Serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups.

422
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,781
He's not a drifter.

423
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:16,410
He's got his own house somewhere,
not an apartment.

424
00:37:16,745 --> 00:37:19,747
- Why?
- What he does with them takes privacy.

425
00:37:20,248 --> 00:37:22,291
He's in his 30s or 40s.

426
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,668
He's got real physical strength,

427
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:27,755
combined with an older 
man's self-control.

428
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,090
He's cautious, precise.

429
00:37:30,925 --> 00:37:33,761
And he's never impulsive. 
He'll never stop.

430
00:37:34,137 --> 00:37:35,387
Why not?

431
00:37:37,015 --> 00:37:40,601
He's got a real taste for it now.
He's getting better at his work.

432
00:37:42,187 --> 00:37:43,937
Not bad, Starling.

433
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:46,315
- Questions?
- Yes, sir.

434
00:37:47,192 --> 00:37:50,778
You haven't mentioned anything about the 
information contained in my report ...

435
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,946
or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

436
00:37:53,031 --> 00:37:54,782
I'm considering it.

437
00:37:54,949 --> 00:37:57,826
That's why you sent me 
in there, isn't it?

438
00:37:57,911 --> 00:38:00,079
To get his help 
on Buffalo Bill, sir?

439
00:38:03,124 --> 00:38:05,959
Well, if that was the case, 
then I just ...

440
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,754
I just wish I was in on it. 
That's all.

441
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:11,298
If I had sent you in there
with an actual agenda,

442
00:38:11,383 --> 00:38:13,258
Lecter would have 
known it instantly.

443
00:38:13,301 --> 00:38:16,637
He would have toyed with you,
then turned to stone.

444
00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:53,674
Excuse me. Sheriff Perkins, 
these are the FBI people.

445
00:38:53,842 --> 00:38:56,427
Sheriff Perkins. Jack Crawford, FBI.

446
00:38:56,761 --> 00:38:59,346
Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.

447
00:38:59,556 --> 00:39:02,015
We appreciate being invited
to your jurisdiction.

448
00:39:02,183 --> 00:39:05,394
I didn't call you. That was somebody
from the State Attorney's office.

449
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:07,646
We'll extend you every courtesy,
but right now ...

450
00:39:07,689 --> 00:39:12,151
Sheriff, this type of sex crime
has certain aspects.

451
00:39:12,193 --> 00:39:14,528
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

452
00:39:14,612 --> 00:39:16,405
You know what I mean?

453
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,685
- Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel.
- Yes, sir.

454
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:10,978
Starling, we're back here.

455
00:41:11,062 --> 00:41:14,189
Tell Lamar to come on when he's 
finished playing his music.

456
00:41:14,357 --> 00:41:14,481
Yeah. We'll be sending in a minute.

457
00:41:14,482 --> 00:41:16,900
Yeah. We'll be sending in a minute.

458
00:41:17,652 --> 00:41:18,860
Is this working?

459
00:41:18,945 --> 00:41:21,655
I need a six-way linkup.

460
00:41:21,698 --> 00:41:23,407
Chicago, Detroit ...

461
00:41:23,491 --> 00:41:24,866
What? What?

462
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:32,791
Excuse me! Excuse me, gentlemen.

463
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:35,127
You officers and gentlemen,
listen here now.

464
00:41:35,169 --> 00:41:36,795
There's things we need 
to do for her.

465
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:38,714
I know that you all 
brought her this far ...

466
00:41:38,798 --> 00:41:41,466
and that her folks would
thank you if they could ...

467
00:41:41,509 --> 00:41:43,844
for your kindness 
and your sensitivity.

468
00:41:43,886 --> 00:41:47,347
And now, please, go on now 
and let us take care of her.

469
00:41:48,057 --> 00:41:49,433
Go on, now.

470
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,854
Thank you.

471
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:58,942
Thank you.

472
00:42:00,695 --> 00:42:02,112
Okay, good.

473
00:42:10,371 --> 00:42:13,081
Yeah, that's right. 
West Virginia. Elk River.

474
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:15,208
Stand by for transmission.

475
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:20,172
Ray.

476
00:42:32,602 --> 00:42:35,354
Doctor, Lamar, 
let's take a look at her.

477
00:42:51,871 --> 00:42:53,205
Oh, Jesus.

478
00:43:00,963 --> 00:43:02,547
Okay, Starling.

479
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:08,720
Bill.

480
00:43:24,779 --> 00:43:29,241
Star-shaped contact entrance 
wound over the sternum.

481
00:43:31,452 --> 00:43:33,578
Muzzle stamp at the top.

482
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:36,081
- Wrongful death.
- "Wrongful death."

483
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:40,293
She'll have to go to the 
state pathologist at Claxton.

484
00:43:40,378 --> 00:43:42,671
Well, I better get back 
to that service.

485
00:43:42,755 --> 00:43:44,506
Lamar will help you.

486
00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:46,341
Lord Almighty.

487
00:43:50,805 --> 00:43:53,140
What else do you see, Starling?

488
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,393
Well, she's not local.

489
00:43:57,687 --> 00:44:00,814
Her ears are pierced three times,
and there's ...

490
00:44:02,066 --> 00:44:05,152
Glitter nail polish. 
It looks like town to me.

491
00:44:10,825 --> 00:44:12,534
Two of her fingernails 
are broken off,

492
00:44:12,618 --> 00:44:16,163
and there's dirt or grit under them.

493
00:44:16,831 --> 00:44:20,417
It looks like she's tried to claw 
her way through something.

494
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:23,336
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax them through Missing Persons.

495
00:44:23,379 --> 00:44:24,546
Right.

496
00:44:34,348 --> 00:44:36,016
Let's do another.

497
00:44:44,776 --> 00:44:47,235
She's got something in her throat.

498
00:44:47,779 --> 00:44:49,696
When a body comes out of the water,

499
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:52,866
lots of times there's, like,
leaves and things in the mouth.

500
00:45:24,065 --> 00:45:26,900
What is that, some kind of seedpod?

501
00:45:27,693 --> 00:45:30,111
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

502
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,615
There's no way that could get
way down in there like that.

503
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:36,409
Not unless somebody 
shoved it in there.

504
00:45:38,704 --> 00:45:41,248
She'll be easier to print
when we turn her over.

505
00:45:41,332 --> 00:45:44,626
- Lamar, will you give me a hand with this?
- Yes, sir, I will.

506
00:45:48,422 --> 00:45:51,967
Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?

507
00:45:52,426 --> 00:45:54,511
Different configuration
than the other victims.

508
00:45:54,595 --> 00:45:55,887
Get close-ups.

509
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:59,599
Victim's skin removed this time in 
two large diamond-shaped sections ...

510
00:45:59,642 --> 00:46:00,892
above the buttocks.

511
00:46:00,935 --> 00:46:04,354
Stellate exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae ...

512
00:46:04,689 --> 00:46:07,148
approximately six inches
from the right shoulder blade.

513
00:46:07,233 --> 00:46:08,525
Starling?

514
00:46:09,902 --> 00:46:13,530
When I told that sheriff we 
shouldn't talk in front of a woman,

515
00:46:13,614 --> 00:46:15,448
that really burned you, didn't it?

516
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:18,952
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

517
00:46:19,161 --> 00:46:20,954
It matters, Mr. Crawford.

518
00:46:20,997 --> 00:46:23,540
Cops look at you to see how to act.

519
00:46:23,624 --> 00:46:25,834
- It matters.
- Point taken.

520
00:46:32,466 --> 00:46:34,801
Ligature marks found 
around the wrists,

521
00:46:34,969 --> 00:46:36,636
not around the ankles.

522
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:40,056
This would indicate that 
the skinning was post-mortem.

523
00:47:03,414 --> 00:47:06,499
- Time, Pilch. My move.
- No fair. You lured him with produce.

524
00:47:06,542 --> 00:47:08,793
Tough noogies. Still my turn.

525
00:47:10,046 --> 00:47:11,838
Nice and slow, baby.

526
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:16,343
If the beetle moves one of 
your men, does that still count?

527
00:47:17,261 --> 00:47:19,346
Of course it counts. 
How do you play?

528
00:47:20,681 --> 00:47:22,223
Agent Starling?

529
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:27,520
Where the heck did this come from?
It's practically mush.

530
00:47:27,605 --> 00:47:29,856
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim.

531
00:47:29,941 --> 00:47:32,192
The body was in the Elk River,
West Virginia.

532
00:47:32,276 --> 00:47:33,652
It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

533
00:47:33,694 --> 00:47:35,487
I'm afraid I can't tell you
any more about that.

534
00:47:35,529 --> 00:47:36,821
We heard about it on the radio.

535
00:47:36,864 --> 00:47:40,200
You mean this is like a clue
from a real murder case? Cool!

536
00:47:40,284 --> 00:47:42,702
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

537
00:47:43,204 --> 00:47:46,206
A Sphingid. Ceratomia, maybe.

538
00:47:46,248 --> 00:47:48,166
Boy, he's a big sucker.

539
00:47:49,543 --> 00:47:50,877
Okay.

540
00:47:51,045 --> 00:47:52,921
Let's check morphology.

541
00:48:01,514 --> 00:48:04,432
What do you do when you're not 
detecting, Agent Starling?

542
00:48:06,018 --> 00:48:08,520
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

543
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,398
You ever go out
for cheeseburgers and beer?

544
00:48:12,525 --> 00:48:14,442
The amusing house wine?

545
00:48:14,902 --> 00:48:18,113
- Are you hitting on me, Doctor?
- Yes.

546
00:48:18,698 --> 00:48:20,573
- Got you.
- What do you got, Roden?

547
00:48:20,658 --> 00:48:24,911
Agent Starling, 
meet Mr. Acherontia Styx.

548
00:48:25,788 --> 00:48:26,997
Weird.

549
00:48:27,081 --> 00:48:30,417
Better known to his friends
as the Death's Head Moth.

550
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:33,211
- And where does it come from?
- That's what's strange.

551
00:48:33,254 --> 00:48:34,963
- They only live in Asia.
- Asia?

552
00:48:35,047 --> 00:48:37,924
In this country, they'd have to be
specially raised from imported eggs.

553
00:48:38,009 --> 00:48:41,553
Somebody grew this guy,
fed him honey and nightshade,

554
00:48:41,595 --> 00:48:43,138
kept him warm.

555
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:45,640
Somebody loved him.

556
00:49:19,884 --> 00:49:21,384
Where are you?

557
00:49:22,762 --> 00:49:24,679
Let me out of here!

558
00:49:33,898 --> 00:49:35,815
Please don't leave!

559
00:49:38,402 --> 00:49:40,487
Talk to me, please!

560
00:49:41,113 --> 00:49:43,990
Why won't you answer me? Please!

561
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,536
Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucchi.

562
00:49:48,621 --> 00:49:50,163
I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

563
00:49:50,206 --> 00:49:53,500
And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.

564
00:49:53,584 --> 00:49:54,918
Catherine Martin,

565
00:49:55,002 --> 00:49:57,670
the 25-year-old daughter
of Senator Ruth Martin,

566
00:49:57,755 --> 00:50:01,216
listed first as a missing person, is 
now believed to have been kidnapped ...

567
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,052
by the serial killer
known only as Buffalo Bill.

568
00:50:04,136 --> 00:50:06,721
Memphis police sources indicate
that the missing girl's blouse ...

569
00:50:06,806 --> 00:50:08,807
has been identified, 
sliced up the back ...

570
00:50:08,849 --> 00:50:12,519
in what has become a kind of grim,
all-too-familiar calling card.

571
00:50:12,561 --> 00:50:14,187
Young Catherine Martin, 
as we've said,

572
00:50:14,271 --> 00:50:16,523
is the only daughter of
U.S. Senator Ruth Martin,

573
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:18,858
the Republican junior senator
from Tennessee.

574
00:50:18,943 --> 00:50:20,819
And while her kidnapping is not,
at this point,

575
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:22,529
considered to be 
politically motivated,

576
00:50:22,613 --> 00:50:25,698
nevertheless, it has stirred the 
government to its highest levels.

577
00:50:25,783 --> 00:50:28,701
Reached for a comment on the 
ski slopes of Stowe, Vermont,

578
00:50:28,786 --> 00:50:32,747
the president himself said to be,
and I quote, "Intensely concerned."

579
00:50:32,832 --> 00:50:34,332
Just moments ago, Senator Martin ...

580
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:37,377
taped this dramatic personal plea.
- Excuse me.

581
00:50:37,419 --> 00:50:41,089
I'm speaking now to the person 
who is holding my daughter.

582
00:50:42,383 --> 00:50:45,176
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

583
00:50:46,387 --> 00:50:48,555
Talk to her, and you'll see.

584
00:50:49,932 --> 00:50:53,184
You have the power. 
You are in charge.

585
00:50:56,438 --> 00:50:59,566
I know you can feel love 
and compassion.

586
00:51:01,152 --> 00:51:04,571
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world ...

587
00:51:05,197 --> 00:51:08,116
that you can be merciful 
as well as strong,

588
00:51:08,742 --> 00:51:13,621
that you're big enough to treat Catherine
better than the world has treated you.

589
00:51:14,165 --> 00:51:15,915
You have that power.

590
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:17,667
Please.

591
00:51:18,586 --> 00:51:20,670
My daughter is Catherine.

592
00:51:20,754 --> 00:51:22,839
- Boy, that's smart.
- Release her unharmed.

593
00:51:22,923 --> 00:51:24,382
Jesus, that's really smart.

594
00:51:24,425 --> 00:51:26,676
She keeps repeating the name.

595
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,180
If he sees Catherine as a person
and not just an object,

596
00:51:30,264 --> 00:51:34,642
it's harder to tear her up.
- Please. Release my little girl.

597
00:51:35,853 --> 00:51:37,228
What you're doing, Miss Starling,

598
00:51:37,271 --> 00:51:39,480
is coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview

599
00:51:39,565 --> 00:51:43,443
and refusing to share information 
with me for the third time.

600
00:51:43,485 --> 00:51:45,778
Sir, I told you,

601
00:51:45,821 --> 00:51:47,989
this is just a routine follow-up
on the Raspail case.

602
00:51:48,073 --> 00:51:51,409
- He is my patient. I have rights.
- I understand that, sir.

603
00:51:51,452 --> 00:51:55,622
Look, I am not just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.

604
00:51:56,999 --> 00:51:59,417
This is the number for
the U.S. Attorney's office.

605
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,753
Please, either you discuss 
this with him,

606
00:52:01,795 --> 00:52:04,547
or you let me do my job.
Do you understand?

607
00:52:09,178 --> 00:52:12,096
If your profile helps us 
catch Buffalo Bill ...

608
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,058
in time to save Catherine Martin,

609
00:52:15,851 --> 00:52:18,394
the senator promises you a transfer ...

610
00:52:18,479 --> 00:52:21,397
to the V.A. Hospital
at Oneida Park, New York,

611
00:52:21,482 --> 00:52:22,815
with a view of the woods nearby.

612
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,652
Maximum security 
still applies, of course.

613
00:52:25,819 --> 00:52:28,488
You'd have reasonable 
access to books.

614
00:52:29,323 --> 00:52:31,115
Best of all, though.

615
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:33,243
One week of the year,

616
00:52:33,327 --> 00:52:37,372
you get to leave 
the hospital and go here.

617
00:52:40,793 --> 00:52:42,335
Plum Island.

618
00:52:43,629 --> 00:52:46,923
Every day of that week
you may walk on the beach,

619
00:52:47,007 --> 00:52:49,592
you may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour,

620
00:52:49,677 --> 00:52:52,929
under SWAT team surveillance, 
of course.

621
00:52:53,681 --> 00:52:55,556
And there you have it.

622
00:52:58,185 --> 00:53:01,854
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

623
00:53:03,399 --> 00:53:05,692
A copy of the senator's offer.

624
00:53:06,026 --> 00:53:09,279
This offer is 
non-negotiable and final.

625
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:12,865
If Catherine Martin dies, 
you get nothing.

626
00:53:22,918 --> 00:53:26,045
"Plum Island
Animal Disease Research Center."

627
00:53:29,216 --> 00:53:30,842
Sounds charming.

628
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:35,388
That's only part of the island.
There's a very, very nice beach.

629
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:38,641
- Terns nest there. There's beautiful ...
- Terns?

630
00:53:41,061 --> 00:53:44,188
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be "turns" with us, too.

631
00:53:44,231 --> 00:53:47,400
Quid pro quo. I tell you things, 
you tell me things.

632
00:53:47,443 --> 00:53:50,403
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.

633
00:53:50,446 --> 00:53:53,114
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

634
00:53:55,826 --> 00:53:59,245
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.

635
00:54:00,622 --> 00:54:02,081
Go, Doctor.

636
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:05,877
What is your worst 
memory of childhood?

637
00:54:07,755 --> 00:54:09,672
The death of my father.

638
00:54:10,341 --> 00:54:13,426
Tell me about it. 
And don't lie, or I'll know.

639
00:54:14,428 --> 00:54:16,429
He was a town marshal,

640
00:54:17,765 --> 00:54:21,225
and one night 
he surprised two burglars ...

641
00:54:21,268 --> 00:54:23,936
coming out of the back 
of a drugstore.

642
00:54:24,938 --> 00:54:26,439
They shot him.

643
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,900
Was he killed outright?

644
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,279
No. He was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

645
00:54:34,615 --> 00:54:37,241
My mother died when I was very young,

646
00:54:39,036 --> 00:54:41,287
so my father had become
the whole world to me,

647
00:54:41,372 --> 00:54:44,957
and when he left me, I had nothing.
I was ten years old.

648
00:54:46,627 --> 00:54:48,795
You're very frank, Clarice.

649
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:53,633
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

650
00:54:56,303 --> 00:54:58,137
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

651
00:54:59,139 --> 00:55:01,432
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.

652
00:55:01,475 --> 00:55:03,476
Was she a large girl?

653
00:55:06,313 --> 00:55:07,438
Yes.

654
00:55:07,481 --> 00:55:11,192
- Big through the hips? Roomy?
- They all were.

655
00:55:12,027 --> 00:55:13,361
What else?

656
00:55:13,445 --> 00:55:17,240
She had an object deliberately 
inserted into her throat.

657
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:20,159
Now, that hasn't 
been made public yet.

658
00:55:20,244 --> 00:55:22,161
We don't know what it means.

659
00:55:22,246 --> 00:55:23,996
Was it a butterfly?

660
00:55:25,332 --> 00:55:27,333
Yes. A moth.

661
00:55:28,502 --> 00:55:32,630
Just like the one we found in 
Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

662
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:36,759
Why does he place 
them there, Doctor?

663
00:55:37,177 --> 00:55:40,388
The significance 
of the moth is change.

664
00:55:41,223 --> 00:55:44,058
Caterpillar into chrysalis or pupa,

665
00:55:44,852 --> 00:55:47,019
and from thence into beauty.

666
00:55:47,896 --> 00:55:50,231
Our Billy wants to change, too.

667
00:55:51,525 --> 00:55:54,902
There's no correlation in literature
between transsexualism and violence.

668
00:55:54,987 --> 00:55:58,072
- Transsexuals are very passive ...
- Clever girl.

669
00:55:58,323 --> 00:56:00,199
You're so close
to the way you're gonna catch him.

670
00:56:00,284 --> 00:56:03,161
- Do you realize that?
- No. Tell me why.

671
00:56:04,663 --> 00:56:06,831
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

672
00:56:06,874 --> 00:56:08,666
What happened next?

673
00:56:12,171 --> 00:56:16,257
I don't imagine the answer is on 
those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

674
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:20,720
I went to live with my mother's 
cousin and her husband in Montana.

675
00:56:20,804 --> 00:56:22,472
They had a ranch.

676
00:56:22,764 --> 00:56:25,600
- Was it a cattle ranch?
- Sheep and horses.

677
00:56:26,643 --> 00:56:30,021
- How long did you live there?
- Two months.

678
00:56:30,606 --> 00:56:33,274
- Why so briefly?
- I ran away.

679
00:56:33,901 --> 00:56:35,401
Why, Clarice?

680
00:56:35,611 --> 00:56:37,987
Did the rancher 
make you perform fellatio?

681
00:56:38,071 --> 00:56:40,072
Did he sodomize you?

682
00:56:40,574 --> 00:56:43,493
No. He was a very decent man.

683
00:56:45,496 --> 00:56:47,330
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

684
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:51,709
Billy is not a real transsexual.

685
00:56:51,919 --> 00:56:54,086
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

686
00:56:54,129 --> 00:56:57,048
He's tried to be 
a lot of things, I expect.

687
00:56:57,424 --> 00:56:59,884
And you said that I was very close
to the way we would catch him.

688
00:56:59,927 --> 00:57:01,344
What did you mean, Doctor?

689
00:57:01,428 --> 00:57:03,971
There are three major centers
for transsexual surgery.

690
00:57:04,056 --> 00:57:08,267
Johns Hopkins, the University of
Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.

691
00:57:08,435 --> 00:57:11,812
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy 
had applied for sex reassignment ...

692
00:57:11,897 --> 00:57:14,815
at one or all of them 
and been rejected.

693
00:57:16,026 --> 00:57:17,860
On what basis would they reject him?

694
00:57:18,779 --> 00:57:23,032
Look for severe childhood distur-
bances associated with violence.

695
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:26,327
Our Billy wasn't born 
a criminal, Clarice.

696
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:30,164
He was made one
through years of systematic abuse.

697
00:57:30,832 --> 00:57:34,460
Billy hates his own identity, 
you see,

698
00:57:34,503 --> 00:57:37,296
and he thinks that makes him
a transsexual.

699
00:57:37,381 --> 00:57:41,384
But his pathology is a 
thousand times more savage ...

700
00:57:41,468 --> 00:57:43,261
and more terrifying.

701
00:57:47,015 --> 00:57:50,977
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

702
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:53,646
Mister, my family will pay cash.

703
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:56,983
Whatever ransom you're asking for,
they'll pay it.

704
00:57:57,526 --> 00:58:01,988
It rubs the lotion on its skin,
or else it gets the hose again.

705
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:06,993
Yes, she will, Precious.
She will get the hose.

706
00:58:07,786 --> 00:58:09,912
Okay, okay, okay.

707
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:13,332
Okay. I'm there.

708
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:14,875
Okay.

709
00:58:16,128 --> 00:58:20,047
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges.

710
00:58:20,132 --> 00:58:21,507
I promise.

711
00:58:22,509 --> 00:58:27,096
See, my mom is a real important woman.
I guess you already know that.

712
00:58:27,431 --> 00:58:30,141
Now it places 
the lotion in the basket.

713
00:58:30,809 --> 00:58:34,687
Please! Please! I want to go home.

714
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:39,025
I want to go home, please!
Please, I want to ...

715
00:58:39,067 --> 00:58:41,611
It places the lotion in the basket.

716
00:58:42,279 --> 00:58:46,240
I want to see my mommy! Please.

717
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:49,910
I want to see my mother again.

718
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,205
I want to see my mommy.

719
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:56,917
Put the fucking 
lotion in the basket!

720
00:59:32,746 --> 00:59:36,040
You still think you're gonna walk 
on some beach and see the birdies?

721
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:38,000
No, I don't think so.

722
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:42,254
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

723
00:59:42,339 --> 00:59:44,965
She never heard of any deal with you.

724
00:59:45,634 --> 00:59:47,760
They scammed you, Hannibal.

725
00:59:49,846 --> 00:59:51,347
Stand outside ...

726
00:59:52,641 --> 00:59:54,350
and shut the door.

727
00:59:54,601 --> 00:59:55,810
Barney.

728
01:00:01,983 --> 01:00:06,112
There never was a deal with 
Senator Martin, but there is now.

729
01:00:06,488 --> 01:00:07,905
I designed it.

730
01:00:07,948 --> 01:00:11,575
Of course, I worked in a few conditions
for my own benefit as well.

731
01:00:11,868 --> 01:00:14,954
Identify Buffalo Bill by name ...

732
01:00:15,163 --> 01:00:17,289
and if the girl is found in time,

733
01:00:17,332 --> 01:00:19,083
Senator Martin will have you
transferred to ...

734
01:00:19,126 --> 01:00:21,293
Brushy Mountain State Prison
in Tennessee.

735
01:00:22,754 --> 01:00:24,547
Answer me, Hannibal.

736
01:00:26,591 --> 01:00:30,720
You answer me now, or by God, 
you'll never leave this cell.

737
01:00:33,181 --> 01:00:34,974
Who is Buffalo Bill?

738
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:38,310
His first name is Louis.

739
01:00:38,979 --> 01:00:42,481
I'll tell the rest to the Senator 
herself, but only in Tennessee,

740
01:00:42,524 --> 01:00:45,192
and I have a few 
conditions of my own.

741
01:00:47,821 --> 01:00:50,114
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

742
01:00:50,991 --> 01:00:54,118
Jack, Hannibal Lecter
is being transferred to Memphis.

743
01:00:54,411 --> 01:00:55,786
Transferred?

744
01:00:55,829 --> 01:00:58,956
Did you have a trainee make some 
sort of phony offer to Lecter ...

745
01:00:58,999 --> 01:01:00,332
in the Senator's name?

746
01:01:00,584 --> 01:01:02,460
Yeah. I rolled the dice. I had to.

747
01:01:02,586 --> 01:01:04,837
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.

748
01:01:04,921 --> 01:01:06,922
Paul Krendler's over 
here from Justice.

749
01:01:07,007 --> 01:01:09,675
She's asking him to 
take over in Memphis.

750
01:01:34,493 --> 01:01:36,243
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

751
01:01:36,328 --> 01:01:39,121
I'm Lieutenant Boyle.
This is Sergeant Patrick.

752
01:01:39,206 --> 01:01:41,373
Now, we're gonna treat you
as good as you treat us.

753
01:01:41,416 --> 01:01:44,919
You be a gentleman,
you gonna get three hots and a cot.

754
01:01:45,712 --> 01:01:49,173
Sir. If you sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

755
01:01:52,219 --> 01:01:53,677
Where is it?

756
01:01:54,888 --> 01:01:56,722
Here, sir. Use mine.

757
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:47,606
Senator Martin, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

758
01:02:52,946 --> 01:02:54,321
Dr. Lecter,

759
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:58,325
I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

760
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:01,287
You'll want to read it before I sign.

761
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:09,295
I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time bargaining for petty privileges.

762
01:03:09,337 --> 01:03:11,463
Clarice Starling and that 
awful Jack Crawford ...

763
01:03:11,506 --> 01:03:13,632
have wasted far 
too much time already.

764
01:03:13,717 --> 01:03:16,760
I only pray they haven't doomed
the poor girl.

765
01:03:17,846 --> 01:03:21,473
Let me help you now and I will 
trust you when it is all over.

766
01:03:21,558 --> 01:03:23,475
You have my word. Paul?

767
01:03:25,979 --> 01:03:28,814
Buffalo Bill's real name 
is Louis Friend.

768
01:03:30,108 --> 01:03:31,150
I met him just once.

769
01:03:31,234 --> 01:03:34,320
He was referred to me in April
or May, 1980,

770
01:03:34,362 --> 01:03:36,697
by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

771
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,325
They were lovers, you see.

772
01:03:39,492 --> 01:03:42,912
But Raspail had 
become very frightened.

773
01:03:43,705 --> 01:03:46,916
Apparently, Louis had murdered
a transient ...

774
01:03:47,334 --> 01:03:50,461
and done things with her skin.

775
01:03:51,504 --> 01:03:54,590
We need his address
and a physical description.

776
01:03:55,592 --> 01:03:57,259
Tell me, Senator.

777
01:03:57,886 --> 01:04:00,346
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?

778
01:04:00,764 --> 01:04:03,098
- What?
- Did you breast-feed her?

779
01:04:03,183 --> 01:04:05,809
- Now, wait a minute!
- Yes, I did.

780
01:04:06,227 --> 01:04:09,855
- Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
- You son of a bitch!

781
01:04:10,106 --> 01:04:13,692
Amputate a man's leg,
and he can still feel it tickling.

782
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:17,571
Tell me, Mom, when your 
little girl is on the slab,

783
01:04:17,656 --> 01:04:19,657
where will it tickle you?

784
01:04:19,699 --> 01:04:22,701
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

785
01:04:24,204 --> 01:04:27,331
Five-foot-ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.

786
01:04:27,457 --> 01:04:29,708
Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.

787
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:31,502
He'd be about 35 now.

788
01:04:31,544 --> 01:04:34,630
He said he lived in Philadelphia,
but may have lied.

789
01:04:34,714 --> 01:04:36,715
That's all I can remember, Mom.

790
01:04:36,758 --> 01:04:39,885
But if I think of any more,
I will let you know.

791
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:44,390
Oh, and, Senator, 
just one more thing.

792
01:04:46,726 --> 01:04:48,268
Love your suit.

793
01:04:50,522 --> 01:04:52,731
I tell you now that in a 
meeting earlier this evening ...

794
01:04:52,774 --> 01:04:54,066
with Senator Ruth Martin,

795
01:04:54,109 --> 01:04:57,152
Dr. Lecter agreed
to assist in the investigation ...

796
01:04:57,237 --> 01:05:00,072
of trying to find the abductor
of Catherine Martin, Buffalo Bill.

797
01:05:00,115 --> 01:05:01,156
How do you fit in, sir?

798
01:05:01,241 --> 01:05:02,741
Well, it's only through
my own unique insight ...

799
01:05:02,826 --> 01:05:04,868
into Lecter's mind that this 
breakthrough was possible.

800
01:05:04,911 --> 01:05:06,036
And Buffalo Bill's real name ...

801
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,999
Buffalo Bill's real name is now a matter
of record with the proper authorities.

802
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:12,668
- Can you give us any more information?
- My name is Dr. Frederick Chilton.

803
01:05:12,752 --> 01:05:14,253
- How do you spell that?
- C-H ...

804
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:20,426
- Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?
- Oh, well, I just saw him outside, sir.

805
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,221
Access to Lecter is strictly limited.
We've been getting death threats.

806
01:05:24,264 --> 01:05:25,973
I understand, sir.

807
01:05:32,063 --> 01:05:34,106
Log in. Check your weapon.

808
01:05:34,941 --> 01:05:37,359
Well, I can't take all 
the credit for myself.

809
01:05:37,444 --> 01:05:39,987
Senator Martin, the Justice 
Department, the people at the FBI,

810
01:05:40,071 --> 01:05:42,281
the folks at the 
Baltimore State Hospital.

811
01:05:42,323 --> 01:05:45,659
And now for the hard part,
apprehending the suspect.

812
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:48,370
Excuse me, folks,
I'm gonna have to catch a flight.

813
01:05:52,292 --> 01:05:54,501
Command desk. Officer Jacobs.

814
01:06:03,136 --> 01:06:05,262
Is it true what they're saying?

815
01:06:07,307 --> 01:06:09,391
He's some kind of vampire?

816
01:06:11,728 --> 01:06:14,396
They don't have a name 
for what he is.

817
01:06:15,065 --> 01:06:16,940
You do know the rules, ma'am?

818
01:06:17,442 --> 01:06:20,027
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.

819
01:06:23,364 --> 01:06:24,656
Go ahead.

820
01:07:01,569 --> 01:07:03,487
Good evening, Clarice.

821
01:07:05,156 --> 01:07:08,492
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

822
01:07:10,578 --> 01:07:12,830
Just until you get your view.

823
01:07:13,331 --> 01:07:15,124
How very thoughtful.

824
01:07:16,543 --> 01:07:19,628
Or did Jack Crawford send you
for one last wheedle ...

825
01:07:19,712 --> 01:07:21,922
before you're both 
booted off the case?

826
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:24,675
No. I came because I wanted to.

827
01:07:29,222 --> 01:07:31,515
People will say we're in love.

828
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:37,855
Anthrax Island.

829
01:07:38,523 --> 01:07:41,441
That was an especially 
nice touch, Clarice.

830
01:07:41,693 --> 01:07:43,944
- Yours?
- Yes.

831
01:07:44,863 --> 01:07:47,990
Yeah! That was good.

832
01:07:48,908 --> 01:07:50,909
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

833
01:07:53,454 --> 01:07:55,914
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

834
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:58,333
Louis Friend?

835
01:07:59,085 --> 01:08:02,045
Iron sulfide, 
also known as Fool's Gold.

836
01:08:02,672 --> 01:08:06,758
Oh, Clarice. Your problem is you 
need to get more fun out of life.

837
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:10,012
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.

838
01:08:10,096 --> 01:08:11,889
Please continue now.

839
01:08:12,182 --> 01:08:15,100
Well, I have read 
the case files, have you?

840
01:08:15,143 --> 01:08:18,312
Everything you need to find him
is right there in those pages.

841
01:08:18,396 --> 01:08:22,816
- Then tell me how.
- First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.

842
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:24,860
Read Marcus Aurelius.

843
01:08:24,944 --> 01:08:28,238
Of each particular thing,
ask what is it in itself?

844
01:08:28,448 --> 01:08:30,240
What is its nature?

845
01:08:30,658 --> 01:08:33,952
What does he do, this man you seek?

846
01:08:36,122 --> 01:08:37,664
He kills women.

847
01:08:37,749 --> 01:08:40,292
No! That is incidental.

848
01:08:41,461 --> 01:08:43,295
What is the first
and principal thing he does?

849
01:08:43,338 --> 01:08:46,632
What needs does he serve by killing?

850
01:08:47,133 --> 01:08:48,342
Anger.

851
01:08:50,053 --> 01:08:54,431
Social acceptance
and sexual frustrations ...

852
01:08:54,474 --> 01:08:57,434
No! He covets.

853
01:08:58,728 --> 01:09:00,479
That is his nature.

854
01:09:00,813 --> 01:09:03,482
And how do we begin 
to covet, Clarice?

855
01:09:03,983 --> 01:09:06,318
Do we seek out things to covet?

856
01:09:07,153 --> 01:09:09,196
Make an effort to answer now.

857
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,531
No. We just ...

858
01:09:11,991 --> 01:09:15,077
No. We begin by coveting
what we see every day.

859
01:09:15,411 --> 01:09:18,705
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

860
01:09:19,582 --> 01:09:22,793
And don't your eyes
seek out the things you want?

861
01:09:23,503 --> 01:09:25,963
All right. Yes. 
Now please tell me how.

862
01:09:26,339 --> 01:09:30,175
No. It is your turn 
to tell me, Clarice.

863
01:09:30,426 --> 01:09:33,303
You don't have any 
more vacations to sell.

864
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,889
Why did you leave that ranch?

865
01:09:36,432 --> 01:09:40,143
Doctor, we don't have any more 
time for any of this now.

866
01:09:40,645 --> 01:09:43,313
But we don't reckon time the 
same way, do we, Clarice?

867
01:09:43,356 --> 01:09:45,315
This is all the time 
you'll ever have.

868
01:09:45,358 --> 01:09:47,859
Later. Now, please, listen to me.
We've only got five ...

869
01:09:47,902 --> 01:09:50,487
No! I will listen now.

870
01:09:53,491 --> 01:09:55,367
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

871
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:56,660
You were ten years old.

872
01:09:56,703 --> 01:10:00,539
You went to live with cousins on 
a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

873
01:10:00,581 --> 01:10:01,707
And?

874
01:10:03,835 --> 01:10:06,003
And one morning, I just ran away.

875
01:10:06,713 --> 01:10:09,756
Not "just", Clarice. 
What set you off?

876
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:13,969
- You started at what time?
- Early. Still dark.

877
01:10:14,345 --> 01:10:18,348
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream? What was it?

878
01:10:19,726 --> 01:10:21,727
I heard a strange noise.

879
01:10:22,645 --> 01:10:24,062
What was it?

880
01:10:24,647 --> 01:10:28,150
It was screaming.

881
01:10:30,069 --> 01:10:33,071
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.

882
01:10:33,448 --> 01:10:35,073
What did you do?

883
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:38,994
I went downstairs, outside.

884
01:10:41,831 --> 01:10:43,874
I crept up into the barn.

885
01:10:44,584 --> 01:10:47,627
I was so scared to look 
inside, but I had to.

886
01:10:48,838 --> 01:10:51,965
And what did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?

887
01:10:53,718 --> 01:10:57,262
Lambs. They were screaming.

888
01:10:58,431 --> 01:11:01,183
They were slaughtering 
the spring lambs?

889
01:11:01,601 --> 01:11:03,602
And they were screaming.

890
01:11:04,812 --> 01:11:07,314
- And you ran away?
- No.

891
01:11:08,524 --> 01:11:10,650
First I tried to free them.

892
01:11:11,194 --> 01:11:13,653
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

893
01:11:13,738 --> 01:11:17,032
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

894
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:20,118
But you could and you did, 
didn't you?

895
01:11:20,787 --> 01:11:24,289
Yes. I took one lamb,
and I ran away as fast as I could.

896
01:11:24,374 --> 01:11:26,958
- Where were you going, Clarice?
- I don't know.

897
01:11:27,043 --> 01:11:31,755
I didn't have any food, any water,
and it was very cold, very cold.

898
01:11:34,425 --> 01:11:38,470
I thought if I could 
save just one, but,

899
01:11:41,057 --> 01:11:42,682
he was so heavy.

900
01:11:43,684 --> 01:11:45,310
He was so heavy.

901
01:11:50,566 --> 01:11:54,945
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

902
01:11:57,657 --> 01:11:58,990
The rancher was so angry,

903
01:11:59,033 --> 01:12:02,536
he sent me to live at the 
Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

904
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,830
I never saw the ranch again.

905
01:12:05,415 --> 01:12:07,874
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

906
01:12:10,086 --> 01:12:11,711
They killed him.

907
01:12:11,796 --> 01:12:14,172
You still wake up 
sometimes, don't you?

908
01:12:14,257 --> 01:12:18,844
Wake up in the dark and hear 
the screaming of the lambs.

909
01:12:19,887 --> 01:12:21,012
Yes.

910
01:12:22,723 --> 01:12:27,018
And you think if you save poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?

911
01:12:27,103 --> 01:12:29,479
You think if Catherine lives,

912
01:12:29,522 --> 01:12:32,315
you won't wake up 
in the dark ever again

913
01:12:32,817 --> 01:12:35,444
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

914
01:12:36,821 --> 01:12:39,781
I don't know. I don't know.

915
01:12:41,993 --> 01:12:45,620
Thank you, Clarice. Thank you.

916
01:12:46,497 --> 01:12:48,540
Tell me his name, Doctor.

917
01:12:55,465 --> 01:12:57,382
Dr. Chilton, I presume.

918
01:12:58,259 --> 01:13:00,427
I think you know each other.

919
01:13:02,054 --> 01:13:03,388
Okay.

920
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:06,391
- We found her.
- Let's go!

921
01:13:06,642 --> 01:13:08,560
It's your turn, Doctor.

922
01:13:08,811 --> 01:13:10,812
- Out.
- Tell me his name.

923
01:13:10,897 --> 01:13:13,565
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders.
I have to put you on a plane.

924
01:13:13,649 --> 01:13:15,066
Come on now.

925
01:13:15,109 --> 01:13:16,651
Brave Clarice.

926
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:21,114
You will let me know when those 
lambs stop screaming, won't you?

927
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,200
Tell me his name, Doctor!

928
01:13:23,242 --> 01:13:24,534
Clarice!

929
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:27,412
Your case file.

930
01:13:32,627 --> 01:13:34,336
Goodbye, Clarice.

931
01:14:40,152 --> 01:14:42,153
Ready when you are, Doc.

932
01:14:42,321 --> 01:14:44,489
Just another minute, please.

933
01:14:53,457 --> 01:14:55,875
The son of a bitch
demanded a second dinner.

934
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,003
Lamb chops, extra rare.

935
01:14:58,045 --> 01:15:00,005
Wonder what he wants for breakfast.

936
01:15:00,047 --> 01:15:02,340
Some damn thing from the zoo?

937
01:15:24,155 --> 01:15:25,947
Good evening, gentlemen.

938
01:15:26,032 --> 01:15:29,534
- Okay, Doc. Grab some floor.
- Same drill as before, please.

939
01:15:37,126 --> 01:15:39,669
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

940
01:15:55,895 --> 01:15:57,020
Okay.

941
01:16:03,903 --> 01:16:05,904
Hand me that, would you?

942
01:16:11,077 --> 01:16:12,285
Thanks.

943
01:16:16,123 --> 01:16:18,208
Mind the drawings, please.

944
01:16:21,253 --> 01:16:22,587
Thank you.

945
01:16:46,987 --> 01:16:49,280
- Jimmy, watch it! He's got me!
- Jesus, Bill!

946
01:16:56,288 --> 01:16:57,789
Jesus Christ!

947
01:18:16,368 --> 01:18:18,953
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

948
01:18:28,214 --> 01:18:29,881
What is this shit?

949
01:18:32,676 --> 01:18:36,387
- Did somebody go up on five?
- No. Nobody went up.

950
01:18:36,722 --> 01:18:38,640
Call Pembry. Ask him ...

951
01:18:41,268 --> 01:18:44,020
CP, shots fired on five. Repeat.

952
01:18:44,396 --> 01:18:46,940
- Shots fired on five.
- Sergeant Tate.

953
01:18:49,693 --> 01:18:51,027
Holy shit.

954
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:52,904
What the hell? Bitch!

955
01:18:53,447 --> 01:18:54,697
Shut up.

956
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:57,534
- Bobby, get the vest.
- Right, Sarge.

957
01:18:58,202 --> 01:19:00,078
- Brady, Howard ...
- Look!

958
01:19:03,249 --> 01:19:04,624
It stopped.

959
01:19:06,126 --> 01:19:07,836
Seal off a 10 block radius.

960
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,755
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance double-quick.

961
01:19:10,798 --> 01:19:12,006
We're going up.

962
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,745
Pembry!

963
01:19:44,248 --> 01:19:45,957
Boyle!

964
01:19:58,637 --> 01:19:59,846
Oh, God!

965
01:20:07,146 --> 01:20:08,146
Go.

966
01:20:15,988 --> 01:20:17,447
- Clear!
- Clear!

967
01:20:17,489 --> 01:20:20,491
Command post, two officers down.

968
01:20:20,868 --> 01:20:22,201
- Clear!
- Clear!

969
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,495
Lecter's gone, Sarge.

970
01:20:24,538 --> 01:20:26,372
The prisoner is missing.

971
01:20:26,457 --> 01:20:28,374
Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.

972
01:20:28,459 --> 01:20:31,002
Repeat. Lecter is missing and armed.

973
01:20:31,128 --> 01:20:34,172
He stripped the bed.
Might be making a rope.

974
01:20:34,256 --> 01:20:35,924
Check all windows.

975
01:20:36,008 --> 01:20:38,343
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

976
01:20:39,011 --> 01:20:40,428
He's alive.

977
01:20:41,138 --> 01:20:43,181
Sergeant Tate, he's alive!

978
01:20:43,724 --> 01:20:46,851
Get a hold of him where you can
feel his hands, son. Talk to him.

979
01:20:47,353 --> 01:20:48,603
What do I say?

980
01:20:48,687 --> 01:20:51,481
It's Jim Pembry! 
Now talk to him, damn it!

981
01:20:52,483 --> 01:20:54,609
Lecter is missing and armed.

982
01:20:54,777 --> 01:20:57,028
Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me?

983
01:20:57,112 --> 01:21:00,114
He took Boyle's gun.
Pembry got off one round.

984
01:21:00,199 --> 01:21:02,200
There's a chance Lecter was hit.

985
01:21:02,284 --> 01:21:04,369
Keep breathing in and out. 
That's it.

986
01:21:04,453 --> 01:21:07,705
You're doing a good job.
You look real good there.

987
01:21:08,457 --> 01:21:11,334
Yeah, you look ... 
You look real good.

988
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,686
- You ready?
- Let's go.

989
01:21:29,728 --> 01:21:31,646
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

990
01:21:42,741 --> 01:21:44,909
Looking good, Pembry.
You're gonna make it.

991
01:21:44,994 --> 01:21:47,078
You're just fine. You're doing 
all right. That's right.

992
01:21:47,162 --> 01:21:49,580
- Okay, I need that IV now.
- Lactated ringers.

993
01:21:49,665 --> 01:21:50,915
Can we get the strap?

994
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,041
Where's the fucking oxygen?

995
01:21:52,084 --> 01:21:53,835
- Looking good, buddy. That's right.
- Bob!

996
01:21:53,919 --> 01:21:55,753
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

997
01:21:57,423 --> 01:21:59,632
We're losing him. Downstairs. 
Take him!

998
01:22:00,426 --> 01:22:01,634
And up!

999
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:04,345
- Elevator!
- Out of the way!

1000
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:05,930
Out of the way!

1001
01:22:10,769 --> 01:22:12,103
CP to Tate.

1002
01:22:12,813 --> 01:22:15,023
Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

1003
01:22:15,733 --> 01:22:18,568
I'm on the elevator 
bringing Pembry down.

1004
01:22:18,819 --> 01:22:20,862
He seems to be hanging on.

1005
01:22:21,488 --> 01:22:23,489
Top three floors secured.

1006
01:22:24,116 --> 01:22:26,034
Main stairwell secured.

1007
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:28,911
We think he's on two.

1008
01:22:42,217 --> 01:22:44,343
Tate, are you still with me?

1009
01:22:46,305 --> 01:22:48,723
We're pretty sure
he's somewhere on two, sir.

1010
01:22:48,807 --> 01:22:50,808
That's all for now. Over.

1011
01:23:10,245 --> 01:23:12,663
He's on the roof of the elevator.

1012
01:23:15,459 --> 01:23:16,834
Okay, guys.

1013
01:23:33,435 --> 01:23:34,769
I see him.

1014
01:23:34,937 --> 01:23:37,814
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

1015
01:23:38,107 --> 01:23:39,982
One warning. We need him alive.

1016
01:23:40,025 --> 01:23:41,359
Got him.

1017
01:23:41,985 --> 01:23:43,194
Lecter.

1018
01:23:43,612 --> 01:23:45,780
Put your hands on your head.

1019
01:23:47,866 --> 01:23:49,408
One in the leg.

1020
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:01,838
No movement.

1021
01:24:03,173 --> 01:24:06,259
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're coming into the car.

1022
01:24:06,343 --> 01:24:09,595
- We're opening the hatch.
- Watch his hands.

1023
01:24:09,721 --> 01:24:12,890
If there's any fire,
it'll come from us. Affirm.

1024
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:14,308
Got it.

1025
01:24:40,294 --> 01:24:42,378
Memphis General, 
this is Medical Unit 26.

1026
01:24:42,421 --> 01:24:45,047
We're inbound with a 50-year-old
male police officer ...

1027
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:47,550
with severe facial lacerations.
Weapon unknown.

1028
01:24:47,593 --> 01:24:50,595
We've got grand mal seizure 
activity, but he's postictal now.

1029
01:24:50,679 --> 01:24:51,762
Copy that.

1030
01:24:51,805 --> 01:24:54,724
Vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.

1031
01:24:54,766 --> 01:24:56,267
- Ninety?
- Yeah, that's right. 90.

1032
01:24:56,351 --> 01:24:57,602
Pulse, 84.

1033
01:24:57,686 --> 01:24:59,353
We've got him on 
lactated ringers running.

1034
01:24:59,438 --> 01:25:01,981
And the patient is on 10 liters ...

1035
01:25:09,156 --> 01:25:12,450
They found the ambulance in a 
parking garage at Memphis Airport.

1036
01:25:12,534 --> 01:25:14,035
The crew was dead.

1037
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,623
He killed a tourist, too.
Got his clothes, cash.

1038
01:25:19,249 --> 01:25:21,250
By now he could be anywhere.

1039
01:25:21,293 --> 01:25:23,294
- He won't come after me.
- Oh, really?

1040
01:25:23,378 --> 01:25:25,838
No, he won't. I can't explain it.

1041
01:25:25,923 --> 01:25:28,549
He would consider that rude.

1042
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,636
It's over. She's dead.

1043
01:25:31,845 --> 01:25:33,763
It's not your fault it 
worked out like this.

1044
01:25:33,805 --> 01:25:35,640
The thing is that, Lecter said 
everything we need ...

1045
01:25:35,682 --> 01:25:38,267
to catch him with is right here
in these pages, only I can't ...

1046
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:42,063
- Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.
- He's here, Ardelia.

1047
01:26:11,885 --> 01:26:13,511
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

1048
01:26:15,681 --> 01:26:18,391
"Clarice, doesn't this random 
scattering of sites ...

1049
01:26:18,475 --> 01:26:22,478
"seem desperately random?
Like the elaboration of a bad liar.

1050
01:26:22,729 --> 01:26:24,355
"Ta, Hannibal Lecter."

1051
01:26:24,439 --> 01:26:27,108
Desperately random? 
What does he mean?

1052
01:26:27,234 --> 01:26:30,361
Not random at all maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.

1053
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:35,032
Yeah, but there is no pattern, or 
the computers would have nailed it.

1054
01:26:35,117 --> 01:26:36,951
They're even found in random order.

1055
01:26:37,536 --> 01:26:41,163
Random because of the one girl.
The one he weighted down.

1056
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,791
- Fredrica Bimmel ...
- Right.

1057
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:47,169
From Belvedere, Ohio.

1058
01:26:47,629 --> 01:26:51,257
First girl taken, 
third body found. Why?

1059
01:26:51,383 --> 01:26:53,718
Well, she didn't drift.
He weighted her down.

1060
01:26:53,802 --> 01:26:56,887
What did Lecter say
about the first principles?

1061
01:26:57,264 --> 01:26:58,639
Simplicity.

1062
01:26:59,057 --> 01:27:01,559
What does this guy do? 
He covets.

1063
01:27:02,519 --> 01:27:04,812
How do we first start to covet?

1064
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:08,065
- We covet what we see ...
- Every day.

1065
01:27:10,736 --> 01:27:13,237
- Hot damn, Clarice.
- He knew her.

1066
01:28:29,147 --> 01:28:31,315
- Mr. Bimmel?
- That's me.

1067
01:28:32,317 --> 01:28:35,152
Hello. I'm Clarice Starling.
I'm with the FBI.

1068
01:28:38,698 --> 01:28:41,867
I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.

1069
01:28:42,619 --> 01:28:44,870
I don't know nothing new to tell you.

1070
01:28:44,955 --> 01:28:48,165
Police been back here
so many times already.

1071
01:28:48,542 --> 01:28:52,128
Fredrica went into Chicago 
on the bus to see about a job.

1072
01:28:52,838 --> 01:28:56,006
She left the interview okay.
She never come home.

1073
01:28:59,177 --> 01:29:01,429
Her bedroom's how she left it.

1074
01:29:01,763 --> 01:29:04,348
Upstairs. Door to the left.

1075
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:53,350
He's making himself a woman suit,
Mr. Crawford, out of real women.

1076
01:31:53,393 --> 01:31:56,353
And he can sew, this guy.
He's very skilled.

1077
01:31:56,438 --> 01:31:58,897
- He's a tailor or a dressmaker or ...
- Starling ...

1078
01:31:58,982 --> 01:32:01,400
That's why they're all so big.
He has to keep them alive ...

1079
01:32:01,484 --> 01:32:02,568
so he can starve them a while,

1080
01:32:02,652 --> 01:32:04,528
so he can loosen their skin and take ...
- Starling.

1081
01:32:04,613 --> 01:32:07,197
Starling. Starling,
we know who he is and where he is.

1082
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,533
- We're on our way right now.
- Where?

1083
01:32:09,784 --> 01:32:14,496
Calumet City, edge of Chicago.
Be on the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.

1084
01:32:14,539 --> 01:32:16,957
Oh, that's great news, 
sir, but how ...

1085
01:32:17,042 --> 01:32:18,959
Johns Hopkins came up 
with some names.

1086
01:32:19,085 --> 01:32:20,544
We fed him into "Known Offenders."

1087
01:32:20,712 --> 01:32:24,798
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb,
AKA John Grant.

1088
01:32:25,008 --> 01:32:27,384
Lecter's description is accurate.
He just lied about the name.

1089
01:32:27,469 --> 01:32:28,552
Listen to this.

1090
01:32:28,762 --> 01:32:31,013
Customs had some paper on him.

1091
01:32:31,222 --> 01:32:34,183
They stopped a carton 
two years ago at LAX.

1092
01:32:34,392 --> 01:32:36,727
Live caterpillars from Surinam.

1093
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:39,355
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1094
01:32:40,273 --> 01:32:42,274
Well, Chicago's 
only 400 miles from here.

1095
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:44,151
- I'll be there in ...
- No, no, no, Starling.

1096
01:32:44,235 --> 01:32:47,529
There's not enough time. We want 
him for murder, not kidnapping.

1097
01:32:47,697 --> 01:32:50,115
I need you to link him to the Bimmel 
girl before he's indicted.

1098
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:54,244
- See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.
- Yes, sir. You bet. I'll do my best.

1099
01:32:54,371 --> 01:32:57,623
Starling, we wouldn't have found 
him without you.

1100
01:32:58,208 --> 01:33:01,502
Nobody's gonna forget that.
Least of all me.

1101
01:33:03,088 --> 01:33:06,256
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.

1102
01:33:08,009 --> 01:33:09,426
Mr. Crawford?

1103
01:33:22,023 --> 01:33:25,943
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.
I got a better idea.

1104
01:33:47,924 --> 01:33:50,300
Okay, Precious. 
Time for a little treat.

1105
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,732
Precious!

1106
01:34:07,318 --> 01:34:08,819
Come on, girl!

1107
01:34:10,029 --> 01:34:12,656
Come on, Precious. 
Come on, Precious!

1108
01:34:21,791 --> 01:34:23,500
Come on, Precious!

1109
01:34:23,793 --> 01:34:26,336
I got a yummy, yummy snack for you.

1110
01:34:26,671 --> 01:34:28,130
Come on. Come and get it.

1111
01:34:35,054 --> 01:34:36,346
Precious!

1112
01:34:37,307 --> 01:34:39,725
Are you up there, you little shit?

1113
01:34:40,602 --> 01:34:42,853
Come and get it, pretty girl.

1114
01:34:49,944 --> 01:34:53,530
Precious. Please come. Come on.

1115
01:35:01,498 --> 01:35:02,915
Come on ...

1116
01:35:15,303 --> 01:35:16,970
Would you fuck me?

1117
01:35:17,222 --> 01:35:19,681
Come on. Take that bone. Come on.

1118
01:35:20,892 --> 01:35:23,685
Come on. Come. Come on.

1119
01:35:24,062 --> 01:35:25,521
I'd fuck me.

1120
01:35:26,105 --> 01:35:27,397
Come on.

1121
01:35:31,402 --> 01:35:33,111
I'd fuck me hard.

1122
01:35:33,571 --> 01:35:35,405
I'd fuck me so hard.

1123
01:35:40,286 --> 01:35:41,370
No.

1124
01:36:42,473 --> 01:36:44,641
Is that a good job, FBI agent?

1125
01:36:44,726 --> 01:36:48,896
You get to travel around and stuff?
I mean, better places than this?

1126
01:36:50,565 --> 01:36:52,190
Sometimes you do.

1127
01:36:53,026 --> 01:36:56,778
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.

1128
01:36:57,530 --> 01:37:01,325
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

1129
01:37:01,576 --> 01:37:03,994
She thought it was such hot shit.

1130
01:37:04,621 --> 01:37:06,830
What did she know? Big dummy.

1131
01:37:07,123 --> 01:37:09,374
Stacy, did Fredrica 
ever mention a man ...

1132
01:37:09,459 --> 01:37:13,086
named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?

1133
01:37:13,922 --> 01:37:16,006
- How about John Grant?
- No.

1134
01:37:16,424 --> 01:37:17,424
Oh, would she have had a friend ...

1135
01:37:17,508 --> 01:37:18,717
that you didn't know about, or ...

1136
01:37:18,801 --> 01:37:21,595
No way. If she had a guy, 
I'd have known, believe me.

1137
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:23,472
Sewing was her life.

1138
01:37:24,015 --> 01:37:25,891
Did you two ever work together?

1139
01:37:25,975 --> 01:37:27,976
Oh, sure. Me and Pam Malavesi
used to help her ...

1140
01:37:28,019 --> 01:37:30,562
do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman.

1141
01:37:31,022 --> 01:37:34,024
Can you give me Mrs. Lippman's 
address? I need to talk to her.

1142
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:05,722
So powerful. So beautiful.

1143
01:38:11,312 --> 01:38:12,604
Precious?

1144
01:38:18,569 --> 01:38:19,611
Precious?

1145
01:38:19,696 --> 01:38:21,905
Down here, you sack of shit!

1146
01:38:30,748 --> 01:38:31,873
Put her in that bucket.

1147
01:38:31,916 --> 01:38:35,460
No! You get me a telephone
and lower it down here. Now!

1148
01:38:38,214 --> 01:38:40,590
Poolie-poo. Precious.

1149
01:38:40,883 --> 01:38:42,551
Darling heart, are you all right?

1150
01:38:42,593 --> 01:38:45,762
She's in a lot of pain, mister.
She needs a vet.

1151
01:38:49,809 --> 01:38:52,769
She broke her leg on the way down.
I know it. She's been licking ...

1152
01:38:52,812 --> 01:38:54,896
Hey, don't you hurt my dog!

1153
01:38:54,939 --> 01:38:59,317
- Don't you make me hurt your dog!
- Oh, you don't know what pain is!

1154
01:39:04,615 --> 01:39:08,452
Get me a live telephone line 
down here or the dog's dead!

1155
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:13,832
Damn fuck.

1156
01:39:13,916 --> 01:39:15,792
Get me that telephone!

1157
01:39:17,336 --> 01:39:19,296
I'm gonna do it, mister!

1158
01:39:19,589 --> 01:39:22,924
I'll snap her neck off. 
I swear to God!

1159
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:25,635
You little fuck.

1160
01:39:32,643 --> 01:39:35,187
Down here! Down here!

1161
01:39:35,271 --> 01:39:36,563
Help!

1162
01:39:49,243 --> 01:39:51,161
Okay, I'm coming.

1163
01:39:53,247 --> 01:39:54,790
We're going in.

1164
01:39:59,462 --> 01:40:02,005
Good afternoon. 
Sorry to bother you.

1165
01:40:02,423 --> 01:40:04,174
I'm looking for 
Mrs. Lippman's family.

1166
01:40:04,842 --> 01:40:07,594
- FBI! Everybody down!
- Everybody down, now!

1167
01:40:07,929 --> 01:40:09,554
No. The Lippmans don't 
live here anymore.

1168
01:40:09,639 --> 01:40:12,724
No. Excuse me, sir.
I really need to speak with you.

1169
01:40:13,684 --> 01:40:15,435
- Clear!
- Clear!

1170
01:40:16,229 --> 01:40:18,480
What's the problem, Officer?

1171
01:40:18,564 --> 01:40:22,025
Well, I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.

1172
01:40:24,779 --> 01:40:26,279
There's no one here, Jack.

1173
01:40:28,741 --> 01:40:30,033
Clarice.

1174
01:40:30,284 --> 01:40:31,493
Your name is?

1175
01:40:31,536 --> 01:40:34,162
- Oh, Jack Gordon.
- Mr. Gordon. Good.

1176
01:40:35,081 --> 01:40:38,542
Well, Fredrica used to work
for Mrs. Lippman. Did you know her?

1177
01:40:39,210 --> 01:40:40,544
No.

1178
01:40:41,546 --> 01:40:42,796
Oh, wait.

1179
01:40:43,214 --> 01:40:45,507
Was she a great, big fat person?

1180
01:40:46,342 --> 01:40:49,052
- Yes. She was a big girl, sir.
- Yeah, I ...

1181
01:40:49,387 --> 01:40:52,222
I may have ... No, I read about 
her in the newspaper.

1182
01:40:54,225 --> 01:40:56,685
Mrs. Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.

1183
01:40:56,727 --> 01:41:00,105
I got his card in here someplace. Do you 
want to come in while I look for it?

1184
01:41:00,189 --> 01:41:01,398
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

1185
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,774
Thank you.

1186
01:41:21,544 --> 01:41:24,045
Are you close to catching somebody,
you think?

1187
01:41:25,131 --> 01:41:27,090
Yes. We may be.

1188
01:41:29,552 --> 01:41:30,760
Did you

1189
01:41:31,721 --> 01:41:34,848
take over this place after 
Mrs. Lippman died? Is that right?

1190
01:41:36,601 --> 01:41:40,645
Yeah. I bought this house 
two years ago.

1191
01:41:42,190 --> 01:41:45,317
Did she leave any records,
any business records,

1192
01:41:45,776 --> 01:41:48,862
tax forms, list of employees?

1193
01:41:50,114 --> 01:41:52,282
No. Nothing like that at all.

1194
01:41:54,577 --> 01:41:57,078
Say, has the FBI learned something?

1195
01:41:57,455 --> 01:42:00,332
The police around here
don't seem to have the first clue.

1196
01:42:10,343 --> 01:42:14,971
I mean, have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

1197
01:42:16,432 --> 01:42:17,474
No.

1198
01:42:20,353 --> 01:42:21,811
No, we don't.

1199
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:33,865
Yeah. Here's that number.

1200
01:42:35,952 --> 01:42:39,287
Very good, Mr. Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?

1201
01:42:47,838 --> 01:42:49,881
Sure you can use my phone.

1202
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:52,509
Freeze!

1203
01:42:53,302 --> 01:42:56,846
Put your hands over your head!
And turn around! Spread your legs!

1204
01:42:58,432 --> 01:43:01,935
Spread your legs! Put your hands 
in the back! Thumbs up!

1205
01:43:02,019 --> 01:43:03,019
Freeze!

1206
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:17,510
Hey!

1207
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:39,657
Hello! Are you there?

1208
01:44:41,619 --> 01:44:43,953
I'm down here! I'm down here!

1209
01:45:04,058 --> 01:45:06,810
- Catherine Martin?
- Yes!

1210
01:45:08,938 --> 01:45:11,356
FBI! You're safe!

1211
01:45:11,941 --> 01:45:14,317
Safe, shit! Get me out of here!

1212
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,043
You're all right, Catherine. 
Where is he?

1213
01:45:32,128 --> 01:45:35,171
How the fuck should I know?
Just get me out of here!

1214
01:45:35,214 --> 01:45:38,341
Catherine, you've got to be quiet.
Now shut that dog up!

1215
01:45:38,426 --> 01:45:40,510
Just get me out of here!

1216
01:45:41,637 --> 01:45:43,012
Oh, my God.

1217
01:45:45,433 --> 01:45:47,725
Catherine, I'm going to get you
out of there,

1218
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:49,519
but right now, you listen to me.

1219
01:45:49,645 --> 01:45:52,147
I've got to leave this room.
I'll be right back.

1220
01:45:52,189 --> 01:45:54,983
No! Don't you leave me here,
you fucking bitch!

1221
01:45:55,025 --> 01:45:57,527
No! Don't you leave me here!

1222
01:45:57,695 --> 01:45:59,988
This guy's fucking crazy!

1223
01:46:02,867 --> 01:46:04,492
Please!

1224
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:07,912
I've got to get out of here!

1225
01:46:10,374 --> 01:46:14,335
Catherine, the other officers 
will be here any minute now!

1226
01:46:15,337 --> 01:46:16,588
Wait!

1227
01:46:17,214 --> 01:46:19,048
Don't go! Please!

1228
01:46:19,175 --> 01:46:20,341
Quiet!

1229
01:46:22,887 --> 01:46:24,304
Oh, God!

1230
01:50:11,281 --> 01:50:12,281
No ...

1231
01:50:21,333 --> 01:50:23,710
- You okay?
- Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm okay.

1232
01:50:23,794 --> 01:50:26,921
Agent Starling, how did you track
Buffalo Bill to this address?

1233
01:50:33,137 --> 01:50:35,638
Clarice M. Starling.

1234
01:50:38,142 --> 01:50:39,767
Congratulations.

1235
01:50:52,990 --> 01:50:55,158
Ernest W. Stevens.

1236
01:51:13,761 --> 01:51:16,971
- Special Agent Starling.
- Oh, Special Agent Mapp.

1237
01:51:17,181 --> 01:51:18,598
- Phone call.
- Thank you.

1238
01:51:18,682 --> 01:51:21,017
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Starling.

1239
01:51:23,771 --> 01:51:26,230
Pilch, could you take our picture?

1240
01:51:26,774 --> 01:51:27,857
Sure.

1241
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:32,195
Look, I just wanted 
to say congratulations.

1242
01:51:32,571 --> 01:51:34,489
And I'm not much good
at this kind of thing,

1243
01:51:34,531 --> 01:51:36,365
so I'm gonna duck out of here.

1244
01:51:36,408 --> 01:51:37,700
Okay, sure.

1245
01:51:39,411 --> 01:51:41,329
Thank you, Mr. Crawford.

1246
01:51:48,962 --> 01:51:51,714
Your father would 
have been proud today.

1247
01:51:54,635 --> 01:51:56,844
Don't forget your phone call.

1248
01:52:01,058 --> 01:52:02,391
Starling.

1249
01:52:02,559 --> 01:52:06,896
Well, Clarice, have the 
lambs stopped screaming?

1250
01:52:07,564 --> 01:52:08,731
Dr. Lecter.

1251
01:52:08,982 --> 01:52:11,901
Don't bother with a trace.
I won't be on long enough.

1252
01:52:15,572 --> 01:52:19,784
- Where are you, Dr. Lecter?
- I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.

1253
01:52:19,868 --> 01:52:22,370
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

1254
01:52:22,913 --> 01:52:26,082
So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy.

1255
01:52:26,124 --> 01:52:28,584
You know I can't make that promise.

1256
01:52:29,127 --> 01:52:31,796
I do wish we 
could chat longer, but ...

1257
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:35,424
