Hi there.
I want to talk to you about ducts.

10
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:19,805
Do your ducts seem old-fashioned,
out-of-date?

11
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,905
Central Services's new duct designs...

12
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,247
are now available
in hundreds of different colors...

13
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:29,219
to suit your individual taste.

14
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:35,090
Hurry now, while stocks last,
to your nearest Central Services showroom.

15
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,995
Designer colors to suit
your demanding taste.

16
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:02,478
Tonight we have with us,
from the Ministry of Information...

17
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,251
Deputy Minister Eugene Helpmann.

18
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,258
Good evening, David.

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,694
What do you believe is behind
this recent increase in terrorist bombings?

20
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,164
Bad sportsmanship.

21
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,497
A ruthless minority of people...

22
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:20,733
seems to have forgotten certain
good old-fashioned virtues.

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,071
They just can't stand
seeing the other fella win.

24
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,702
If these people
would just play the game...

25
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,872
they'd get a lot more out of life.

26
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,780
Nevertheless, Mr. Helpmann,
there are those who maintain...

27
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,218
that the Ministry of Information
has become too large and unwieldy.

28
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,518
David, in a free society,
information's the name of the game.

29
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,389
You can't win the game
if you're a man short.

30
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,828
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister.
Seven percent of the gross national product.

31
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:49,163
I understand this concern
on behalf of the taxpayer.

32
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,169
People want value for money.

33
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:56,641
That's why we always insist on the principle
of information retrieval charges.

34
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,837
It's absolutely right and fair...

35
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,177
that those found guilty should pay
for their periods of detention...

36
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:07,777
<i>and for the information retrieval
procedures used in their interrogation.</i>

37
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,813
Do you believe that the government
is winning the battle against terrorists?

38
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,725
Oh, yes. Our morale
is much higher than theirs.

39
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,695
<i>We're fielding all their strokes,
running a lot of them out...</i>

40
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,665
and pretty consistently
knocking them for six.

41
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,428
<i>I'd say they're nearly out of the game.</i>

42
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:37,879
... law-abiding citizens
to have to subsidize criminals?

43
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:42,216
But, Mr. Helpmann, the bombing campaign
is now in its 13th year.

44
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,552
Beginner's luck.

45
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,526
Thank you very much,
Deputy Minister.

46
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,628
Thank you, David.

47
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,493
And a very merry Christmas
to you all.

48
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,092
<i>"Scrooge was better than his word.</i>

49
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:00,331
<i>"He did it all, and infinitely more.</i>

50
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,466
<i>"And to Tiny Tim, who did not die...</i>

51
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,568
"he became a second father.

52
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:11,082
"He became as good a friend
in the good old worid.

53
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,483
"And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

54
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,920
God bless us, every one."

55
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,727
- Are you boys giving me the runaround?
- Where are you?

56
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,027
Step right up. This way. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

57
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,192
Don't throw that.
That's only for long distance.

58
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,202
All right.

59
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,034
- I'm sorry, boys, but we haven't got any vacancies.
- Got no vacancies.

60
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,665
- We got plenty of rooms.
- That's all right. We take a room.

61
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,710
- All right.
- All right. We take a vacancy.

62
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,439
Boy, take the gentlemen's baggage.

63
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,216
Who's there?

64
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,189
Who is that?

65
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:58,253
Father Christmas can't come
if we haven't got a chimney.

66
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,764
You'll see.

67
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:18,979
No!

68
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,986
What's going on?

69
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,253
No!

70
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,382
I hereby inform you,
under powers entrusted to me...

71
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:56,785
under section 47, paragraph 7
of council order number 438476...

72
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,723
That Mr. Buttle, Archibald, residing at
412 North Tower, Shangrila Towers...

73
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,796
has been invited to assist the Ministry
of Information with certain inquiries...

74
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,456
and that he is liable to
certain financial obligations...

75
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:11,765
as specified in council order
RB/CZ/907/X.

76
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,771
Sign here, please.

77
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,675
Where are you taking him?

78
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,440
There.

79
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,846
Thank you.
Same again, please.

80
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,011
Just there.
Press harder his time.

81
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,488
- Good.
- What is this all about?

82
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,152
That is your receipt for your husband.
Thank you.

83
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,388
And this is my receipt for your receipt.

84
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,692
<i>Mrs. Buttle, are you okay?</i>

85
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,300
- Ho! Ho!
- We're Department of Works!

86
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,238
<i>Department of Works up here.!</i>

87
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,400
<i>Careful with those bloody things.</i>

88
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,511
Don't take any notice of them, love.

89
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,979
Don't touch me.
Why don't you just get the hell out of here.

90
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,017
Don't you worry, love.
We'll have everything shipshape in a jiffy.

91
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:03,384
- That's it. Nothing to worry about.
- Right. It's Tuttle downstairs who can worry, eh?

92
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:06,720
Tuttle? His name's Buttle.
There must be some mistake.

93
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,727
Mistake?
We don't make mistakes.

94
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:14,228
That's bloody typical.

95
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,824
They've gone back to metric
without telling us.

96
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,268
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

97
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,340
Yeah.

98
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,699
"Buttle."

99
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,070
Buttle, Archibald.

100
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,536
Ridiculous name.

101
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,038
On the twenty...

102
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,580
Oh, shit.

103
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,583
Mr...

104
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,483
Mr. Lowry, would you
step in here, please?

105
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,390
Ah.

106
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,528
I say, h-has anybody seen Lowry?

107
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:04,062
Has anybody seen Sam Lowry?

108
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,933
Sam.

109
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,714
Sam.

110
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,275
- Hello.
- Hello? Sam. Where are you?

111
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,540
- Hello?
- It's 11:00.

112
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,775
- What?
- 11:00!

113
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,216
- Mr. Kurtzmann.
- Yes.

114
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,913
You're up late.

115
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,252
- It's 11:00.
- Is it?

116
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,256
Oh. The electrics here are up the spout.

117
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,663
- I know. Look...
- Oh, yours too?

118
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,203
- Yes.
- Oh, well, um, I'll be there as soon as I can.

119
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,204
- Yes. Thanks. Bye.
- Hurry up.

120
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,349
Hello, Sammy.

121
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,789
What have you got to say?

122
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,845
Oh, very good, Sammy.

123
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:49,358
<i>... famous statue
pairing truth and freedom.</i>

124
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,403
This is not the only statue...
Shut up!

125
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,030
<i>What's this gun for?</i>

126
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,668
This one, Sister,
is a nine-millimeter submachine gun...

127
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,076
<i>used for close-quarter combat fighting.</i>

128
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,444
<i>Very effective weapon.
Would you like to see it?</i>

129
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,281
<i>Sam!</i>

130
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,807
Jack!

131
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,581
- Well...
- Long time no see.

132
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,213
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

133
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,054
I don't expect to see you
slumming it in Records.

134
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,721
- What's the problem?
- Problem? No problem.
Everything's fine. Wonderful. Marvelous.

135
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,890
<i>Alison's in great shape.
Kids are fine.</i>

136
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,560
<i>I'm on Security Level 5 now,
so Mr. Helpmann relies on me more and more.</i>

137
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,298
- It's been a great year.
- You sound worried.

138
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,432
Worried? Me?
If I'm worried about anyone, Sam, it's you.

139
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:06,841
<i>I mean, look at you, Sam.
Whatever happened to you?</i>

140
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,743
Records?

141
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,611
<i>Sam, you were one of the brightest...</i>

142
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,525
Sam?

143
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,628
Uh, Jack, it's great to see you.

144
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,859
- I'm gonna be late.
- Sam.

145
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,801
Let a friend tell you.
Your life is going wrong.

146
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,839
Records is a dead-end department.
No security level worth a damn.

147
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,306
- It's impossible to get noticed.
- I know.

148
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,969
Wonderful. Marvelous.

149
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,309
Perfect. See you, Jack.

150
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,144
- Give my regards to Alison and the twins.
- Triplets.

151
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,687
Triplets? God.
How time flies.

152
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,557
A very clear delineation of picture this has.
Adamant, mobile.

153
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,628
Next.

154
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,965
<i>I want to report a wrongful arrest.</i>

155
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,299
You want Information Adjustments.
Different department.

156
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,306
I've been to Information Adjustments.

157
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,502
They sent me here. They said
you have a form I need to fill out.

158
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,806
Have you got an arrest receipt?

159
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,678
Yeah.

160
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:21,378
- Is it stamped?
- Stamped?

161
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,449
No, no.
There's no stamp on it, you see.

162
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,789
I can't let you have the form
until this is stamped.

163
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:34,229
- Where do I get it stamped?
- Information Adjustments.

164
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,775
It's nothing. It's nothing.

165
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,843
<i>It keeps picking up old films.</i>

166
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,011
That can't be right, can it?

167
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,179
Perhaps the machine's on the blink.

168
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,690
No, it's not the machine. There's a mismatch
on the personnel code numbers.

169
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:05,457
Tuttle should have had £31.06 debited
against his account, not Buttle.

170
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,692
- My God! A mistake!
- Well, at least it's not ours.

171
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,769
Isn't it? Whose is it?

172
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,531
- Information Retrieval.
- Oh, good.

173
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,199
Yeah. See, Expediting has put in
for electrical procedures...

174
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,869
in respect of Buttle, Archibald,
shoe repair operative...

175
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,109
but Security has invoiced Admin
for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer.

176
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,741
Oh, what a relief.
Finish your tea, Sam.

177
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,343
What? Oh. Thanks.

178
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,920
I don't know what I would do
if you ever got promoted.

179
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,484
- Oh, God, don't worry about that.
- No, but if they did promote you, uh...

180
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,899
I've told you before.
I'd turn it down.

181
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,935
- Would you? Really?
- Really.

182
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,504
You've been promoted.

183
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,735
It's your mother, isn't it?
Pulling strings again.

184
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:03,182
Sam, it's time for you
to grow up and accept responsibility.

185
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:07,918
Your poor father would be appalled
at your lack of promotion. Ooh!

186
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,622
Mother, I just wish
you would stop interfering.

187
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,995
I don't want promotion.
I'm happy where I am.

188
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,501
No, you're not.
Jack Lint is a lesson to you.

189
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,732
He doesn't have your brains,
but he's got the ambition.

190
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,831
You haven't got the ambition.

191
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,809
<i>Luckily, you've got me
and the deputy minister.</i>

192
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,075
- Mr. Helpmann was very close to your father.
- Now, please, Mrs. Lowry.

193
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,275
Don't get upset.

194
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,875
Mr. Lowry, please wait in reception.
You're giving her wrinkles.

195
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,887
- You see?
- God!

196
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,617
Just try and relax, Mrs. Lowry.

197
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,625
I'll make you 20 years younger.

198
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,060
- Ha!
- Yoo-hoo, Dr. Jaffe. You are a genius.

199
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,689
Would you like to be surgeon general?

200
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,234
I know simply everybody.

201
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,327
Well, they won't know you
when I've finished with you.

202
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,465
First...

203
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,736
we remove the excess derma.

204
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,744
So.

205
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:06,011
Now the flaccid tissues
under the eyes and the forehead.

206
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,847
- Zip.
- Oh.

207
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,088
Now, I lift...

208
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,490
the wrinkles and the worry lines...

209
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,085
right up into the wig,
into the hairline.

210
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,030
<i>Now the template.</i>

211
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,699
- Mercy.
- There. Now a bit of sticky.

212
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,705
Like so.

213
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:32,675
And already she's twice as beautiful
as she was before. Voilà!

214
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,874
<i>Mr. Helpmann was very close
to your poor father.</i>

215
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,917
He was very close to me.

216
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,918
Still is.

217
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,947
He'll take you under his wing
when you get to Information Retrieval.

218
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,323
- Thank you, sir.
- You'll like it there.

219
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,555
<i>You're not listening to me, Mother.</i>

220
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,959
<i>What the hell is this, lady?</i>

221
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,836
It's a present for my son. Really!

222
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,398
I hope you like it.
It's very exclusive.

223
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,512
What on earth is it?

224
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:12,573
Something for an executive.

225
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,279
Ah, Madame Lowry.

226
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,084
You look exquisite today.
Merry Christmas.

227
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,625
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.

228
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,161
- Sorry.
- Uh, you remember my son, Samuel.

229
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,959
- Of course.
- We're joining Mrs. Terrain.

230
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:30,466
- Yes. The lady's waiting.
- Are we? God.

231
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,597
This way.

232
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,800
Mother. Mother, I thought we were
going to be able to talk.

233
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,969
<i>- We will. We will.
- Ida, Sam.</i>

234
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,808
<i>- Oh, God. She's got what's her name with her.
- Yoo-hoo.!</i>

235
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,145
Sam!

236
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:50,051
Well, Alma. How are you?
You look wonderful.

237
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,919
Hello, Shirley.

238
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,516
Thank you, Spiro.

239
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,720
- Salt?
- Not yet.

240
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,195
Sam, happy Christmas.

241
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,326
<i>- So sorry we're late.
- Thanks.</i>

242
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,870
<i>Now, Alma...</i>

243
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,940
what are you going to have?

244
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,807
I can't make up my mind whether
to have the number one or the number two.

245
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,244
- What do you recommend, Spiro?
- Between you and me, madame...

246
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,248
today the number two.

247
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,751
Thank you, Spiro.
Shirley. Shirley, what are you going to have?

248
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:26,085
Between you and me, mademoiselle,
today the number one.

249
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:30,059
- Madame Lowry?
- Oh, to hell with the diet.

250
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,323
I'm going to have a number eight, please.

251
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,889
- A most perceptive choice if I dare say so, madame.
- Oh, Ida!

252
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,901
- Monsieur.
- Steak, please. Rare. Mother...

253
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,029
<i>- Monsieur, quel numéro?
- I don't know which number. Mother, please...</i>

254
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,505
- That one. There.
- That's fine. Thanks.

255
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,339
- Mother, will you please listen to me.
- Alma! You wicked girl.

256
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,539
- You've started your treatment.
- Say the number, please.

257
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,947
- You noticed.
- You have to say the number!

258
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,815
- Will you please go away! I'm trying to talk...
- I must tell you all about it.

259
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,889
Number three.

260
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,092
Mother, will you listen to me.
I haven't...

261
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,320
<i>Numéro huit.</i>

262
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,695
Braised veal in wine sauce.

263
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:15,899
<i>It's too exciting.
I've left Dr. Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.</i>

264
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,636
<i>- Numéro deux. Duck à I'orange.
- Dr. Chapman? Chapman?</i>

265
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,644
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

266
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,146
The acid man?

267
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,649
Really, Ida! Just because
his techniques are revolutionary...

268
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,983
I don't go around
calling Dr. Jaffe the knife man.

269
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,648
<i>Numéro un, crevettes à la mayonnaise.</i>

270
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:36,592
- I am sorry, Alma. I didn't mean to sound so...
- It's all right, Ida. It's just...

271
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:40,631
<i>Steak. Numéro trois.</i>

272
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,966
<i>Mesdames, monsieur...</i>

273
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,095
<i>bon appétit.</i>

274
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,400
<i>- Merci.
- Merci.</i>

275
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:53,842
Acid, on the other hand, can be used
for such wonderfully subtle shading.

276
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,936
Such delicate nuances.

277
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,278
Like a Rembrandt etching.

278
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,817
- And it is so much quicker.
- God!

279
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,377
If it wasn't for this complication... the doctor says
it could have happened to anybody...

280
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,389
I'd have had this dressing off yesterday.

281
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,823
Shirley.

282
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,758
Salt?

283
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,319
What were we saying?

284
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,720
- This isn't rare.
- Oh! By the by, Alma...

285
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:43,556
I saw the most wonderful idea
for Christmas presents at the chemist's.

286
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,495
Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.

287
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,498
Oh, that sounds marvelous!

288
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,036
It's good at any doctor's
and most of the major hospitals.

289
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,664
It's also accepted
for gynecological examinations...

290
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,174
<i>including cesarean section.</i>

291
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,006
- Spiro.
- I'm sorry, madame. I don't know what to say.

292
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,081
It never really happens to us.

293
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,376
I'm going to do something
about it straightaway.

294
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:09,181
Really, Sam! Why can't you
do something about these terrorists?

295
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:12,313
It's my lunch hour.

296
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,483
Besides, it's not my department.

297
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:19,155
Actually, Alma, that was one of
the little things I've been dying to tell you.

298
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:24,395
Look. Sam's been promoted
to Information Retrieval.

299
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:28,405
Oh, that's wonderful!
Congratulations, Sam!

300
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:32,238
Stop it! I'm not being promoted.
I'm not going to Information Retrieval.

301
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,973
If I want you to stick your oar in, Mother,
I'll tell you where to stick it.

302
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,986
Pepper?

303
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,522
I've gotta go.

304
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,422
- Sam, you haven't had your dessert.
- I don't want dessert.

305
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,928
- I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
- Of course you want something.

306
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,863
You must have hopes, wishes, dreams!

307
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,332
No, nothing. Not even dreams.

308
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,006
Sam.

309
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:42,980
Sam!

310
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:26,217
Oh, God.

311
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,379
Hello. Central Services?

312
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:54,543
I'm at 579B, Block 19,
Northwestern Section "D."

313
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,884
That's exit one on Green Pastures Highway
at the Orange Blossom Flyover.

314
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:01,481
And I've got trouble with my air-conditioning.
It's an emergency.

315
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,493
Thank you for calling Central Services.

316
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,495
I'm sorry.
Due to temporary staff shortage...

317
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:10,296
Central Services cannot take service calls
centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours.

318
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,997
- Have a nice day. This has not been a recording.
- This is an emergency.

319
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,403
Thank you for calling Central Services.
I'm sorry. Due to...

320
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:19,739
- No. I've got to have a heating engineer.
- Thank you for calling Central Services.

321
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,744
Oh, shit.

322
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,271
Hello.

323
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,709
- Hello.
- Hello.

324
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,152
- Hello.
- Hello.

325
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,349
- Hello.
- Hello.

326
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,693
Hello. Mr. Lowry.

327
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,763
Yes. Who is this?

328
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:16,300
Put the phone down
and raise your hands.

329
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,369
What? Who is this?

330
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,841
Nice and easy now.

331
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,910
Nice and easy.

332
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,643
Just keep your hands
where I can see them.

333
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,107
What... What are you doing?

334
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,545
Harry Tuttle.
Heating engineer at your service.

335
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,747
Tuttle?

336
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,758
Are you from Central Services?

337
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,634
I called Central Services.

338
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:26,169
Well, they're a little
overworked these days.

339
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,432
Luckily I intercepted your call.

340
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,304
You did...

341
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,675
<i>Just a minute.
What was that business with the gun?</i>

342
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,714
It's just a precaution, sir.

343
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,716
Just a precaution.

344
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,753
I've had traps set for me before now.

345
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:45,345
And there are plenty of people
in Central Services...

346
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,618
who'd love to
get their hands on Harry Tuttle.

347
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,056
Are you telling me that this is illegal?

348
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:02,436
Well, yes and no. Officially, only Central Service
operatives are supposed to touch this stuff.

349
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,440
- Would you hold this, please?
- Uh...

350
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,840
But nowadays,
with all the new rules and regulations...

351
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,913
they can't get decent staff anymore.

352
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,914
So they tend to turn a blind eye
as long as I'm careful.

353
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:15,315
Mind you, if ever they could prove
that I've been working on their equipment...

354
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,650
well, that's a pipe of a different color.

355
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,554
- Wouldn't it be simpler just to work...
- Would you hold this for me?

356
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:24,094
Sorry. Yes. I was saying, wouldn't it be simpler
to work with Central Services?

357
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,686
Nah! Nah. Couldn't stand the pa...

358
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,528
We're getting warm.

359
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:33,001
- You couldn't what? Couldn't stand the what?
- Paperwork. Couldn't stand the paperwork.

360
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,471
Listen. This whole system of yours
could be on fire...

361
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:40,738
and I couldn't even turn on a kitchen tap
without filling out a 27 B/6.

362
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:43,541
Bloody paperwork.

363
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,843
I suppose one has to
expect a certain amount.

364
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,919
Why? I came into this game
for the action, the excitement.

365
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:54,151
Go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out,
wherever there's trouble, a man alone.

366
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:58,195
Now they got the whole country sectioned off.
You can't make a move without a form.

367
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,812
Found it.

368
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,814
There's your problem.

369
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,850
- Can you fix it?
- No, I can't.

370
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:23,648
But I can bypass it
with one of these.

371
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,892
Fine by me.

372
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,098
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

373
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,001
- Get down!
- Wait! Wait! Will you wait!

374
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,009
Shh.

375
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,307
The flashlight.

376
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,184
Central Services.

377
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,186
- Central Services.
- Oh, yes.

378
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,188
- You rang, sir?
- You rang, sir?

379
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,588
- Trouble with your air-conditioning?
- Air-conditioning, sir?

380
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,025
No, it's... it's... it's, uh, all right.

381
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:07,188
It's, um... It's fixed.

382
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,993
- Fixed.
- Fixed?

383
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,000
Yes, um...

384
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,297
I mean, it, um, fixed itself.

385
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,964
- Oh, it fixed itself!
- Fixed itself?

386
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,269
Yes!

387
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,276
Machines don't fix themselves.

388
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,573
No, they don't fix themselves, sir.

389
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,081
- He's tampered with it, Dowser.
- I think he's tampered with it, Mr. Spoor.

390
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,084
Sorry you've had a wasted journey.

391
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,086
Oh, that's all right.

392
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,656
<i>- I think we'll go have a little look.
- No, you can't.</i>

393
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:35,021
I think we should.
Yes, Mr. Spoor.

394
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,458
Have you got a 27 B/6?

395
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,053
27 B/6?

396
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,064
27 B/6?

397
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,498
<i>27...</i>

398
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,404
Now look what you've done to him!

399
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:52,533
Well, have you got a 27 B/6?

400
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,408
Not... as such.

401
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,681
But we'll get one.

402
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:02,150
- It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
- It's all right, then?

403
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,586
Sorry. I'm a bit of a stickler
for paperwork, you see.

404
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,750
I mean, where would we be
if we didn't stick to the correct procedures?

405
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,260
We'll be back.

406
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,421
We'll be back!

407
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,030
It's all right.

408
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,036
Thanks for coming.

409
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,038
We'll be back,
you bloody little bastard!

410
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,665
<i>- Thank you.
- We'll show you.!</i>

411
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,075
Well...

412
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:35,084
Thanks, Lowry.
You're a good man in a tight corner.

413
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,211
Thanks.

414
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,483
Listen, um... I, uh...

415
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,188
Well, I...

416
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,594
I just happen to work
at the Ministry of Information.

417
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,190
- What?
- And, uh...

418
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:54,863
Well, I just happen to know
that Information Retrieval...

419
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,602
are looking for an Archibald Tuttle,
heating engineer.

420
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,544
You, uh...

421
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,944
You wouldn't, by any chance...

422
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,743
Would you?

423
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,749
My good friends call me Harry.

424
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,717
Information Retrieval, huh?

425
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,157
The big boys.

426
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,832
What do they want you for?

427
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,840
- Time to go.
- Sorry.

428
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,409
How's that?

429
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,415
Listen, you, um... you really must
let me give you something.

430
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,355
How much will it be for the, uh...
for the work?

431
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,358
Ah, come on.

432
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,429
You did me a favor.
Just check the corridor.

433
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,666
Oh. Well, thanks.

434
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,669
Listen, kid,
we're all in it together.

435
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,069
- Go on.
- Right.

436
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:10,376
Okay.

437
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,021
All clear.

438
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,710
I think Kurtzmann
is getting suspicious.

439
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,151
What's playing today?

440
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,157
<i>Casablanca.</i>

441
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,228
<i>Mr. Lowry, will you step in here, please.</i>

442
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,267
<i>Lowry.!</i>

443
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,327
<i>Sam Lowry.!</i>

444
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,447
Psst!

445
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,978
Thank God you're here.
We're in terrible trouble.

446
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,713
Shh.

447
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,191
- Look at this. Look at this.
- It's a check.

448
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,197
It's the refund for Tuttle.

449
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,199
- Tuttle?
- Mm-hmm.

450
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,202
No, no. Buttle.
I mean Buttle.

451
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,499
It's been confusion
from the word go.

452
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,508
He's been overcharged for
Information Retrieval procedures...

453
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,511
and someone somewhere
is trying to make us carry the can.

454
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:52,049
Can I have a look?
I've never seen a refund check before.

455
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,118
I'll bet it's Jeffries.

456
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,120
Yes.

457
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:01,123
He always believes that people should
pay more for their interrogation.

458
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,125
And "B," he loathes me.

459
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,127
We've gotta get rid of it!

460
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,129
Well, send it to somebody else.

461
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,132
Better still, send it to Buttle.
After all, it's his check.

462
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,634
I've tried that.
But look. Look at this.

463
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:16,696
You see? The population census
has gotten him down as "dormanted."

464
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:20,208
Uh, the Central Collective Storehouse computer
has got him down as "deleted."

465
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,211
Hang on.

466
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,713
Information Retrieval
has got him down as "inoperative."

467
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,783
Security has got him down as "excised."

468
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,614
<i>- Administration has him down as "completed."
- He's dead.</i>

469
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,711
Le...

470
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,790
Dead?

471
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,991
Well, that's awful.

472
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,459
We'll never get rid
of the damn thing now.

473
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,800
What we gonna do, Sam?

474
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,805
Could try next of kin.

475
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,807
Next of kin!

476
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,400
Yes!

477
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,513
There we go.
Buttle. Veronica. Mrs.

478
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,518
Veronica?

479
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,520
What's the number on the check?

480
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:08,319
Uh, 27156789...

481
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:14,660
/074328K.

482
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,102
Right. Into memory.

483
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,506
Central Banking.

484
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,176
Veronica Buttle.

485
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,177
Mrs.

486
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,247
Deposit.

487
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,996
Thank God for that.

488
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,998
Uh, would you like some tea?

489
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:02,771
There's a problem.
She doesn't have a bank account.

490
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,253
Well, that's it, then.

491
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,189
I might just as well
go and hang myself now.

492
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,722
This sort of thing could never have happened
before this stupid seventh-tier reorganization.

493
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:24,961
That's Simmons's doing. And he and Jeffries
always sit together at lunch.

494
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,764
Bastards!

495
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,839
Sh... Shh. Shh.

496
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:37,513
Perhaps we could lose the thing behind
a filing cabinet or something... burn it, eat it.

497
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,515
Look, there is one solution.

498
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,517
<i>What?</i>

499
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,917
Drive out to Mrs. Buttle,
let her sign the back of the check.

500
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:47,115
She can cash it
at the corner sweet shop.

501
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,192
That's brilliant, Sam.

502
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,194
I'll even do it for you.

503
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,696
Here, authorize the check.
What's the address?

504
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,266
Everything's in here.

505
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,962
Uh, w-what should I do next?

506
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:07,041
Pink and blue receipts.
Sign there, there and there.

507
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,271
<i>- And sign the check there.
- Yes.</i>

508
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,978
I think I've broken a bone.

509
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,988
Look, my wrist is all limp.

510
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,490
What a pathetic creature I am!

511
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,753
Here.

512
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,159
I'll do it for you.

513
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,648
Right.

514
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,843
I'll be on my way.

515
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,182
<i>Sam?</i>

516
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,884
You are good to me, you know.

517
00:39:55,993 --> 00:40:00,054
<i>- Here's looking at you, kid.

531
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,195
Hello. I wonder
if you could tell me where the...

532
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,265
Piss off!

533
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,496
Hello.

534
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,574
I'll never confess!

535
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,940
Hey, come on!
You gotta interrogate me!

536
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,110
Mrs. Buttle?

537
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:59,211
Uh, Mrs. Buttle?

538
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:10,260
Ah. Um, are you Mrs. Buttle?

539
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,998
Um...

540
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,192
my name's Lowry.

541
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,704
Uh, Sam Lowry.

542
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,673
Um, I'm from
the Ministry of Information.

543
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:33,246
I've come to give you a check.

544
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,653
Um, it's a refund, actually.

545
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:43,727
- There was a mistake.
- Mistake?

546
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,727
Yes, yes.
Not in my department, of course.

547
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,729
I'm only Records.

548
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:50,391
No, it, uh...
I'll tell you what it is.

549
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:54,232
It seems that Mr. Buttle was overcharged
by Information Retrieval.

550
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:58,270
Yes, they don't usually make mistakes,
but, uh...

551
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,775
well, I suppose we're all human.

552
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,914
Oh!

553
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:07,984
What happened to the, um...

554
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:16,123
Actually, you know, my coming here
is rather unorthodox, bringing you this check...

555
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:20,185
as any payments are normally
made through Central Computer, but, um...

556
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:24,165
Well, as there were
certain... difficulties...

557
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,237
we thought,
well, rather than cause delay...

558
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,568
we'd let you have it now.

559
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:32,801
You know, it being Christmas and all.

560
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,538
My husband's dead, isn't he?

561
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:41,383
Um, I do assure you, Mrs. Buttle,
the ministry is very scrupulous...

562
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:44,318
about following up
and eradicating any error.

563
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,254
But if you do have any complaints
you wish to make...

564
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,590
I'd be, well, only too happy
to send you the appropriate forms.

565
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,163
What have you done with his body?

566
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,429
Oh!
Gosh.

567
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:03,438
Um, I-I don't know
anything about that, Mrs. Buttle.

568
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,440
I'm really just delivering the check.

569
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:11,276
So, if, um... Look, if you wouldn't mind
just signing these two receipts...

570
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:15,842
I'd be only too happy to, uh...
to leave you in peace.

571
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,444
He hadn't done anything.

572
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,455
He was good!

573
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,586
What have you done
with his body?

574
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,000
It isn't being very helpful, Mrs. Buttle.

575
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,146
I didn't have to come here,
you know, Mrs. Buttle.

576
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:48,150
I'll kill you!

577
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,152
I'll kill you, you bastard!

578
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:01,655
Hey!

579
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,858
Get off!

580
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,992
Are you all right?

581
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,339
Are you all right?

582
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:16,212
<i>Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?</i>

583
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:18,178
It's you!

584
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:21,251
Wait! Stop! Don't go! Stop!

585
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,575
<i>Oh, look.! He'll never get that out.!</i>

586
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:36,452
Stop! I had nothing
to do with it! Wait!

587
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,528
Stop!

588
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,597
<i>He's coming back.!</i>

589
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:57,142
Jesus Christ!

590
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,544
Jesus...

591
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,882
- Go away.
- Her name's Jill.

592
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,081
What? Jill?

593
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:10,126
Jill who? Jill who?

594
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:12,627
Layton.

595
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:17,298
Jill Layton.

596
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:20,768
You're a very good little girl.
What are you doing here?

597
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,066
Waiting for my daddy.

598
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,142
He will be pleased
when he gets home.

599
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:14,919
Sam, I've just
had the Transport Pool onto me.

600
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:18,222
You don't anything about a personnel transporter
gone missing, do you?

601
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:21,195
Personnel transporter? What?

602
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:24,529
<i>- Oh, the prannets. I had a personal transporter.
- Huh.</i>

603
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,535
I'll do the paperwork in the morning.

604
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:30,038
Um, is it all right about Mrs. Tuttl...

605
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,371
<i>Uh, Buttle's check?</i>

606
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,377
- Uh-huh.
- Can I forget it?

607
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,538
- Yeah.
- Oh, what a relief.

608
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,912
I'm gonna have nightmares, you know.

609
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,811
- Oh, damn and blast!
- What's the matter?

610
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,985
I don't suppose you'd happen to know
how I can get round an I RQ/3, do you?

611
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:54,063
Ooh, all information
on third-level suspects is classified.

612
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:58,601
All inquiries through Information Retrieval,
and that's hopeless. They never tell you anything.

613
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:02,035
Come the time
they want something from us, oh, yes.

614
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:06,667
There is one way I could get round it.
I could accept my mother's promotion.

615
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,677
Yes.

616
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,838
No!

617
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,075
You can't.
You've just turned it down.

618
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,344
I didn't sign the form.

619
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,454
I did it for you.

620
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,420
- You didn't.
- I did.

621
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,084
You didn't!

622
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,355
I did!

623
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,090
What did you do that for?

624
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:31,224
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

625
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:34,099
Oh, I don't know.

626
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:36,331
I don't know what I want.

627
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:40,410
Come on,
before they turn the lights out.

628
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,593
<i>There is one way round it.</i>

629
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:02,654
<i>I could always accept promotion
to Information Retrieval.</i>

630
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,867
Sam!

631
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,407
Oh, Christ.

632
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:25,106
What are you doing?
What... My God! What's going on?

633
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:28,439
<i>- Emergency procedures.
- Emergency procedures.!</i>

634
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,911
- I haven't got an emergency!
- Yeah?

635
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:34,916
- This is an emergency!
- Have a nice day.
This has not been a recording.

636
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,648
<i>Here. Sign that.</i>

637
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,522
- What is it?
- A 27 B/6.

638
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,788
What do you think it is?
Where's he gone?

639
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:48,490
<i>Spoor, come here.!
Look.! I got it.! I found it.!</i>

640
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:51,567
Spoor! Spoor!
Come here, Spoor!

641
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:55,297
It's a bypass valve on this...
on the transformer.

642
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:04,145
Tuttle!

643
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:06,545
Tuttle. It's Tuttle.

644
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,011
You've had that scab Tuttle here,
ain't ya?

645
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,816
What are you talking about?

646
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,824
- Who fixed your ducts? Huh?
- Fixed your ducts, all right.

647
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,985
I told you before...
they fixed themselves.

648
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:20,995
Oh, yeah? Then where did this
come from, eh?

649
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:23,759
Out of your nostril? Eh?

650
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,335
Nostrils, eh?

651
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,872
Central Services.

652
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,109
They don't take kindly to sabotage.

653
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:37,669
Sabotage, huh?

654
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:42,451
Jesus, this place is in a terrible state.

655
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,487
<i>Just a minute.!
You're not gonna leave it like this, are you?</i>

656
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:49,355
Why not? All you gotta do
is blow your nose and it's fixed, innit?

657
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,393
That's right!

658
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,462
Well...

659
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,089
Oh, my...

660
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,168
Jesus!

661
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:33,492
<i>What have you done with his body?</i>

662

Um...

671
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:31,439
thanks.

672
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:34,374
- It's reply paid.
- Is it?

673
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:37,275
Oh. Um...

674

No.

678
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:51,026
Oh. Sorry.

679
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:57,394
Aren't you a bit late?
I mean, the party started an hour ago.

680
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,559
Yeah. It's the backlog.
Everybody complains.

681
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:01,637
- Oh.
- Was it all right otherwise?

682
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:15,817
Mr. Helpmann, I'm keen to
get into Information Retrieval.

683
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:18,945
Mr. Helpmann, I'm dying
to get at this woman. No, no... Ohh!

684
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,023
Oh, God.

685
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:27,728
- Hold up.
- What? Who are you?

686
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,731
- Hey! What's going on?
- Where's your invitation?

687
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:34,325
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Mother! Mother!

688
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:36,337
Sam.

689
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:39,169
I'm so glad you came.

690
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:41,675
Come in.

691
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:44,508
- Mother?
- Come in.

692
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:47,948
Oh, God, Mother, is that you?

693
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:50,952
Of course.
Isn't it wonderful?

694
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:54,353
The bandages came off just this afternoon.

695
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:58,359
Come on, darling. Join in the fun.
Simply everybody's here.

696
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:00,361
Is Mr. Helpmann here?

697
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:02,363
- Would you stop shoving...
- Yes, he is.

698
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:05,366
Mr. Helpmann is here,
and he wants to talk to you.

699
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:07,698
Good. I want to talk to him.

700
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:11,865
He says that you're the first person
ever to refuse a promotion.

701
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:14,375
- Ah, well...
- He thinks you should see a doctor.

702
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:18,311
- Actually, Mother, I've decided...
- Oh, Louis! Louis, you know Sam.

703
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:20,814
Can you believe it?

704
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:23,715
It's just me and my little knife.

705
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,721
- Snip, snip, slice, slice.
- It's marvelous.

706
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:29,724
- Can you believe it?
- Congratulations.

707
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,522
- But this is just the beginning.
- Oh, really?

708
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,621
Oh, Christ, yes.
You've seen her with her clothes off.

709
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:38,929
Faces are a doddle
compared to tits and ass.

710
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:42,004
- No hairline.
- Oh, really, Louis!

711
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,941
I've been looking for you
everywhere, Ida.

712
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,381
Mother. Mother, I have to
talk to Mr. Helpmann.

713
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:57,112
- Oh, you stupid sod.
- Dear boy.

714
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,484
What do you think of your mother now?

715
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,557
<i>It'll never last.</i>

716
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,793
Excuse me.

717
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:08,420
Dr. Chapman,
did you say something?

718
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:10,499
That technique... I've tried it.

719
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,001
Oh, nice effect,
but highly unstable.

720
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:18,301
<i>In six months
she'll look like Grandma Moses.</i>

721
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:23,311
Now, see here, Chapman, at least mine
don't end up looking like they've been mugged.

722
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:26,007
Sam! Sam!

723
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:32,986
<i>What have you done with his body?</i>

724
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:35,785
Sam!

725
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,291
<i>Sam?</i>

726
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:41,295
- What on earth's happened to you?
- There was a little complication.

727
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:46,596
Dr. Chapman says it often happens
with a delicate skin like mine.

728
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,603
Nothing to worry about.

729
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:52,163
He's promised me these bandages
will be off in a jiffy.

730
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:55,108
- Actually, there's someone I want to meet.
- Oh, I know.

731
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,509
I know.

732
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:02,284
There we are.

733
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:06,116
I'm going to leave
you two lovebirds in peace.

734
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,490
Hello, Shirley.

735
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:13,084
- Oh, God.
- Come on!

736
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:15,164
Do you want a drink?

737
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,232
Oh. Hello.

738
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:23,237
Chase those years away!

739
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,705
Listen, Shirley...

740
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:29,869
your mother and my mother,
they seem to have got the idea that...

741
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:32,379
Look, I'm very flattered
and, uh, well...

742
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:35,383
I just don't want you to be
under any false impressions.

743
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,385
It's all right.

744
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,785
I don't like you either.

745
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:43,325
<i>Sam.!</i>

746
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,458
Jack.
Excuse me, Shirley.

747
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:50,259
I'm s... I'm sorry.

748
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,667
<i>- Sam! You remember Alison?
- Evening.</i>

749
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,467
Alison. Sam Lowry.
Old friend.

750
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:59,803
Alison, yes, of course.

751
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:02,810
- You look different.
- Well, I'm two years older.

752
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:05,039
- And she's been to Dr. Jaffe.
- Ah.

753
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:08,174
She doesn't like me telling people,
but, in fact, she's really pleased.

754
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:12,015
- I knew there was something different.
- Remember how they used to stick out?

755
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:16,182
What? Oh, yes.
Uh, well, rather.

756
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:19,591
- Always used to wonder if they were real.
- What, my ears?

757
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,863
Sorry?

758
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,092
Dr. Jaffe pinned her ears back.

759
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,101
Yes, that's what I...

760
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:29,467
Always used to wonder
if she wore falsies.

761
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:31,836
Ah! Mr. Helpmann.

762
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:34,808
False ears...
Mr. Helpmann!

763
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,537
- Hello, Jack.
- You remember my wife, Alison?

764
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,547
Yes, of course.
Barbara, isn't it?

765
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,549
- How are you?
- Well, actuall...

766
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,552
Barbara's very well, thank you, sir.
Very well indeed. How are you?

767
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,554
- Fine, thanks.
- Good.

768
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:50,183
Hello, Sam. Ida said you might be here.
Have you got a minute?

769
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:53,194
- Would you excuse us?
- Oh, no, of course.

770
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:55,924
Of course.
Come on, Alison... Barbara.

771
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,368
Sam.

772
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,506
I need your help.

773
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,022
Thanks very much, Sam.

774
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:31,759
Mr. Helpmann,
I'm glad to be of help.

775
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:35,429
- If I can help you...
- Ah, well, actually...

776
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,529
Oh.

777
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:43,010
Your father and I were very close.

778
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:47,446
Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me,
but we were close friends.

779
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,984
Especially after the bombing.

780
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:54,919
And I keep his name alive
at the office every day.

781
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:58,620
It's as though he's there
still speaking to me.

782
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:02,129
"'Ere I am.

783
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,825
J.H."

784
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,596
The ghost in the machine.

785
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:14,431
I know he would have
wanted me to help you.

786
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,879
And I promised your mother...

787
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:23,384
that I'd take you on to the team
at Information Retrieval.

788
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,818
But I gather that, um...

789
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:30,655
Well, actually, Mr. Helpmann, I've, uh...
I've changed my mind.

790
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,059
I've decided I'd accept the transfer...

791
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:36,131
if I'm not too late.

792
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,066
Too late?

793
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:41,227
That's for me to say.

794
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,805
Well... Well, then, I, uh...

795
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:49,144
Welcome to Information Retrieval.

796
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:24,680
Uh, my name's Lowry.

797
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:27,839
Sam Lowry.

798
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:31,351
I've been told to report
to Mr. Warrenn.

799
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:33,581
<i>Thirtieth floor, sir.</i>

800
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:35,657
<i>You're expected.</i>

801
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:41,228
Um, don't you want to search me?

802
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:43,298
<i>No, sir.</i>

803
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,195
<i>- Want to see my I.D.?
- No need, sir.</i>

804
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:52,636
<i>- But I could be anybody.
- No, you couldn't, sir.</i>

805
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,643
<i>This is Information Retrieval.</i>

806
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:58,873
<i>The lift's arrived, sir.</i>

807
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:24,755
I want that order rescinded!

808
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:48,180
<i>Half as terrorists, the rest as victims.</i>

809
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,951
Yes. No.

810
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,788
Definitely no!

811
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:54,590
- My name's Lowry, Mr. Warrenn. Sam Lowry.
- Ah, Lowry!

812
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:59,191
Yes. No. Cancel that. Okay.

813
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,735
- Glad to have you aboard. Yes.
- These requisitions...

814
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:04,863
- Sir, I'd like to point this out...
- No! Don't be ridiculous, Jenkins.

815
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,465
- About these invoices...
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

816
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:09,737
You'll like it up here.
Send that back.

817
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:13,008
We've got a crack team of...
Are they kidding? Decision makers.

818
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:15,015
No, in triplicate.

819
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:17,585
I'm expecting big things...
Two copies to Financial!

820
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:21,588
No. No.
Don't let Progress see those.

821
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:25,285
Between you and me, Lowry, this... No, no!
Department... Tell Records to get stuffed!

822
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:27,294
Is about to be upgraded and...

823
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:31,162
Ah! Here we are.

824
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:34,498
<i>Your very own number
on your very own door.</i>

825
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:37,504
And behind that door,
your very own office.

826
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:40,507
Congratulations, DZ/015.

827
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:42,634
Welcome to the team.

828
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:45,111
Yes! No! Cancel that!

829
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:47,478
<i>Send two copies to Financial.!</i>

830
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:23,377
Well, you can't borrow any more chairs!

831
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:26,039
There's only one left in here now,
and I need that to sit on!

832
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,740
What?

833
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,875
Oh.

834
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:32,545
Sorry.

835
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:34,714
Who are you?

836
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:37,223
My name's Lowry.
Sam Lowry.

837
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:40,625
Oh, yes.
The new boy from next door.

838
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:44,565
My name's Lime.
Harvey Lime.

839
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,567
Welcome to Expediting.

840
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:49,570
I say, look, would you mind
if I borrowed your computer console?

841
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:52,573
- What?
- Yes, I'll let you have it back in 10 minutes.

842
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:56,270
You want to take my console
into your office?

843
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:58,278
Yes. Just for a few minutes.

844
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,405
I- I'll tell you what.

845
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,507
You tell me what you want...

846
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:04,779
and I'll do it for you.

847
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:07,185
I'm a bit of a whiz on that thing.

848
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:09,189
Um...

849
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,191
all right.

850
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:15,127
Uh, I need some information
on a woman named Layton.

851
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:17,198
A woman, eh?

852
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:19,597
- I see.
- Yes.

853
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:23,331
I know her age and distinguishing marks,
but I need an address or a place of work.

854
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:26,340
This your dream girl, is it?

855
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:28,603
What? Um...

856
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:30,770
Look, let me use your console.

857
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:32,779
You must be joking.

858
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:37,875
When there's a woman involved,
there's no stopping me.

859
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:39,954
Let's have that sheet.

860
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:50,899
Sod it! It's broken!

861
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,967
You haven't switched it on.

862
01:12:54,236 --> 01:12:56,204
Oh, yes.

863
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:01,675
Look, you're putting me off standing there.

864
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:05,804
- Why don't you go back to your office
and I'll give you a knock when I'm finished.
- Um...

865
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:08,246
Go on. I'm not going to elope with her.

866
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:11,720
All right.

867
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:49,552
Sam!

868
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:13,940
Sam.

869
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:17,652
Don't go.

870
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:21,779
Please.

871
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,596
Well?

872
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:38,104
Computers are my forte.

873
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,107
Let me see.

874
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:44,305
"Jillian Layton. Coloring: White.
Hair: Blonde. Eyes: Blue. Height: 5 foot 4.

875
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:47,075
Distinguishing marks:
Scar on left"...

876
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:49,082
Is this all you've got?

877
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:53,086
Best to take things slowly
where some women are concerned.

878
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:55,156
Let me see.

879
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:58,192
Hey! That's mine!

880
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:01,128
"Layton.

881
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:03,130
"Truck driver.

882
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:07,828
All inquiries, reference office
of 412/L, room 5001."

883
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:13,432
Ah, Lowry, glad I caught you.
No! Send that back!

884
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:16,067
<i>- Mr. Warrenn.!
- Are you settling down?
I want this order rescinded.</i>

885
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,578
There's a query about a personnel transporter
you took out from the pool.

886
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,580
Tell them no.
Tell them yes.

887
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:23,242
Or was it a personnel carrier
you took out from Transportation?

888
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,253
Send that up to Security.
Anyway, tidy it up, Lowry.

889
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,255
There's a good chap.
And get a new suit.

890
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,257
Don't you want the lift?

891
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:50,902
Can I help you?

892
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:54,498
<i>No.! No.! No.! Please.!</i>

893
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:58,444
I'm, uh... I'm looking for Officer 412/L.

894
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:01,015
He won't be very long now.

895
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:05,577
I thought so.

896
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:15,155
You may go in now.

897
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:20,793
Oh, uh, not that one.

898
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:23,769
<i>That one. Yes.</i>

899
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:34,481
Excuse me.
Are you Officer 412/L?

900
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:42,857
Excuse me!

901
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:45,887
Jack.

902
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,985
Sam.

903
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:50,860
Ah! I heard you were coming aboard.

904
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:54,993
Congratulations, "DZ/015."

905
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:57,128
Thanks.
Are you Officer 412/L?

906
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,639
Uh-huh. That's me.

907
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:03,040
Oh, and, Sam,
a very happy Christmas.

908
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:05,045
- Thanks, Jack.
- Are you settling in all right?

909
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:08,480
Yes, fine. Jack, I...
I need some information.

910
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:11,643
Oh, Sam, this is Information Retrieval,
not Information Dispersal.

911
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:13,653
Hey! Amy!

912
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:15,655
Don't throw the ball around in here.

913
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:17,657
I'm not Amy. I'm Holly.

914
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:19,784
Did I call you Amy, darling?
I'm sorry.

915
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,829
- A triplet?
- One of them, I think.

916
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:24,797
Barbara's taken the other two
Christmas shopping.

917
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,801
You're not going to keep
calling her Barbara, are you?

918
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:30,599
Why ever not?
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?

919
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,231
Don't you like it?

920
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:35,434
Yes, it's... fine.

921
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:38,513
Come on.
Let's get these together.

922
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:41,309
<i>- Jack.
- Now bring me the blue one over there.</i>

923
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,316
I need to find out about a woman.

924
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:47,445
Come on, Chloe, let's show Uncle Sam here
how we can make the word "cat." Shall we?

925
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,116
- I'm Holly.
- Sorry, love. So you are.

926
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:52,193
- Cat.
- This is her.

927
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:55,362
Layton.

928
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:57,432
Oh, shit.

929
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:01,128
- How much do you know about this?
- Uh, not much.

930
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,670
What does B58/732 mean to you?

931
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:06,673
- Buttle.
- I knew it.

932
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:09,938
You always were bloody quick, Sam.

933
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:13,412
Who else knows?
Warrenn? Helpmann?

934
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,745
I don't know.
I only know you got the wrong man.

935
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,752
Information Transit got the wrong man.

936
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:20,754
<i>I got the right man.</i>

937
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:23,256
The wrong man was delivered to me
as the right man.

938
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:26,759
I accepted him on good faith
as the right man. Was I wrong?

939
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:28,762
You killed Buttle?

940
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:34,427
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down
to prevent such things happening.

941
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:37,903
It wasn't my fault that Buttle's heart condition
didn't appear on Tuttle's file.

942
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:39,906
Come and look.
How you getting on?

943
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:42,977
<i>- Jack.
- A, B, C...</i>

944
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:45,308
- I really need to know about...
- Tuttle?

945
01:19:45,413 --> 01:19:48,075
Well, we're gonna have to bring
Mr. Tuttle in, aren't we?

946
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:51,084
And interrogate him
at the same voltage as Mr. Buttle.

947
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:53,086
And juggle the books
in Electrical Banking.

948
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:57,284
- What has Tuttle done?
- We suspect him of, uh, freelance subversion.

949
01:19:57,392 --> 01:19:59,360
A freelance subversive.

950
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,396
Then all I need to wrap up the case
is the Layton woman.

951
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:04,397
What has she done?

952
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:07,263
Well, she witnessed the Tuttle...
Um, the Buttle arrest.

953
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:09,735
Since then, she's been going around
making wild allegations...

954
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:12,272
obviously trying to exploit the situation.

955
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:14,638
She's working for someone,
and I don't think it's us.

956
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:17,439
<i>- That's it. Over there, love.
- Terrorist?</i>

957
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:22,111
Mr. Lint, the next customer has been delivered.

958
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:25,380
- Thank you, Myrtle.
- What are you gonna do
about the Layton woman?

959
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:29,389
Well, I put her on the detention list.
Security should have her here before 6:00.

960
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:34,491
<i>What, here? So that she can
spill the beans inside the department?</i>

961
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:36,587
Don't do that!

962
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:40,065
Jack, why don't I
try and get to her for you?

963
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:43,137
I'll, um... I'll deactivate her.

964
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:46,833
What does that mean, Sam? I don't want
to get involved in anything unsavory.

965
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:48,569
Trust me, Jack.

966
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:53,171
- Come on, darling. Put these away now.
Mummy'll be here soon.
- Let me have her file.

967
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:57,685
Look, trust me, Jack.

968
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:01,921
All right.
Come on here.

969
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:06,016
All right, but for Christ's sake,
don't lose it.

970
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:08,652
All right.

971
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:10,958
<i>You sit down there, Mary.
Sam.</i>

972
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:13,034
Don't worry.
I'll get to her.

973
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:15,432
You'll never get anywhere
in a suit like that.

974
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:18,900
Here.

975
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:22,171
Try this.

976
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:24,677
- Bye-bye.
- Bye!

977
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:29,045
Uh, but, Jack, I...

978
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:33,314
Put it on, big boy.
I won't look at your willy.

979
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:47,023
Oh, let him go.

980
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:58,044
Trier, isn't he?

981
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:36,977
Just... I've been to
the department of...

982
01:22:56,037 --> 01:23:00,030
But you've stamped this form before.
Why won't you stamp it now?

983
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:03,633
You just said yourself, miss...
we've already stamped it.

984
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:15,788
No, no! Stop!

985
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:18,791
Up! Up! Up! Up! Up!

986
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:23,363
Oh, God.

987
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,433
Come on!

988
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:29,894
Shit!

989
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:47,186
<i>Oi.!
Come out of there.</i>

990
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:50,155
- What?
- That's the deputy minister's lift.

991
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:53,318
- I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry.
- Oi, come here.

992
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:56,329
Come here, sonny.
Let's see your I.D. Card, eh?

993
01:23:56,431 --> 01:23:59,832
My I.D.? Oh, God.

994
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:01,834
This isn't my suit.

995
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:06,305
<i>My name is Lowry. Sam Lowry.
Look, really, can't this wait?</i>

996
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:10,708
No, sir. I'm going to have to
fill in a report on this.

997
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:13,713
Now, then, uh,
what is the date today?

998
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:16,113
It's the...
Oh, God, it'll have to wait!

999
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:19,209
Oi! Oi, you! Stop!
Come back here! Stop!

1000
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:45,342
Aim!

1001
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:51,484
Stop! Don't...

1002
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:53,486
Up!

1003
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:08,434
Well done, men.
Quick thinking.

1004
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:10,436
Excellent work.

1005
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:14,440
Um...
I'll take charge of her now.

1006
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:16,442
Good. Good man.

1007
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:18,944
Um, okay.

1008
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:22,414
Uh... It's a...

1009
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:25,346
classified matter...

1010
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:27,819
and, um, I'll, uh...

1011
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:31,983
I'll include your fine handling
of the situation in my report.

1012
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:34,061
Great.

1013
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:38,196
Uh, merry Christmas, Dawson.

1014
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:42,201
Come along with me, please.
Please? Okay. Yes.

1015
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:44,635
Well done, men. Excellent.

1016
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:47,367
Good turnout. Nice.
Very good. Thank you.

1017
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:52,272
No, no, no. This way, please.
Straight ahead.

1018
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:02,088
This way. This way.

1019
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,556
This way.

1020
01:26:07,529 --> 01:26:09,429
Just keep moving.

1021
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:11,465
<i>- Hey.! Stop.!
- What?</i>

1022
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,631
Come back here!

1023
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:16,431
Pick up all these things!

1024
01:26:16,538 --> 01:26:19,632
<i>- Come on.! Pick them up.!
- Geez... Oh...</i>

1025
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:22,335
<i>Disgraceful.!</i>

1026
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:24,468
- Can't you read English?
- Ow! Get your bloody...

1027
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:29,346
You illiterate foreign pig!
You come over here on your own...

1028
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:34,683
...and think you can
mess up our streets!

1029
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:37,155
Oh, God.

1030
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:40,693
Stop!

1031
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:54,204
That's it! Let's go!
Vroom! Vroom!

1032
01:26:58,246 --> 01:27:01,545
What are you doing?
For Christ's sake, keep moving!

1033
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:05,544
- Get out of my cab.
- What?

1034
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:07,621
Just drive!

1035
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:10,823
You touched me.
Nobody touches me.

1036
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:13,120
What are you... Oh, God!

1037
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:15,128
Please! Please! Drive on!

1038
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,131
Drive on, will you! For...
Oh, shit. Move over. I'll drive.

1039
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:21,498
Don't touch that! Don't touch anything!

1040
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:28,372
It's okay, Officer. Thank you. It's okay.
Got everything under control. Thank you.

1041
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:30,706
Oh, shit. They're coming.

1042
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:34,873
Listen, please drive. Drive.
Trust me. You are in terrible danger.

1043
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:37,144
<i>You are an embarrassment.
Please.</i>

1044
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,243
Please drive.
Trust me. Trust me.

1045
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:41,618
<i>Drive, and I'll explain everything.</i>

1046
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:43,623
Please...

1047
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:45,716
get out of my cab.

1048
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:49,361
- I'm sorry. I...
- Okay!

1049
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:51,364
Okay, you've asked for it!

1050
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:53,730
I'm Information Retrieval Officer D...

1051
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:55,735
DZ/105!

1052
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:58,067
And I'm arresting you as a...

1053
01:27:58,172 --> 01:28:01,300
Drive on, or I'll blast
your fucking head off!

1054
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:05,813
Go!

1055
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:26,765
Look, I'm, uh... I'm sorry about that.

1056
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:29,098
I mean, uh, touching you
without permission.

1057
01:28:29,203 --> 01:28:31,763
But, um... Hello.

1058
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:34,467
My name is Lowry.
Sam Lowry.

1059
01:28:34,575 --> 01:28:36,770
I... I'm... I've been, uh...

1060
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:44,784
You won't believe this,
and I know it's going to sound incredible...

1061
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:47,980
but, um... but I've been
dreaming about you.

1062
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:51,651
No, not like that. I mean, I love you.

1063
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:55,260
In my dreams I love you.

1064
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:59,322
And, uh...
I mean... Extraordinary, isn't it?

1065
01:29:04,038 --> 01:29:06,598
Anyway, um...

1066
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,608
<i>y- y-you...</i>

1067
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:13,442
You don't believe me, do you?

1068
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:15,448
You, um...

1069
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:20,010
You probably think I-I-I-I'm bonkers, right?
Mad. Raving.

1070
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:25,455
No! No, I think
you're very attractive.

1071
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:27,994
What?

1072
01:29:29,097 --> 01:29:32,191
Yeah. Yeah, sit back.
Let me have a look at you.

1073
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:42,338
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1074
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:45,844
Good-looking, sexy.
Just my type.

1075
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:50,377
I don't believe you.

1076
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:52,043
Why not?

1077
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:55,987
Well, I-I... I just don't deserve
such terrific luck.

1078
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,121
Damn right.

1079
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:26,218
Help!

1080
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:04,356
I love...

1081
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:48,327
You don't trust me, do you?

1082
01:31:48,436 --> 01:31:51,735
Oh!

1083
01:32:22,904 --> 01:32:25,805
Oh, my God.
We shouldn't have come here.

1084
01:32:25,907 --> 01:32:28,307
I got a job to do!

1085
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:31,810
- But they'll be lying in wait.
- Oh, Christ, you're paranoid.

1086
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:34,313
You've got no sense of reality.

1087
01:32:34,415 --> 01:32:36,713
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

1088
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:42,553
We should take the lorry
and get away!

1089
01:32:42,657 --> 01:32:45,558
- Yeah? Where to?
- Anywhere, as fast as possible.

1090
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:48,561
- There isn't anywhere!
- Just far away!

1091
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:50,563
That's not far enough!

1092
01:32:50,665 --> 01:32:52,633
But... Wait!

1093
01:33:06,814 --> 01:33:08,714
Jill!

1094
01:34:02,203 --> 01:34:04,330
What's in the, uh, parcel?

1095
01:34:05,573 --> 01:34:07,734
- Christmas present.
- Oh.

1096
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:17,778
It's heavy.

1097
01:34:17,885 --> 01:34:20,012
Heavy Christmas present.

1098
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:22,282
- You don't trust me, open it.
- No!

1099
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:24,915
No, no, it's, uh... it's fine.

1100
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,424
I'd spoil the wrapping.

1101
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:32,397
Anyway, if I want you to trust me,
then it's only fair that I should trust you. Right?

1102
01:34:40,274 --> 01:34:44,040
Doesn't it bother you, the sort of things
you do at Information Retrieval?

1103
01:34:44,145 --> 01:34:46,113
What?

1104
01:34:47,248 --> 01:34:49,808
I suppose you'd rather
have terrorists.

1105
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:52,647
Here's one now.

1106
01:34:53,988 --> 01:34:58,254
How many terrorists have you met, Sam?
Actual terrorists?

1107
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:02,529
- Actual terrorists?
- Yeah.

1108
01:35:06,267 --> 01:35:08,861
Well...
It's only my first day.

1109
01:35:20,981 --> 01:35:23,950
- Uh-oh.
- A roadblock.

1110
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:28,012
- What are we gonna do?
- Stay calm.

1111
01:35:28,122 --> 01:35:30,022
Don't slow down.
Don't slow down!

1112
01:35:30,124 --> 01:35:32,786
Don't stop. Please.
Please do as I say. Go.

1113
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:35,054
Go! Straight ahead! Go!

1114
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:38,859
- Go! Go! Go!
- What are you doing, you stupid asshole?

1115
01:35:43,771 --> 01:35:45,238
Whoo!

1116
01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:53,345
We did it! We did it!

1117
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:56,883
We broke right through!
We did it! Whee, whee, whee, whee!

1118
01:36:02,323 --> 01:36:05,224
- Faster! Don't let them see you! Just go!
- Get off of me!

1119
01:36:08,162 --> 01:36:11,063
Keep going! Keep going! Faster!

1120
01:36:11,165 --> 01:36:14,601
- Get your foot down on it! Move!
- Stay off of it!

1121
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:23,375
No!

1122
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:30,583
Get off!

1123
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:41,726
Shit!

1124
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:44,925
Oh, no.

1125
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:49,897
Faster! Faster!

1126
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:59,209
- What if we lose the house, yeah?
- Don't touch anything!

1127
01:37:00,414 --> 01:37:03,008
Don't touch it!

1128
01:37:24,872 --> 01:37:29,775
We did it! We did it!
We did it! We did it!

1129
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:38,051
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1130
01:37:51,899 --> 01:37:54,527
And what would you like for Christmas?

1131
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:57,001
My own credit card.

1132
01:38:01,442 --> 01:38:03,410
Hmm.

1133
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:09,778
- Why have we come here?
- Go away!

1134
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:13,285
- Look, why don't we go back to my flat.
- Forget it.

1135
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:15,787
- You don't trust me?
- Trust you? Trust you?

1136
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:18,120
A man who hijacks my truck,
loses me my job...

1137
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:20,056
has every security man in town
looking for me?

1138
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,128
- Of course I trust you.
- I was only trying to help.

1139
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:24,129
- Yeah!
- Okay. Okay.

1140
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:26,131
You don't trust me, I don't trust you.

1141
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:28,133
- What's in that parcel?
- Oh, Jesus.

1142
01:38:28,235 --> 01:38:31,033
You saved it from the lorry.
It must be something very special.

1143
01:38:31,138 --> 01:38:34,039
I saved you from the lorry.
You're not something "very special."

1144
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:36,541
- How can you... I'm gonna open it.
- Don't touch that!

1145
01:38:45,786 --> 01:38:49,244
Sam! It's me!

1146
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:51,324
<i>And Shirley.!</i>

1147
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:55,428
Mrs. Terrain.

1148
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:01,059
<i>- That should hold it.
- Sam?</i>

1149
01:39:01,168 --> 01:39:03,693
Hello, Shirley.

1150
01:39:06,106 --> 01:39:08,370
<i>My God, what on earth's
happened to you now?</i>

1151
01:39:08,475 --> 01:39:12,206
My complication
had a little complication.

1152
01:39:12,313 --> 01:39:16,272
<i>But Dr. Chapman
says I'll soon be up...</i>

1153
01:39:16,383 --> 01:39:19,716
<i>and bounding about
like a young gazelle.</i>

1154
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:22,414
You buying a Christmas present
for your mother?

1155
01:39:22,523 --> 01:39:24,423
What?

1156
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:27,392
Oh, um, yes.
A little something.

1157
01:39:27,494 --> 01:39:31,089
Shirley and I come here
"wegularlarly."

1158
01:39:32,166 --> 01:39:34,259
We love romantic lingerie.

1159
01:39:34,368 --> 01:39:36,598
Really?

1160
01:39:36,704 --> 01:39:40,800
Sam, picture me in these.

1161
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:48,947
- Oh, my God.
- Sam, where are you going?

1162
01:39:49,049 --> 01:39:52,917
Sam! Sam!

1163
01:40:01,595 --> 01:40:03,460
Jill?

1164
01:40:06,867 --> 01:40:08,835
Jill!

1165
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:26,752
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

1166
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:33,259
Well, you don't deserve to be!

1167
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:36,386
What a bloody stupid thing!

1168
01:40:36,497 --> 01:40:39,830
How could you?
Look at these people! My God!

1169
01:40:39,933 --> 01:40:42,697
<i>It was a bomb.
It was a bomb.</i>

1170
01:40:42,803 --> 01:40:45,704
I should have opened it.
I sat there with it next... I...

1171
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:47,797
<i>What a stupid thing.</i>

1172
01:40:47,908 --> 01:40:49,842
There's your bomb, asshole!

1173
01:40:53,814 --> 01:40:55,714
Bribes...

1174
01:40:55,816 --> 01:40:57,875
for official monkeys like you.

1175
01:40:57,985 --> 01:41:00,385
Oh.

1176
01:41:01,789 --> 01:41:04,383
Go on.
Make yourself useful.

1177
01:41:08,328 --> 01:41:11,525
Here.

1178
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:18,505
Don't touch her! She's hurt!

1179
01:41:18,605 --> 01:41:21,802
Damn it!

1180
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:24,537
<i>- Don't touch her!
- No.!</i>

1181
01:41:27,815 --> 01:41:29,646
Stop!

1182
01:41:36,957 --> 01:41:39,391
Sam, no! Sam! Behind you!

1183
01:41:52,139 --> 01:41:55,040
These helmets don't half
make your scalp itch.

1184
01:41:55,142 --> 01:41:58,669
Oh, don't mention it.
And they make you sweat.

1185
01:41:58,779 --> 01:42:01,680
<i>Half the time
I can't ever see where I'm going.</i>

1186
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:05,411
<i>There's a great Niagara
of perspiration coming down.</i>

1187
01:42:05,519 --> 01:42:07,419
Well, I'm lucky.

1188
01:42:07,521 --> 01:42:09,421
I got these thick eyebrows.

1189
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:13,015
That keeps it up
and channels it out to the ears.

1190
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:15,027
<i>Yeah. Who's he?</i>

1191
01:42:15,129 --> 01:42:18,064
<i>Oh, I don't know.
Somebody from Information Retrieval.</i>

1192
01:42:18,165 --> 01:42:20,531
They're always hangin' around
in Lingerie.

1193
01:42:20,634 --> 01:42:24,126
<i>Where is she? Huh?</i>

1194
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:26,206
Jill, is that you?

1195
01:42:26,306 --> 01:42:30,606
Uh... Excuse me, sir.
That is government property.

1196
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:33,875
Oh, Jill.

1197
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:38,011
Jill! Answer me!

1198
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:42,311
I'm looking for a girl
with blonde hair.

1199
01:42:42,422 --> 01:42:45,050
She's medium height, green eyes.

1200
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:48,526
I don't know, sir.
They check all that at the depot.

1201
01:42:48,629 --> 01:42:52,224
Uh, we can't allow that, sir.
It's more than our job's worth.

1202
01:42:52,332 --> 01:42:55,233
Jill!
Jill, you must be here! Jill!

1203
01:42:55,335 --> 01:42:58,668
Look, sir, you can fill in an application form,
sir, if you're a relative.

1204
01:42:58,772 --> 01:43:00,672
Now, do stop, sir. Please.

1205
01:43:00,774 --> 01:43:03,004
Jill? Jill?

1206
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:05,010
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

1207
01:43:08,649 --> 01:43:12,278
Sorry about that, sir.
Regulations.

1208
01:43:18,058 --> 01:43:20,925
<i>This is a black eye
for the department, Lowry.</i>

1209
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:23,258
I don't care how you behaved
when you were at Records.

1210
01:43:23,363 --> 01:43:26,093
Information Retrieval
is an executive branch.

1211
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,998
We're proud of our reputation
and we protect it.

1212
01:43:29,102 --> 01:43:33,004
Damn it, Lowry! That convoy of personnel
carriers is still not accounted for!

1213
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:36,041
I thought I told you to deal with it.
And what the hell is this mess?

1214
01:43:36,143 --> 01:43:38,270
An empty desk is an efficient desk.

1215
01:43:38,378 --> 01:43:41,142
Good God.
Queries from Security.

1216
01:43:41,248 --> 01:43:43,409
Searches from Central Banking
about a check?

1217
01:43:43,517 --> 01:43:46,384
Clarification notices from Accounting
concerning unreturned receipts?

1218
01:43:46,486 --> 01:43:49,978
- Mr. Warrenn, I have to find out about...
- Get up!

1219
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:53,457
I don't know what's going on here, Lowry.

1220
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:58,725
But don't think you can intimidate us
with your friends and relatives in high places.

1221
01:43:58,832 --> 01:44:01,995
Now shape up!

1222
01:44:04,471 --> 01:44:07,372
Lime, I have to use your computer.

1223
01:44:07,474 --> 01:44:09,874
Sorry.
A bit busy at the moment.

1224
01:44:09,977 --> 01:44:12,946
You seem to have rather a lot
to get on with yourself.

1225
01:44:18,485 --> 01:44:21,648
Shit.

1226
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:24,890
Come off it, Jack.

1227
01:44:24,992 --> 01:44:27,893
Of course you can check
to see if she's been arrested.

1228
01:44:27,995 --> 01:44:32,898
I'm sorry, Sam. I'm afraid this case has become
much more complicated since last we... talked.

1229
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,060
But she's innocent, Jack.
She's done nothing wrong.

1230
01:44:36,169 --> 01:44:39,070
Tell that to the wives of the security men
she blew up this afternoon.

1231
01:44:39,172 --> 01:44:41,732
She's not alone in all this.

1232
01:44:41,842 --> 01:44:44,902
We've just had a report in that Tuttle
has wrecked an entire flat...

1233
01:44:45,012 --> 01:44:47,412
and sabotaged
adjacent Central Services.

1234
01:44:47,514 --> 01:44:50,415
As a matter of fact,
it looks like on your block.

1235
01:44:50,517 --> 01:44:53,748
I should keep my eyes open
if I were you, Sam. Bye.

1236
01:44:54,855 --> 01:44:58,018
But, Jack, you don't really think Tuttle
and the girl are in league, do you?

1237
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,524
I do.

1238
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:01,719
Everything's connected
all along the line.

1239
01:45:01,828 --> 01:45:04,160
Cause and effect.
That's the beauty of it.

1240
01:45:04,264 --> 01:45:07,495
Our job is to trace the connections
and, uh, reveal them.

1241
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:12,571
This whole Buttle-Tuttle confusion
was obviously planned from the inside.

1242
01:45:12,673 --> 01:45:14,573
Bye-bye.

1243
01:45:14,675 --> 01:45:16,905
Oh, but, Jack!

1244
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:19,570
She's innocent, Jack.

1245
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:22,581
Sam, we've always been close,
haven't we?

1246
01:45:22,683 --> 01:45:24,583
Yes, Jack?

1247
01:45:24,685 --> 01:45:28,143
Well, until this all blows over
just stay away from me.

1248
01:45:29,256 --> 01:45:31,224
But...

1249
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:35,505
Oh, my God.

1250
01:47:38,185 --> 01:47:39,743
<i>You.</i>

1251
01:47:40,987 --> 01:47:43,922
It's you.
What's happening?

1252
01:47:44,024 --> 01:47:46,117
What's happening?

1253
01:47:46,226 --> 01:47:48,126
Your thermostat's gone,
and then some.

1254
01:47:48,228 --> 01:47:50,128
And then some!

1255
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:52,130
What's happened to my flat?

1256
01:47:52,232 --> 01:47:55,690
Hello? What?
It's for you.

1257
01:47:55,802 --> 01:47:58,737
<i>- But as you don't live here anymore...
- What?</i>

1258
01:47:58,839 --> 01:48:02,605
Absolutely.
Do you know what this is?

1259
01:48:02,709 --> 01:48:04,836
This is an H2206...

1260

authorizing the compulsory,
temporary requisitioning of this flat...

1262
01:48:11,551 --> 01:48:13,451
- Repairs!
- What?

1263
01:48:13,553 --> 01:48:15,953
- No! You...
- Don't forget your receipt.

1264
01:48:16,056 --> 01:48:19,082
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- No, sir. Don't forget your receipt.

1265
01:48:19,192 --> 01:48:22,252
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit
of a stickler for paperwork.

1266
01:48:22,362 --> 01:48:25,263
<i>He's a stickler for paperwork, sir.!</i>

1267

01:49:36,102 --> 01:49:38,570
- Jesus Christ!
- The smell! Stop!

Oh!

1277
01:49:58,692 --> 01:50:00,660
Shit!

1278
01:50:02,329 --> 01:50:04,229
We're all in it together, kid.

1279
01:50:16,543 --> 01:50:19,103
<i>Jill. Jill.!</i>

1280

Jill. Oh, God.

1281
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:27,109
Are you all right?
What happened to you after...

1282
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:30,053
Your face. Are you hurt?

1283
01:50:31,091 --> 01:50:32,991
Um, no, I-I'm fine.

1284
01:50:33,093 --> 01:50:36,529
It's... Well...

1285
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:39,155
I've been worried sick about you.

1286
01:50:53,046 --> 01:50:55,947
- Who was that?
- That's a friend of mine. He...

1287
01:50:56,049 --> 01:50:59,246
Oh, God. Holy shit.

1288
01:50:59,352 --> 01:51:03,379
We'd better get out of here quick.
Come on. Quietly.

1289
01:51:07,394 --> 01:51:09,362
Look out. Here. Take this.

1290
01:51:11,731 --> 01:51:13,699
Looks big.

1291
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:26,278
Here.

1292
01:51:28,014 --> 01:51:30,312
Quick. Quick.

1293
01:52:05,285 --> 01:52:08,743
- Are you sure this is all right?
- Yes. Yes, certain.

1294
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:12,317
My mother's away for Christmas.

1295
01:52:13,693 --> 01:52:16,161
She's spending it at the plastic surgeon's.

1296
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:21,726
The wraps come off tomorrow.

1297
01:53:02,175 --> 01:53:06,578
Lock the door after me.
Don't answer the phone to anyone.

1298
01:53:06,679 --> 01:53:08,943
I won't be long.

1299
01:53:10,183 --> 01:53:13,084
- Where are you going?
- I know a way to save you.

1300
01:53:13,186 --> 01:53:16,349
- Trust me. I can do it.
- But you can't go without me.

1301
01:53:52,058 --> 01:53:55,118
Excuse me, Dawson. Could you put me through
to Mr. Helpmann's office, please?

1302
01:53:55,228 --> 01:53:57,128
I'm afraid I can't, sir.

1303
01:53:57,230 --> 01:54:00,131
You have to go through the proper channels.

1304
01:54:00,233 --> 01:54:05,637
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are
because that's classified information.

1305
01:54:05,738 --> 01:54:11,142
I'm glad to see the ministry is continuing
its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.

1306
01:54:11,244 --> 01:54:13,212
Thank you, Dawson.

Think carefully before you decide.

1371
02:02:45,858 --> 02:02:48,588
Looking ahead in financial matters

1372
02:02:56,602 --> 02:03:00,197
Sam, what are we going to do with you?

1373
02:03:02,274 --> 02:03:04,242
Where is Jill?

1374
02:03:05,945 --> 02:03:08,004
I've got to find her.

1375
02:03:08,114 --> 02:03:11,345
Please. Please, you've got to
get me out of here.

1376
02:03:11,450 --> 02:03:14,977
I understand, Sam.
I know exactly how you feel.

1377
02:03:15,087 --> 02:03:18,579
So I've brought you

Oh, please help me.

1379
02:03:21,460 --> 02:03:24,861
I assure you, Sam,
I'm doing everything within my power.

1380
02:03:24,964 --> 02:03:27,899
But the rules of the game
are laid down.

1381
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,969
We all have to play by them.
Even me.

1382
02:03:32,138 --> 02:03:36,302
It's all a mistake.
You've got to understand that.

1383
02:03:36,409 --> 02:03:41,642
Yes, well, from the department's point of view,
you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but...

1384
02:03:41,747 --> 02:03:44,409
I'm not a terrorist.

1385
02:03:44,517 --> 02:03:47,418
You must know that.
Please, please get me out of here.

1386
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:50,978
Sam, information retrieval
is expensive.

1387
02:03:51,090 --> 02:03:54,025
You're running up an enormous bill
by not cooperating.

1388
02:03:54,126 --> 02:03:56,287
Please.

1389
02:03:56,395 --> 02:03:59,364

Yes.

1393
02:04:07,006 --> 02:04:10,237
Sam, I think I ought to tell you.

1394
02:04:10,342 --> 02:04:14,938
I'm afraid she's upped stumps
and retired to the pavilion.

02:04:16,782 --> 02:04:18,750
<i>Thrown in the towel.</i>

Yes.

1398
02:04:24,156 --> 02:04:27,125
It's all a bit confusing,
but it seems she was killed...

1399
02:04:27,226 --> 02:04:29,194
resisting arrest.

1400
02:04:32,231 --> 02:04:35,223
No. It's all right.

1401
02:04:35,334 --> 02:04:37,302
I did that.

1402
02:04:39,972 --> 02:04:42,873
The odd thing is,
it appears to have happened twice.

1403
02:04:42,975 --> 02:04:45,170
Bit of a disputed call, I'm afraid.

1404
02:04:47,780 --> 02:04:49,748
Twice?

1405
02:04:49,849 --> 02:04:51,749
So, there you are.

1406
02:04:51,851 --> 02:04:56,618
All I can say is, don't fall at the last fence,
the finishing post in sight.

1407
02:04:56,722 --> 02:04:58,622
See you in the paddock.

1408
02:04:58,724 --> 02:05:01,124
Do cooperate.
Think of your mother.

1409
02:05:01,227 --> 02:05:03,627
Good luck.
Keep your eye on the ball.

1410
02:05:03,729 --> 02:05:07,130
Gotta go.
Can't keep the orphans waiting.

1411
02:05:35,261 --> 02:05:37,354
Don't fight it, son.

1412
02:05:37,463 --> 02:05:39,522
Confess quickly.

1413
02:05:40,666 --> 02:05:43,829
If you hold out too long,
you could jeopardize your credit rating.

1414
02:05:55,748 --> 02:05:57,648
695/6.

1415
02:05:57,750 --> 02:06:00,480
Thank you.

1416
02:06:34,119 --> 02:06:36,383
Jack?

1417
02:06:41,594 --> 02:06:43,687
Jack.

1418
02:06:43,796 --> 02:06:45,889
Jack. Jack!

1419
02:06:45,998 --> 02:06:47,898
Shut up.

1420
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,197
Jack. Jack, I'm innocent.
Please.

1421
02:06:51,303 --> 02:06:53,567
- Help me.
- Bastard.

1422
02:06:54,807 --> 02:06:56,502
Jack.

1423
02:06:56,609 --> 02:06:59,305
Jack, this is all a mistake.
Please, Jack.

1424
02:06:59,411 --> 02:07:01,379
Take that mask off.

1425
02:07:06,552 --> 02:07:08,520
You stupid bastard.

1426
02:07:09,788 --> 02:07:12,222
- Jack.
- How could you do this to me?

1427
02:07:12,324 --> 02:07:14,224
Jack, I'm frightened.

1428
02:07:14,326 --> 02:07:16,556
How do you think I feel, you shit?

1429
02:07:16,662 --> 02:07:18,630
- Jack...
- Shut up!

1430
02:07:23,135 --> 02:07:27,469
This is a professional relationship.

1431
02:07:28,574 --> 02:07:30,474
Jack.

1432
02:07:30,576 --> 02:07:33,773
Jack, no, you can't.

1433
02:07:33,879 --> 02:07:36,439
No, Jack, please.

1434
02:07:36,548 --> 02:07:38,641
<i>Jack, no.! Don't.!</i>

1435
02:07:38,751 --> 02:07:41,219
<i>Please, Jack.! No.!</i>

1436
02:08:26,298 --> 02:08:29,290
- You okay?
- Tuttle!

1437
02:08:29,401 --> 02:08:31,369
Call me Harry.

1438
02:09:18,984 --> 02:09:21,282
Let's go!

1439
02:09:51,850 --> 02:09:53,283
Here. Here.

1440
02:14:30,529 --> 02:14:34,363
Ah, Mr. Lowry.
So pleased you could make it.

1441
02:14:34,466 --> 02:14:36,730
Right this way.

1442
02:14:41,239 --> 02:14:43,207
It's a sad loss.

1443
02:14:43,308 --> 02:14:46,004
<i>Your mother was with her at the end.</i>

1444
02:14:46,111 --> 02:14:50,343
The gift of eternal life.

1445
02:14:50,449 --> 02:14:55,580
Mrs. Terrain has just received
that most wonderful of gifts.

1446
02:14:55,687 --> 02:14:57,985
<i>She came to us physically new.</i>

1447
02:14:58,090 --> 02:15:02,151
<i>She goes hence from us
not so physically new.</i>

1448
02:15:02,260 --> 02:15:04,160
But the spirit never grows old.

1449
02:15:04,262 --> 02:15:07,356
Madame Lowry.

1450
02:15:11,703 --> 02:15:13,671
Mother.

1451
02:15:14,973 --> 02:15:16,873
Oh. Sam.

1452
02:15:16,975 --> 02:15:19,443
Mother. Mother!

1453
02:15:21,613 --> 02:15:23,843
Stop calling me that.

1454
02:15:24,883 --> 02:15:28,284
Mother! Mother, please!

1455
02:15:28,386 --> 02:15:31,753
- Is this guy bothering you?
- Oh. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

1456
02:15:31,857 --> 02:15:34,690
Mother!

1457
02:15:34,793 --> 02:15:38,854
Go away.
This is a very sacred moment.

1458
02:18:48,386 --> 02:18:50,547
He's got away from us, Jack.

1459
02:18:50,655 --> 02:18:52,953
Afraid you're right, Mr. Helpmann.

1460
02:18:53,058 --> 02:18:55,618
He's gone.

1461
02:18:58,263 --> 02:19:00,231
Well...

1462
02:19:31,996 --> 02:19:34,863
<i># Then #</i>

1463
02:19:34,966 --> 02:19:40,336
<i># Tomorrow was another day #</i>

1464
02:19:40,438 --> 02:19:44,738
<i># The morning found me miles away #</i>

1465
02:19:45,777 --> 02:19:51,079
<i># With still a million things to say #</i>

1466
02:19:53,518 --> 02:19:56,385
<i>#Now #</i>

1467
02:19:56,488 --> 02:20:00,584
<i>#As twilight gleams the sky above #</i>

1468
02:20:01,793 --> 02:20:06,059
<i>#Recalling thrills of our love #</i>

1469
02:20:07,399 --> 02:20:11,768
<i># There's one thing I'm certain of #</i>

1470
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:14,771
<i>#Return #</i>

1471
02:20:14,873 --> 02:20:17,671
<i>#I will #</i>

1472
02:20:17,776 --> 02:20:21,234
<i># To old #</i>

1473
02:20:21,346 --> 02:20:25,874
<i>#Brazil ##</i>
