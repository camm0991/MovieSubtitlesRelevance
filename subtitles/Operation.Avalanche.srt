1
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:22,710
<i>For we meet in an hour
of change and challenge,</i>

2
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:25,680
<i>in a decade of hope and fear,</i>

3
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:28,983
<i>in an age of both
knowledge and ignorance.</i>

4
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:34,122
<i>The greater our knowledge increases,
the greater our ignorance unfolds.</i>

5
00:01:34,124 --> 00:01:37,225
<i>So it is not surprising</i>

6
00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:41,162
<i>that some would have us stay
where we are a little longer.</i>

7
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:43,765
<i>To rest, to wait.</i>

8
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:47,735
<i>But this city of Houston,
this state of Texas,</i>

9
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:49,837
<i>this country of
the United States</i>

10
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:52,740
<i>was not built by those
who waited and rested</i>

11
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:54,676
<i>and wished to look behind them.</i>

12
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:01,683
<i>We choose to go to the moon.</i>

13
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:03,885
<i>We choose to go to the moon.</i>

14
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:14,128
<i>We choose to go to the moon in this
decade and do the other things,</i>

15
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,232
<i>not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.</i>

16
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:22,770
<i>With this one speech, John f.
Kennedy escalated our cold war</i>

17
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:25,840
<i>with the Soviet union
to outer space.</i>

18
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:29,310
<i>Now, if we do not land a man
on the moon by 1969,</i>

19
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:31,879
<i>we will have broken
JFK's promise.</i>

20
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:35,850
<i>And in the eyes of the world, the
Soviet union will win the cold war.</i>

21
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:37,785
<i>To make matters
even more difficult,</i>

22
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:39,387
<i>the CIA has discovered a leak</i>

23
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:41,823
<i>coming out of the space program.</i>

24
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:44,826
<i>Top secret American research is
showing up in Soviet briefings,</i>

25
00:02:44,828 --> 00:02:50,131
<i>which means the KGB has
implanted a mole inside NASA.</i>

26
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:54,969
<i>If the Russians are able to steal our
technology, they could beat us to the moon.</i>

27
00:02:54,971 --> 00:03:00,808
<i>Just as they beat us into space
with the sputnik satellite in 1957.</i>

28
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,045
<i>The director of NASA, James Webb,
denies the presence of this mole,</i>

29
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:07,515
<i>which means the CIA must
move in a team undercover.</i>

30
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:11,252
<i>That's where we come in.</i>

31
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:14,222
<i>Allow me to introduce
Owen Williams,</i>

32
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:17,091
<i>and myself, Matt Johnson.</i>

33
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:19,427
<i>We joined the CIA through
the bright recruits program</i>

34
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:22,864
<i>and have been working
together ever since.</i>

35
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:27,902
<i>Along with our camera team, we
make up the CIA's av department.</i>

36
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:31,005
<i>Currently, we are finishing
operation deep red.</i>

37
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:33,307
<i>The probe into film director
Stanley Kubrick.</i>

38
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:37,278
<i>But this mission is not using
us to our full potential.</i>

39
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,515
<i>We are asking to be transferred
off of operation deep red,</i>

40
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:43,017
<i>and on to operation zipper.</i>

41
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,386
<i>The mission into NASA
to find the mole.</i>

42
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:48,156
<i>Because of our filmmaking
background, we would make...</i>

43
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:49,524
Okay, stop.

44
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:51,392
Stop.

45
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:52,860
What is this supposed to be?

46
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:56,030
Okay. It's a...
It's a pitch film.

47
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,433
It... so... it's for operation zipper.
I think...

48
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:01,836
Operation zipper's already
been assigned.

49
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:03,137
We know it has.

50
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,139
I think the agency is
making a mistake

51
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:07,275
with sending
a scientist into NASA.

52
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:09,877
Well, your opinion
means nothing.

53
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,013
Yeah, okay.
Just... just...

54
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:14,081
If you watch the rest of this film,
you'll see... I've seen enough.

55
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:17,185
But we have an amazing plan for
finding the spy. I'm sure you do.

56
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:20,388
Boles, we worked hard on this. You're seriously
not going to watch the rest of this?

57
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,056
No. Can we show it to Brackett?

58
00:04:22,058 --> 00:04:23,157
No.

59
00:04:26,094 --> 00:04:28,963
Okay.

60
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:30,932
This was a long shot.

61
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:33,568
We've only been here
for one year.

62
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,070
We'll get on missions
like this in the future.

63
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:40,975
I thought this was
going to work.

64
00:04:40,977 --> 00:04:44,879
You knew that it wasn't a great chance.
Yeah, you should...

65
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:46,314
Jared, you should have cut when

66
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:47,849
you saw it wasn't going good.

67
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:49,584
You're supposed to be
filming so that...

68
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:52,420
I didn't even notice.

69
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,388
Yeah.
Hey.

70
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:01,462
Okay, I got an idea.

71
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:05,132
<i>We need to send someone who will look
like they have no idea what's going on.</i>

72
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:08,135
<i>Us, as a documentary film crew.</i>

73
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:11,372
We can pretend we are from the national
education... Okay, we have to go.

74
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:12,473
We got to go.

75
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:14,909
Is this a good idea?

76
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:17,311
Andy? It's a good... Hey.
It's a good idea.

77
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:20,214
Are you ready?
What if they fire us?

78
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:22,550
What's your first line?

79
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:26,287
Oh, uh, your plan is to send...
Okay, I'm fine.

80
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:29,223
Okay. Let's go.

81
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:41,402
Everyone here?

82
00:05:41,404 --> 00:05:43,070
Boles...

83
00:05:43,072 --> 00:05:44,972
Carry on.
Thank you.

84
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:46,941
Good morning, everyone.

85
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:55,416
<i>Hello, my name is special agent Matt
Johnson, and what you're about to watch</i>

86
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:58,152
<i>is a film detailing the connections
between Stanley Kubrick</i>

87
00:05:58,154 --> 00:06:02,089
<i>and the film</i> Dr. Strangelove or how I
learned to stop worrying and love the bomb.

88
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:05,059
<i>Conclusion,
Stanley Kubrick is not a spy.</i>

89
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:14,402
Thank you.

90
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:16,337
Are there any questions?

91
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,376
That covers it.
Uh, what's next?

92
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:26,547
Actually, director Brackett,
I'd like to make a pitch for

93
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:31,018
major research to be moved
onto operation zipper next.

94
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,187
What the hell are you doing?

95
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,426
You guys are trying to put a...

96
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:42,363
Field agent inside NASA
posing as a scientist, and...

97
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:45,633
Agent Williams and I
don't think it will work.

98
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:48,336
This mole, if he's there,

99
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:51,472
could have been at NASA
since the early 60s.

100
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:56,243
He's going to spot one of our guys pretending
to be a rocket scientist instantly.

101
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:58,245
We need to send people

102
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:00,982
who are going to look like they
have no idea what's going on.

103
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:02,249
Us.

104
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:04,285
As a documentary film crew.

105
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:07,021
We can pretend that we're from the
national education television network,

106
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:10,057
filming the definitive
Apollo documentary.

107
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:13,627
We're there to chart the race to the moon.
Smart idea.

108
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:17,999
But no Soviet mole's gonna
let anyone openly film 'em.

109
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:21,502
Well, director Brackett, we're filming
you right now through the window.

110
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:35,249
You're going to have to buy
us better cameras, though.

111
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:37,251
Jesus Christ.

112
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:56,097
Okay, here we go.

113
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:58,232
Let's hope they buy this.

114
00:08:58,234 --> 00:09:00,701
Ready?

115
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:03,604
Whoa!

116
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:05,506
- Hi!
- Hi!

117
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:07,108
Just let us get our stuff.

118
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,342
Yeah, yeah!

119
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:11,112
You need help, Andy?

120
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:12,746
Do you mind if we film this?

121
00:09:12,748 --> 00:09:14,482
Yeah, why not.

122
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:17,885
Here, at the end
of the hall on the right...

123
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:19,520
Oh, man.

124
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:21,489
That's mission control?

125
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:23,591
Yeah, actually. We'll have
to get in there later.

126
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:24,692
Hmm.

127
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:26,260
Hi.

128
00:09:26,262 --> 00:09:27,862
We're a documentary film crew.

129
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:29,797
We're a documentary film crew.

130
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:32,133
Jared, make sure you're getting
this crisp and in focus,

131
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:35,703
I don't want to have to edit
together out of focus stuff, please.

132
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:37,204
- Sorry.
- No problem.

133
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:38,606
Your office is just right here.

134
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:40,374
Okay, here you go.

135
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:43,911
Wow!

136
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:46,547
You guys don't need
anything else?

137
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:48,282
No, uh, we'll come find you if we do.
We'll just get set up.

138
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:49,717
Thanks, Sharon.

139
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,785
Bye!

140
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:54,221
She bought it. We're a
documentary film crew.

141
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:56,524
You see how they look at us? See
how they look in the cameras?

142
00:09:56,526 --> 00:09:58,592
Yeah.

143
00:09:58,594 --> 00:10:00,761
This is the best mission I've
ever been on in my life.

144
00:10:00,763 --> 00:10:02,530
This is, uh...
This is Matt.

145
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:04,632
Mike.
Nice to meet you.

146
00:10:04,634 --> 00:10:06,734
And, uh, this is Jared.

147
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:09,537
They're filming a documentary about
the, uh... The Apollo mission.

148
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:12,873
Oh, okay!

149
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,410
So, we basically are asking
about what you do, and... Sure!

150
00:10:16,412 --> 00:10:18,546
And... and I'm ready.
Yeah. Okay.

151
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,681
Well, I work here
in the public affairs office,

152
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:22,750
and one of my duties is

153
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:26,387
the media products,
specifically still photos.

154
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:34,828
And I stood up in the theater
in sugar land and I said,

155
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,632
"don't eat those meatballs!
He did not wash his hands."

156
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:39,767
I had to...

157
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,212
I appreciate your time. Before we launch
to the moon, come back and see us, okay?

158
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:52,713
I will.
Okay.

159
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:54,582
Thanks, guys. That's a wrap.
We got it.

160
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:56,650
All right, and mark it.

161
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:58,586
- Milt interview.
- Take one.

162
00:10:59,922 --> 00:11:01,956
Thanks, Owen.

163
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,558
So, I guess you can start
just by telling us your name.

164
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,427
Milt Heflin.

165
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:09,263
And what is it you do
here at NASA?

166
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:11,232
Huh. Uh...

167
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:13,801
Okay.

168
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:18,939
Shut the door.

169
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:34,622
Guys, can we get a shot of
just the lounge being busy?

170
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:36,890
I know you're all working,
but if you want to just...

171
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:39,860
Busy, like there's
some activity.

172
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:42,796
Or, do whatever feels natural.

173
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:45,032
And action.

174
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:48,802
No, don't look at the cameras. Just
keep sitting. Just keep standing there.

175
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:07,821
<i>Part of Sato's controversial
south-east Asia...</i>

176
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:09,990
<i>the north Vietnamese</i>

three tragic fires aboard aircraft...</i>

180
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,771
<i>One second, Mr. Webb.
We're good?</i>

181
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:26,307
<i>Mr. Webb, tell me,
what does it mean</i>

182
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:28,976
<i>when people say the Russians are
ahead of us in the space race?</i>

183
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:31,612
<i>Well, I think it means
that the job of</i>

184
00:12:31,614 --> 00:12:33,514
<i>landing something on the moon</i>

185
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:35,416
<i>where there's no atmosphere,</i>

186
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:37,484
<i>and using a rocket
to slow it up,</i>

187
00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:38,952
<i>and having the equipment
still work</i>

188
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:41,422
<i>is a very difficult job.</i>

189
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:44,725
<i>Uh, I think it means the Russians
are trying, just like we are...</i>

190
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:47,995
Where's this guy's office?

191
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:49,863
<i>But I think the real
meaning is...</i>

192
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:58,772
Two more pieces.

193
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:01,942
- Come on, Jared.
- Got it, got it!

194
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:03,877
Okay, hold on.

195
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,479
I'm fine, I need light.

196
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:15,723
Ready?

197
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:18,726
Test, test, test, test...

198
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:21,995
<i>then you get to talk about
how to go forward. To do it.</i>

199
00:13:21,997 --> 00:13:24,765
<i>Uh, I am not much interested,</i>

200
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:28,635
<i>and I don't think it's very realistic to
talk about technological interchange,</i>

201
00:13:28,637 --> 00:13:31,505
<i>and this kind of thing. You
first gotta get on the basis</i>

202
00:13:31,507 --> 00:13:32,673
<i>where... where...</i>

203
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:34,141
Okay, so...

204
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,443
His phone rings, in his office,

205
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:38,479
and this phone rings
at the same time.

206
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:41,648
As long as we're rolling

207
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,718
when he picks up,
we get everything.

208
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,020
<i>I found us a house.
It's beautiful, it's red,</i>

209
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:49,590
<i>it has a nursery and a yard.
You'll love it.</i>

210
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:51,492
<i>How big is the bed?</i>

211
00:13:51,494 --> 00:13:52,726
<i>It's a queen.</i>

212
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:58,665
<i>Are you alone right now?</i>

213
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,135
<i>No, I'm at work.
What are you doing?</i>

214
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:03,771
<i>Do you want to know
what I'm wearing?</i>

215
00:14:03,773 --> 00:14:06,039
<i>Julie, I can't do this right now.
I'm at the office.</i>

216
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,742
<i>I'm sorry, maybe later.</i>

217
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:13,814
<i>Well, I'm wearing a pink bra and
that black skirt you bought me.</i>

218
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:17,584
<i>Honey, Matt is right beside me and
I'm at work. Can I call you tonight?</i>

219
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:19,953
<i>I'm taking off the skirt now.</i>

220
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:23,924
<i>There's nothing underneath.
Whoa!</i>

221
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:27,861
What are you doing?
Nothing.

222
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:30,531
<i>I'm trying to have fun with you.</i>

223
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,200
Wait a second, hold on... No!

224
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:35,002
<i>What is it?</i>

225
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:37,538
We're not doing anything.
I'm doing work.

226
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:40,808
<i>Hello?</i>

227
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,144
Don't do that.

228
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:47,214
What'd you find in that phone?

229
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:49,817
What? What?
Oh, my god.

230
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:52,019
We've been bugged.

231
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,954
We've been bugged, guys.
We've been bugged.

232
00:14:53,956 --> 00:14:55,155
No, no, no!

233
00:14:55,157 --> 00:14:57,858
Anything else,
or is that it? Owen?

234
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:00,994
That's it from this car?

235
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:03,797
Guys?

236
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:08,902
I said I was sorry!

237
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:10,637
Your hat?

238
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:24,551
- A couple more boxes here.
- These are not a big deal.

239
00:15:28,957 --> 00:15:32,759
Please don't touch me.

240
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:36,163
I'll get the rest!

241
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:10,731
<i>We both, uh, have had and
will have emergencies,</i>

242
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:14,935
<i>and, uh, that each flight, uh, has
some element of extreme risk,</i>

243
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:16,970
<i>and some elements of...</i>

244
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:19,239
<i>I made this statement on
my own, from my knowledge,</i>

245
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:22,709
<i>uh, longstanding knowledge...</i>

246
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,567
<i>setting us back four years...</i>

247
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:48,235
<i>Well...</i>

248
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:50,637
Uh...

249
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,106
<i>300 second burn
to the lunar surface...</i>

250
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:56,109
This is nothing.

251
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:57,811
Give it a second. <i>250
seconds is all we can do?</i>

252
00:16:57,813 --> 00:16:59,780
<i>That's the maximum.</i>

253
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:02,282
<i>- And you know that...
- Did you talk to TRW?</i>

254
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:04,985
- Who's the other voice?
- I dunno.

255
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:06,787
<i>Their fuels.</i>

256
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:08,355
<i>Grumman has fucked us.</i>

257
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:11,925
<i>They built a lander
that can't land.</i>

258
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:14,127
<i>So, we are going back...</i>

259
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:15,629
<i>With whom?</i>

260
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:17,631
<i>This is setting us
back four years.</i>

261
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:20,801
<i>Well, I agree. This is
going to have to change.</i>

262
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:22,903
<i>Change? We can't
land on the moon.</i>

263
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:25,939
<i>Unless by some miracle
Braun finds lighter fuel,</i>

264
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:28,141
<i>we aren't touching down
for five years.</i>

265
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:31,244
<i>Okay... We're just going to
be circling forever up there.</i>

266
00:17:31,246 --> 00:17:33,347
<i>So what are we telling everyone?</i>

267
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:35,082
<i>- Nothing.
- We don't tell anyone...</i>

268
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:38,385
Do you understand
what this means?

269
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:40,754
NASA can't do it.

270
00:17:40,756 --> 00:17:42,623
They can't land man
and come back.

271
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,057
Have you called Brackett?

272
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:46,093
Of course not! I needed
to tell you guys first.

273
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:47,995
We have to tell Brackett. We have
to tell Brackett right away.

274
00:17:47,997 --> 00:17:49,896
This is something you report right away.
We need help.

275
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:52,966
We have to...
Relax, it's okay. Yes. Yes.

276
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:54,334
And we need... I'll tell
you what to do, okay?

277
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,036
I'm gonna tell you what to do.

278
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:57,971
Find out who that other guy on
the phone was, okay?

279
00:17:57,973 --> 00:18:00,040
Because, if we found
this out in a month,

280
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,676
you better fucking believe that
the mole can do the same thing.

281
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:04,745
And now all of a sudden the Russians
know we can't make it to the moon,

282
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:06,313
then what the fuck are
we going to do?

283
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:08,315
Okay. Okay. Okay.

284
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:11,118
You call Langley.

285
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,786
It's ringing.

286
00:18:14,723 --> 00:18:18,158
You think I'll get to talk
to the president? No.

287
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,327
That's not unrealistic.

288
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:22,029
I could. He could be like, "we need
to get this right to the president."

289
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:23,830
I'll be like, "all right.

290
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:25,312
"Give me his
home phone, sir. I'll..."

291
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:28,835
<i>Hello?</i>

292
00:18:28,837 --> 00:18:30,237
Director Brackett, it's agent
Johnson calling from Houston.

293
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,672
We have big news.

294
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:33,373
<i>What's that?</i>

295
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,709
They can't make it to the moon.

296
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:37,277
We intercepted a call

297
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,780
from Jim Webb.

298
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:42,315
From what I understand,
they can circle the moon,

299
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:44,117
but they can't actually land.

300
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:46,286
They... they don't have
the technology to do it.

301
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:48,722
They're saying 1971
at the earliest.

302
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:51,425
<i>Damn it.</i>

303
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:54,895
<i>Give me a minute.</i>

304
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:57,064
<i>Okay, who else knows about this?</i>

305
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:59,099
Uh, nobody, from...
From...

306
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:00,400
From what we can tell.

307
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:02,736
They're talking about it
on the phone

308
00:19:02,738 --> 00:19:05,472
like it was a big secret. Like they've
never talked about it before.

309
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:07,841
<i>Okay, good.</i>

310
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:10,010
<i>Another unit is going
to take over zipper.</i>

311
00:19:10,012 --> 00:19:11,745
<i>Get your team out of there.</i>

312
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:15,282
Uh... you think maybe
that's a bit, uh,

313
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:17,284
shortsighted in a way?

314
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:20,020
Seeing as we're here undercover now?
What... why?

315
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:22,956
<i>Don't question my orders, kid.</i>

316
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,958
I'm not... I don't mean
to question it. I...

317
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,228
I just... I simply think
that we're here

318
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,798
and I... We have to figure
out a response to this,

319
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,234
somehow, and you've got us...

320
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:40,474
We're going home.

321
00:21:47,368 --> 00:21:50,637
If either of us are talking, shoot. I
don't care how much film you burn,

322
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:52,472
it doesn't matter.
Okay? It's going to save us.

323
00:21:52,474 --> 00:21:53,940
What are we doing in here?

324
00:21:53,942 --> 00:21:55,308
Sit down, just listen
to this, okay?

325
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,143
Well...

326
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:59,946
Hold on a sec... Did you
call Brackett last night?

327
00:21:59,948 --> 00:22:01,481
Yes, all right?
What did he say?

328
00:22:01,483 --> 00:22:03,516
Okay, turn this on.

329
00:22:03,518 --> 00:22:05,886
What did they say?

330
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:08,221
I'm gonna tell you
what they said.

331
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,125
Okay, it's on.

332
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:14,995
Okay, you hear that?

333
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:18,531
Yeah.

334
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:21,668
- You recognize it?
- Yeah.

335
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,403
It's sputnik.

336
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:25,071
You know what?
You're ahead of me.

337
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:26,406
Okay, yeah.
It's sputnik.

338
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:28,341
How do you know it's sputnik?

339
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:31,278
Can you... did you
sleep here last night?

340
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,614
That's not plugged
into anything.

341
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:37,183
It's... it's just a dial on the other side.
It's not actually sputnik.

342
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:38,618
It's just making
you think that it is.

343
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,587
It's just a random beeping.

344
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:42,455
And because you think that
that's supposed to be sputnik,

345
00:22:42,457 --> 00:22:44,090
that's why you believe
it's sputnik.

346
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:47,427
This is what we are
going to do with the moon.

347
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:48,962
I called Brackett,

348
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:51,631
told him that they
can't make it for '69.

349
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:54,701
He said, "okay, well, you've got
to figure out a way to fix it."

350
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:58,238
And I said, "we can
do it on our own.

351
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,175
"We can make a film that
shows us going to the moon

352
00:23:02,177 --> 00:23:04,411
"without actually doing it."

353
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,281
We know that
they can make it up there.

354
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:10,984
We're not... we're faking
the last little piece.

355
00:23:10,986 --> 00:23:13,620
The tiny... The tiny
thing they can't do.

356
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:15,155
Land and come back.

357
00:23:15,157 --> 00:23:16,957
The thing JFK said we'd do.

358
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,491
That's the only part.

359
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:20,994
Everything else is real,
do you understand?

360
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:22,395
Yeah, I understand
what you're saying.

361
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:23,663
And I understand
that it sounds like...

362
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:25,231
Read this, it's from Brackett.

363
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:27,133
He sent a briefing?
Yes.

364
00:23:33,507 --> 00:23:35,542
If we can pull this off,

365
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:38,645
we are going to look
like geniuses.

366
00:23:38,647 --> 00:23:42,215
Four guys inside of NASA
figure out how to

367
00:23:42,217 --> 00:23:44,417
make it look like we went to the moon.
We did it.

368
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:46,519
That's crazy!

369
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:49,089
This is exactly what
we've been waiting for.

370
00:23:49,091 --> 00:23:51,157
It literally fell on our lap.

371
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:57,030
We could run our own department
after something like this.

372
00:24:39,273 --> 00:24:41,608
Is there
more information coming?

373
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,144
About what?

374
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:47,247
Well, the objectives
and the budget.

375
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:49,482
Why?

376
00:24:49,484 --> 00:24:51,651
This doesn't seem
incomplete to you?

377
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:54,320
Incomplete? How?
What do you mean?

378
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:56,256
Well, I...
Okay...

379
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:58,291
You know what, don't...
Don't worry about this.

380
00:24:58,293 --> 00:25:01,194
They obviously told us exactly
what they want us to hear,

381
00:25:01,196 --> 00:25:03,696
so our job is to film a
test, and that's it.

382
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:08,668
Come on.

383
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:13,640
Does it... you don't have an
ethical problem with this at all?

384
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:16,342
In what way?

385
00:25:16,344 --> 00:25:19,179
In that this is lying.

386
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:21,314
You know what, this is like
one of those good lies.

387
00:25:21,316 --> 00:25:23,483
Like Santa Claus
and the Easter bunny.

388
00:25:23,485 --> 00:25:25,652
A lot of kids get really
mad about those.

389
00:25:29,524 --> 00:25:32,125
So we're shooting this
at 48 frames a second,

390
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:34,160
so you're going to
have to move like...

391
00:25:34,162 --> 00:25:35,862
Like you're being lifted up...

392
00:25:35,864 --> 00:25:38,431
Okay? Like this... This thing
weighs about 100 pounds.

393
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:40,266
Well, just try it.
Try leaping a bit.

394
00:25:40,268 --> 00:25:41,701
Like this.

395
00:25:49,777 --> 00:25:51,177
Yeah, good.

396
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:52,612
Go! Action! Action!

397
00:25:55,649 --> 00:25:57,684
More that way.

398
00:25:57,686 --> 00:25:59,219
More towards me a bit.

399
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:01,121
Walk off that way.

400
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:03,490
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

401
00:26:03,492 --> 00:26:05,525
Stop.

402
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,731
We should be
doing this at night.

403
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:13,867
Can, can the light move a
little bit to the left?

404
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:15,602
I'm being devoured
and I'm cookin'.

405
00:26:15,604 --> 00:26:17,670
No, that's too far.
That's too far.

406
00:26:17,672 --> 00:26:19,806
Back over this way.
Back to your right.

407
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:22,175
It doesn't matter...
Stop! Stop!

408
00:26:22,177 --> 00:26:24,410
Okay, now a bit to your left.

409
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:26,179
How much does
the light drop off?

410
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:28,381
Are you not getting
destroyed by mosquitoes?

411
00:26:28,383 --> 00:26:30,717
Okay, I am, but I'm trying
to get this right. Hold on.

412
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,619
What else is in the frame?

413
00:26:32,621 --> 00:26:35,188
Uh, I see some logs
in the background.

414
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,390
Yeah, I see it, too.
Okay, I'm getting it.

415
00:26:39,627 --> 00:26:42,228
That's what you're...

416
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,831
Please, let's just roll.
It's fine, it's fine.

417
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,699
It's not a log, it's a rock!

418
00:26:46,701 --> 00:26:48,835
It's okay, we'll frame it out.

419
00:26:48,837 --> 00:26:50,703
I'm going to use it!

420
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:52,572
I'm going to put it
in the frame.

421
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:54,474
Are you ready?

422
00:26:54,476 --> 00:26:56,509
And action!

423
00:26:59,647 --> 00:27:01,714
Owen, jump in the air.

424
00:27:01,716 --> 00:27:03,316
Holy shit.

425
00:27:04,586 --> 00:27:05,818
It's open!

426
00:27:07,588 --> 00:27:10,190
Hey.
You're just in time.

427
00:27:10,192 --> 00:27:11,758
Have a seat. So...

428
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,327
The moon footage...
I won't say how it looks.

429
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:17,330
I just want you to watch it, okay?
Turn the lights off.

430
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,301
So it may seem a bit different.

431
00:27:21,303 --> 00:27:23,203
I think you'll enjoy it.

432
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:36,449
This is the year
before we got recruited.

433
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:37,750
Wow.

434
00:27:47,862 --> 00:27:50,263
Who is it?

435
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:51,631
Hello?

436
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:57,437
Director Brackett,
this is a... uh, come on in.

437
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:03,009
Welcome.

438
00:28:05,512 --> 00:28:08,248
It's great to see you guys.
This is a surprise.

439
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,450
What the hell is going on?

440
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:13,553
You're changing the direction on this
project without my authorization?

441
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:16,256
Okay...
Shut up. I'm not finished.

442
00:28:16,258 --> 00:28:17,557
Okay, now listen...
I'm shutting this operation...

443
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,625
Wait!
Bring it down. It's over.

444
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:19,993
You made this up?

445
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:26,399
Okay, yes.
I made up a mission.

446
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:29,702
But that's because I wanted to make sure
it would work before I brought it to you.

447
00:28:29,704 --> 00:28:31,671
I think I may have solved

448
00:28:31,673 --> 00:28:33,439
the moon problem.

449
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:35,642
Just... trust me.
Watch this.

450
00:28:36,844 --> 00:28:38,811
Sorry.

451
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:42,582
Ignore this. Ignore this.

452
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:07,707
So that's just sand.

453
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:09,042
William's in the suit.

454
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:10,843
We shot it in slow motion.

455
00:29:14,748 --> 00:29:16,849
You understand?

456
00:29:16,851 --> 00:29:20,953
I'm saying we could fake the moon
landing, and it wouldn't be hard.

457
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:23,723
All people want to see

458
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:25,558
is an image
on a television screen

459
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,093
and we can give them that.

460
00:29:27,095 --> 00:29:28,728
The rocket will go up,

461
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,563
we'll send our
footage with them,

462
00:29:30,565 --> 00:29:32,832
and the astronauts will
just beam it back to earth.

463
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:36,669
No one is going to think this is fake,
because how insane would that be?

464
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:38,071
And if we do it right,

465
00:29:38,073 --> 00:29:40,873
this is the kind of thing
that sells itself.

466
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,975
Walter Cronkite is going
to do half the work for us.

467
00:29:45,846 --> 00:29:47,980
Let me try.

468
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:52,852
Give us a minute.

469
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,611
It's okay.

470
00:30:21,382 --> 00:30:23,483
Hi.

471
00:30:26,053 --> 00:30:27,120
Whoa!

472
00:30:38,432 --> 00:30:40,666
Okay, just shoot
from down there, okay?

473
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:42,735
Owen?

474
00:30:42,737 --> 00:30:45,071
Put... put your mic on.
No.

475
00:30:45,073 --> 00:30:47,540
Put your mic on. Put your... It'll
take two seconds. Put your mic on.

476
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:50,610
Come on. It'll take two seconds.
I'm not doing this, okay?

477
00:30:52,012 --> 00:30:54,113
Get the fuck off.
Cheer up!

478
00:30:54,115 --> 00:30:56,649
We just got a huge
promotion, come on!

479
00:30:58,752 --> 00:31:00,186
Whoo!

480
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:09,462
Mr. boles, I guess we'll
be working together again.

481
00:31:09,464 --> 00:31:11,097
Welcome to Texas.

482
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:13,633
Congratulations on having Brackett
approve this insane mission.

483
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:16,836
You guys are filming
this right now?

484
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:18,838
Yeah, we film everything.
It's a documentary.

485
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,707
It's a documentary film.

486
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:24,977
Okay, before we get started on this,
I know you're technically my boss,

487
00:31:24,979 --> 00:31:26,879
but I'm running all this.

488
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:28,781
Yeah.

489
00:31:28,783 --> 00:31:30,783
No, I'm here because you have
no idea what you're doing.

490
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:34,687
So I'm in charge and you
don't run a goddamn thing.

491
00:31:37,858 --> 00:31:40,960
So no more fucking around
behind our backs, all right?

492
00:31:49,036 --> 00:31:51,637
Wow, I heard it's pretty shitty.

493
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:53,673
Hi.
How you doing?

494
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:55,241
Enjoying the 4th of July?

495
00:31:55,243 --> 00:31:57,510
Yes, I'm in a great mood.

496
00:31:57,512 --> 00:32:00,813
This is a bit of a party for me,
too, because we got a promotion.

497
00:32:00,815 --> 00:32:02,615
Did you?
Yeah.

498
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:06,486
Somebody just
tell me what's wrong.

499
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:08,688
Is that...
That's the barbecue.

500
00:32:11,525 --> 00:32:14,627
The barbecue what? What happened
at the barbecue? What's going on?

501
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:16,095
Watch.

502
00:32:16,097 --> 00:32:17,897
Right...

503
00:32:18,832 --> 00:32:20,666
There. See that?

504
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:23,503
Yeah, two guys.
Yeah. Look at this.

505
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:28,841
So he's holding something,
we're thinking maybe super 8.

506
00:32:28,843 --> 00:32:30,843
It could be a 35mm still camera.

507
00:32:30,845 --> 00:32:34,547
And do we know who this is?
Maybe they're NASA guests.

508
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:36,883
Yeah, I don't know.
Tourists? Who knows, right?

509
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,286
It could be nothing.

510
00:32:40,288 --> 00:32:42,655
It is nothing...

511
00:32:42,657 --> 00:32:44,056
Who is it?

512
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:45,791
It's boles.

513
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:55,535
This looks like shit.

514
00:32:56,738 --> 00:32:59,906
You have one guy
in a space suit,

515
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:01,741
prancing around on the sand...

516
00:33:01,743 --> 00:33:03,709
with one rock.

517
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:04,911
Who do you think
this is gonna convince?

518
00:33:04,913 --> 00:33:06,812
I...
It convinced Brackett.

519
00:33:06,814 --> 00:33:09,081
Well, now you have
to convince me.

520
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,249
What are you talking about?

521
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:11,851
Nobody is going to buy this.

522
00:33:11,853 --> 00:33:14,153
I thought you were advocating
for me to do this!

523
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:16,789
I was advocating
for operation Northwoods.

524
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,591
I think this idea's ridiculous.

525
00:33:30,672 --> 00:33:33,873
Mike, do you remember
mentioning, uh, test locations

526
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:36,275
that NASA was using
for photography?

527
00:33:36,277 --> 00:33:38,010
Would you mind
showing me those pictures?

528
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:39,211
You mean on camera, or...

529
00:33:39,213 --> 00:33:41,047
If you don't mind.
I don't mind.

530
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:43,249
These are places that look
like the moon on earth?

531
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:47,853
Exactly. These are called
geology field trips.

532
00:33:47,855 --> 00:33:49,989
So you're saying that the
rocks that are on the moon

533
00:33:49,991 --> 00:33:51,924
are the exact same
as the rocks on earth?

534
00:33:51,926 --> 00:33:53,960
I'm not saying exact. I'm saying...
But they're close?

535
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:56,329
They're close enough that...
That...

536
00:33:56,331 --> 00:33:58,931
Yeah, I mean... So if you saw
them, you would think that, uh...

537
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:01,133
Oh, yeah, you can
get an igneous rock

538
00:34:01,135 --> 00:34:03,336
from a volcano here in America

539
00:34:03,338 --> 00:34:04,837
and tell somebody
it's a moon rock

540
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,238
and they wouldn't know.

541
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,873
Really?
Yeah.

542
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:19,385
- Hello.
- Is Owen home?

543
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:21,754
He's in the garage.

544
00:34:21,756 --> 00:34:23,089
You look great.

545
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,096
FBI!

546
00:34:30,098 --> 00:34:31,230
Look at this!

547
00:34:31,232 --> 00:34:33,399
The geologists have
places on earth

548
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:35,067
that already look like the moon.

549
00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:38,237
This is the Barringer crater,
the Grand Canyon.

550
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,806
We shoot this test footage

551
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:42,908
and then compare it
with the real moon footage

552
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:45,277
that they're getting
from the missions.

553
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:46,679
I just figured this out!

554
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:48,681
Yeah, I can't go on this trip.

555
00:34:48,683 --> 00:34:50,416
What?
What do you mean?

556
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:52,151
Why?

557
00:34:52,153 --> 00:34:54,086
Because I... because I...
I need you.

558
00:34:54,088 --> 00:34:56,255
If you don't come with me I'm
going with boles, by myself.

559
00:34:56,257 --> 00:34:58,157
What? Are you
still mad at me?

560
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,859
I'm sorry.
I didn't...

561
00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:01,160
Owen!

562
00:35:01,162 --> 00:35:03,095
One second!

563
00:35:03,097 --> 00:35:05,898
I... you have to forgive me for this.
Listen.

564
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,066
I can't go.

565
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:14,306
You're fucking me. You are...
You're fucking me.

566
00:35:19,212 --> 00:35:21,447
<i>This is the big shot.</i>

567
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:25,351
<i>The ride without astronauts of
the giant Saturn v live rocket.</i>

568
00:35:25,353 --> 00:35:28,421
<i>Project Apollo.</i>
<i>This is</i> Apollo 4.

569
00:35:28,423 --> 00:35:31,090
<i>The test of our moon rocket
in flight for the first time.</i>

570
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:33,793
<i>It is the beginning,
the first of many steps,</i>

571
00:35:33,795 --> 00:35:37,329
<i>which will someday put men
on the surface of the moon.</i>

572
00:35:53,914 --> 00:35:55,314
How far off can you see?

573
00:35:55,316 --> 00:35:56,849
You've got to picture it
in black and white.

574
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:58,250
With the sun behind us there.

575
00:35:58,252 --> 00:35:59,385
We can even do a pan.

576
00:35:59,387 --> 00:36:01,454
What do you think?

577
00:36:01,456 --> 00:36:03,756
<i>We don't know if you can hear,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

578
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:06,992
<i>But, oh, the flight is moving
along as it should be...</i>

579
00:36:06,994 --> 00:36:09,428
<i>But our tape records are
being thrown to the floor</i>

580
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:12,998
<i>by the roar of
this mighty rocket,</i>

581
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,834
<i>as it continues
to climb into the sky,</i>

582
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:18,204
<i>on its seven and a half
million pounds of thrust.</i>

583
00:36:18,206 --> 00:36:21,140
<i>It's a beautiful sight,
an unbelievable sight...</i>

584
00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:24,343
So I didn't tell him
I made the whole thing up,

585
00:36:24,345 --> 00:36:26,178
and then you
and Brackett show up,

586
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,480
and then he punches me,

587
00:36:27,482 --> 00:36:28,881
now he's acting like
we aren't friends.

588
00:36:28,883 --> 00:36:30,850
What would you do?

589
00:36:30,852 --> 00:36:32,785
Well, I wouldn't have done
that in the first place.

590
00:36:32,787 --> 00:36:34,053
Okay, yeah, but pretend
that you're as stupid as me

591
00:36:34,055 --> 00:36:35,154
and you have done that.

592
00:37:02,415 --> 00:37:04,984
God damn it, look at this!

593
00:37:04,986 --> 00:37:07,119
We weren't even close.

594
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:08,287
No kidding.

595
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:14,059
Here.

596
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:18,230
Okay... Okay, who else
has seen this footage?

597
00:37:18,232 --> 00:37:19,431
Everyone.

598
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:21,066
See, this is what we need.

599
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:24,003
We need the actual
footage of the moon.

600
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:26,872
How do we get astronauts
to act in front of this?

601
00:37:26,874 --> 00:37:29,542
You could start
by hiring a real director.

602
00:37:31,511 --> 00:37:34,013
Or you could give up
this mission.

603
00:37:35,882 --> 00:37:37,316
Yeah.

604
00:37:50,865 --> 00:37:52,031
Hey, don, how are you?

605
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:53,599
It's Matt Johnson.

606
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:55,134
No, I'm calling from Houston,

607
00:37:55,136 --> 00:37:58,170
they got me out here
on operation zipper.

608
00:37:58,172 --> 00:38:00,105
Listen, can...
I actually need a favor.

609
00:38:00,107 --> 00:38:03,042
Do we have a last known
address for Stanley Kubrick

610
00:38:03,044 --> 00:38:05,144
when we were doing
operation deep red?

611
00:38:05,146 --> 00:38:06,579
I'm looking at some of his
movie effects and...

612
00:38:06,581 --> 00:38:08,447
"No, of course I'd
like to say hello!"

613
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:09,882
<i>Of course I'd like to say hello.</i>

614
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:11,050
And I'm watching something.

615
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:12,451
Would you mind giving me that?

616
00:38:15,957 --> 00:38:19,124
Hi, could you give me the phone
number to an address in New York?

617
00:38:20,927 --> 00:38:22,528
239.

618
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,264
Uh, actually, it's Polaris
productions, incorporated.

619
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:26,332
23...

620
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:27,933
My name's Matt Johnson,

621
00:38:27,935 --> 00:38:30,436
I'm a documentary filmmaker
working at NASA,

622
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:32,571
and I need to ask him
a few questions.

623
00:38:32,573 --> 00:38:34,206
Is he there?

624
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:36,208
It's an emergency.

625
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,644
Of course not. No. And... And
that's not what this is, ma'am.

626
00:38:38,646 --> 00:38:40,179
Yes, hello, my name is
Michael Kubrick.

627
00:38:40,181 --> 00:38:41,513
I'm looking for my brother.

628
00:38:41,515 --> 00:38:43,215
Well, I'm calling
from the United States

629
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:44,650
and I'm... and I'm really
trying to talk with him.

630
00:38:44,652 --> 00:38:48,621
I've got some very bad news
about our father.

631
00:38:48,623 --> 00:38:50,656
Can you give me
a phone number for that?

632
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:52,524
What time is it in England?

633
00:38:52,526 --> 00:38:54,360
I'm looking for
a Mr. Stanley Kubrick.

634
00:38:54,362 --> 00:38:56,962
I'm a documentary filmmaker
from the United States.

635
00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:00,599
This is not a personal call.

636
00:39:00,601 --> 00:39:04,470
I'm actually calling from
NASA and I'm wondering if...

637
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:06,138
Oh, thank you.

638
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:11,677
Hello, Madeleine. I'm not sure
why I got connected with you.

639
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:13,979
I'm calling from NASA.

640
00:39:13,981 --> 00:39:16,141
I'm making a documentary here
about the Apollo program.

641
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:23,289
Ah.

642
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:25,391
What are you guys
doing over there,

643
00:39:25,393 --> 00:39:27,259
if you don't mind me asking?

644
00:39:33,133 --> 00:39:38,671
Stanley Kubrick is making a new
movie about the moon landing,

645
00:39:38,673 --> 00:39:41,106
and I'm willing to bet that we
can use the special effects

646
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:43,275
that he's doing there
to do this.

647
00:39:43,277 --> 00:39:44,543
Okay, but...

648
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:48,447
We can't just walk
onto a film set.

649
00:39:48,449 --> 00:39:54,053
He has two NASA scientists
advising him.

650
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:57,389
We're going to go and say
we're going to interview them.

651
00:39:57,391 --> 00:39:59,425
Do you see what's going on here?

652
00:39:59,427 --> 00:40:01,660
Kubrick is getting NASA

653
00:40:01,662 --> 00:40:05,164
to make sure that his space
movie looks like real space.

654
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:07,399
And so we're going
to use his space movie

655
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:10,302
to make sure the real space
movie looks like space!

656
00:40:10,304 --> 00:40:12,438
Do you understand
how crazy that is?

657
00:40:28,755 --> 00:40:30,422
Welcome to England!

658
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,259
It's not too loud?

659
00:40:34,261 --> 00:40:36,195
No, well, it'll be
packed inside the bag.

660
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:48,540
Not bad for... For on the
spot, just figured it out!

661
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:54,046
Jared, wave!

662
00:40:54,048 --> 00:40:55,614
Jared, big wave!

663
00:41:01,354 --> 00:41:03,188
Yeah, that's her.

664
00:41:09,195 --> 00:41:11,263
Madeleine!

665
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,605
You won't be able to bring
that camera inside.

666
00:41:19,607 --> 00:41:22,174
You'll have to shut it off as
soon as we get in, I'm afraid.

667
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,709
Is Mr...
The set's all live.

668
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:25,444
No problem.
Is Mr. Kubrick inside?

669
00:41:25,446 --> 00:41:27,646
He is, but security
is very tight.

670
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:30,816
You'll be thrown off the set if you
try to approach him, so please don't.

671
00:41:30,818 --> 00:41:32,551
You got it.
Go ahead.

672
00:41:32,553 --> 00:41:33,752
Thank you.

673
00:41:47,567 --> 00:41:50,135
Please wait right here.

674
00:41:50,137 --> 00:41:52,237
Yeah, sure.
We'll stay right here.

675
00:41:57,544 --> 00:41:59,511
It might be better to just
play it as a medium shot

676
00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:01,713
- in this situation.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

677
00:42:01,715 --> 00:42:03,515
Can you do it
with your head down?

678
00:42:03,517 --> 00:42:05,250
What about out there?

679
00:42:05,252 --> 00:42:08,287
- Well, that's not bad.
- Let's do that.

680
00:42:09,722 --> 00:42:11,657
Right.
Check the gate, Doug.

681
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:32,211
I... I would never normally do
this, but it's for a friend.

682
00:42:32,213 --> 00:42:35,347
His name is Matt Johnson.
Mmm-hmm.

683
00:42:43,423 --> 00:42:46,692
Jared, tell me
you are getting this.

684
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:48,260
Oh, my god.

685
00:42:48,262 --> 00:42:49,728
Excuse me?

686
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:53,432
How did you set this up?

687
00:42:54,868 --> 00:42:57,603
Owen, it's called
front screen projection!

688
00:42:57,605 --> 00:42:58,804
We got it!

689
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:03,909
Kubrick's technique,
how he's faking...

690
00:43:05,678 --> 00:43:07,713
I wanna...
I wanna tell you.

691
00:43:15,288 --> 00:43:17,156
Boles, hey.

692
00:43:17,158 --> 00:43:18,824
It's called
front screen projection.

693
00:43:18,826 --> 00:43:20,826
We figured out how to,
how to do it.

694
00:43:22,695 --> 00:43:25,397
Yeah, okay, all right.
I'll, uh...

695
00:43:25,399 --> 00:43:27,866
Do you want us
to fly right there, or...

696
00:43:30,203 --> 00:43:32,404
Sure.

697
00:43:44,584 --> 00:43:47,586
All right, it's called
front screen projection.

698
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:50,689
Stanley Kubrick can fake
any environment he wants,

699
00:43:50,691 --> 00:43:53,592
by projecting it through
a semi-transparent mirror

700
00:43:53,594 --> 00:43:56,361
and then onto
a gigantic silver screen.

701
00:43:56,363 --> 00:43:59,731
Then he films the entire scene
through the same mirror,

702
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:02,334
at a 90-degree angle
to the projector.

703
00:44:02,336 --> 00:44:05,737
What it winds up doing
is creating images

704
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:09,675
where you can't tell
where the stage stops

705
00:44:11,678 --> 00:44:14,880
and the fake photographic
background begins.

706
00:44:14,882 --> 00:44:16,982
You have an infinite
depth of field,

707
00:44:16,984 --> 00:44:22,688
into environments that exist
completely in two-dimensional space.

708
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:25,958
We can do the same thing with
the lunar surface photography

709
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,760
that NASA is taking
on the Apollo missions.

710
00:44:32,865 --> 00:44:36,535
<i>Movie special effects
can be very convincing,</i>

711
00:44:36,537 --> 00:44:40,739
<i>especially when you don't
know you're watching a movie.</i>

712
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:43,942
<i>The plan is to rent
a film studio in Texas,</i>

713
00:44:43,944 --> 00:44:48,513
<i>hire a crew, and have them
build our own lunar lander.</i>

714
00:44:48,515 --> 00:44:50,716
<i>We'll mix
this practical set piece,</i>

715
00:44:50,718 --> 00:44:53,585
<i>with Kubrick's projection
technique, and presto,</i>

716
00:44:53,587 --> 00:44:56,521
<i>the illusion that man
is walking on the moon.</i>

717
00:44:56,523 --> 00:44:59,458
<i>Now I know you're probably thinking
this is too much exposure,</i>

718
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,461
<i>and that the risk of bringing
in outsiders is too high,</i>

719
00:45:02,463 --> 00:45:05,430
<i>but we already have
the perfect cover.</i>

720
00:45:05,432 --> 00:45:09,268
<i>We're making a documentary
about the moon landing.</i>

721
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,271
<i>And it's not a stretch to say that we're
building sets to conduct interviews,</i>

722
00:45:12,273 --> 00:45:13,739
<i>shoot b-roll footage.</i>

723
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:15,707
<i>We could even say
it's for simulations.</i>

724
00:45:15,709 --> 00:45:18,844
<i>Hell, most of the major networks
are doing this already.</i>

725
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:20,512
<i>The only people who need to
know what's actually happening</i>

726
00:45:20,514 --> 00:45:22,748
<i>are the astronauts,</i>

727
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,417
<i>who you should select based on
their willingness to cooperate,</i>

728
00:45:25,419 --> 00:45:27,552
<i>and James Webb,</i>

729
00:45:27,554 --> 00:45:30,622
<i>who's either going to have to work
with us, or get out of the way.</i>

730
00:45:30,624 --> 00:45:32,691
And that's the easy part.

731
00:45:32,693 --> 00:45:34,793
We also need to convince
everybody at NASA.

732
00:45:34,795 --> 00:45:37,663
The good news is the only people
who are in contact with the rocket

733
00:45:37,665 --> 00:45:39,398
are all in one room in Houston,

734
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,799
inside mission control.

735
00:45:41,968 --> 00:45:44,436
<i>If we can convince
mission control</i>

736
00:45:44,438 --> 00:45:45,537
<i>that what they're doing is real,</i>

737
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:46,638
<i>everybody else will follow.</i>

738
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,507
<i>How do we do that?</i>

739
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:51,343
Well, mission control
actually monitors everything,

740
00:45:51,345 --> 00:45:52,844
<i>from the heart rates
of the astronauts,</i>

741
00:45:52,846 --> 00:45:54,613
<i>to the exact location
of the lunar module</i>

742
00:45:54,615 --> 00:45:56,715
<i>as it descends to the moon.</i>

743
00:45:56,717 --> 00:45:58,917
<i>And they're getting all this
information through radio,</i>

744
00:45:58,919 --> 00:46:00,552
<i>directly from the ship.</i>

745
00:46:00,554 --> 00:46:03,322
The good news is that
they've run so many tests

746
00:46:03,324 --> 00:46:05,457
with this exact mission

747
00:46:05,459 --> 00:46:09,561
that they actually have telemetric
data of successful lunar landings,

748
00:46:09,563 --> 00:46:12,731
<i>stored on guidance systems</i>
<i>on</i> Apollo 11.

749
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:16,568
Here's where we get very lucky.

750
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,003
As the command module
passes along

751
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:19,604
to the dark side of the moon,

752
00:46:19,606 --> 00:46:22,641
the radio signals
can't penetrate the core.

753
00:46:22,643 --> 00:46:24,843
For 30 minutes, we have a window

754
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:29,481
for the astronauts to switch from
real data, to fake telemetric data.

755
00:46:29,483 --> 00:46:31,750
<i>Mission control
will be getting data</i>

756
00:46:31,752 --> 00:46:35,520
<i>of the lunar module undocking and
landing on the lunar surface,</i>

757
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:37,889
<i>but it will be completely faked.</i>

758
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:40,058
Combine that with our footage

759
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:43,362
that the astronauts are going to pipe
into the broadcast back to earth,

760
00:46:43,364 --> 00:46:45,931
and nobody's
going to have any idea.

761
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:48,633
<i>As far as NASA and the rest
of the world is concerned,</i>

762
00:46:48,635 --> 00:46:50,769
<i>the United States
just landed on the moon.</i>

763
00:46:50,771 --> 00:46:54,406
Finally, the broadcast.

764
00:46:54,408 --> 00:46:56,875
To shoot in slow motion,
we have to shoot film.

765
00:46:56,877 --> 00:46:59,444
To broadcast
it needs to be video.

766
00:46:59,446 --> 00:47:00,579
Which means we have
to do a transfer,

767
00:47:00,581 --> 00:47:02,147
which normally would be fine,

768
00:47:02,149 --> 00:47:06,118
except that people cannot know
it originally began as film.

769
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,587
That means a single
scratch, any dust...

770
00:47:08,589 --> 00:47:10,522
Okay, okay.
We got it.

771
00:47:10,524 --> 00:47:11,890
Thank you for the presentation.

772
00:47:11,892 --> 00:47:13,992
You can go ahead.

773
00:47:13,994 --> 00:47:16,161
- Thank you, sir.
- Talk to your folks about the Northwoods plan.

774
00:47:16,163 --> 00:47:17,796
Tell them to put a hold on it

775
00:47:17,798 --> 00:47:20,565
and we'll see how this develops.

776
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:22,801
Director, what is
the Northwoods plan?

777
00:47:22,803 --> 00:47:25,437
I've never heard of
operation Northwoods.

778
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:29,107
Shoot down<i> Apollo 11</i>
and blame the Soviets.

779
00:47:30,544 --> 00:47:32,444
With the astronauts
on the flight?

780
00:47:32,446 --> 00:47:34,613
Why would we do that?

781
00:47:36,149 --> 00:47:38,750
If your film
doesn't come together,

782
00:47:38,752 --> 00:47:41,186
then we have to have
a backup plan.

783
00:47:41,188 --> 00:47:43,822
And that is our backup plan.

784
00:47:58,938 --> 00:48:01,473
<i>Plan? I've never heard
of operation Northwoods.</i>

785
00:48:01,475 --> 00:48:03,675
<i>Shoot down Apollo 11
and blame the Soviets.</i>

786
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:32,671
<i>Who were these men
going to the moon?</i>

787
00:48:32,673 --> 00:48:36,741
<i>David Schoumacher profiled
the crew of Apollo 11.</i>

788
00:48:36,743 --> 00:48:38,743
<i>Neil Armstrong,</i>

789
00:48:38,745 --> 00:48:42,180
<i>the man chosen to be first
to step upon the moon.</i>

790
00:48:42,182 --> 00:48:45,517
<i>He is by all accounts
intelligent, courteous,</i>

791
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:47,886
<i>sober, a good family man.</i>

792
00:48:47,888 --> 00:48:50,555
<i>He is perfect for the role,</i>

793
00:48:50,557 --> 00:48:54,793
<i>beyond what a Hollywood
scriptwriter would dare.</i>

794
00:48:54,795 --> 00:48:57,796
<i>Buzz Aldrin is perhaps the most
brilliant of the astronauts.</i>

795
00:48:57,798 --> 00:49:00,031
<i>Some say even a genius.</i>

796
00:49:00,033 --> 00:49:04,736
<i>His doctorate at Mit came after
a thesis on orbital rendezvous,</i>

797
00:49:04,738 --> 00:49:08,039
<i>and he understands the abstract
theory of space mechanics</i>

798
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:10,542
<i>as well as anyone.</i>

799
00:49:10,544 --> 00:49:15,514
<i>Mike Collins is the least technical in
outlook of the Apollo 11 astronauts,</i>

800
00:49:15,516 --> 00:49:17,148
<i>but the most philosophical.</i>

801
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,117
<i>If he does not love machines,</i>

802
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:23,188
<i>he does love wine,
and books, and roses.</i>

803
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:25,957
<i>A man who has known all
three pilots for many years</i>

804
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:28,560
<i>says if he were
forced down on an island,</i>

805
00:49:28,562 --> 00:49:30,295
<i>he would want it
to be with Collins</i>

806
00:49:30,297 --> 00:49:32,597
<i>for the quality
of his personality.</i>

807
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:34,132
<i>Another said
he would prefer Aldrin,</i>

808
00:49:34,134 --> 00:49:36,167
<i>because with his intelligence</i>

809
00:49:36,169 --> 00:49:38,303
<i>he would soon be converting
sea water to fresh water</i>

810
00:49:38,305 --> 00:49:40,972
<i>and otherwise logically
attacking the problem.</i>

811
00:49:40,974 --> 00:49:43,542
<i>But both agreed
in the final analysis,</i>

812
00:49:43,544 --> 00:49:46,711
<i>that they would hope
it was with Armstrong,</i>

813
00:49:46,713 --> 00:49:50,615
<i>because, somehow,
he would get them off of it.</i>

814
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:59,257
Hello?

815
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:02,227
Boles, we just got back.
Where are you?

816
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:06,164
Okay. Turn on the TV.

817
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:08,166
Yeah, okay.
I'm turning it on now.

818
00:50:08,168 --> 00:50:10,635
- Why?
- <i>Summarize what you just said,</i>

819
00:50:10,637 --> 00:50:12,270
<i>and then we'll ask you some questions
about seeing the president?</i>

820
00:50:12,272 --> 00:50:17,042
<i>Uh, yes, I'd like to say
that, uh, over a year ago,</i>

821
00:50:17,044 --> 00:50:20,745
<i>president Johnson and I
reviewed the space program</i>

822
00:50:20,747 --> 00:50:24,082
<i>and, uh, agreed
to build strength</i>

823
00:50:24,084 --> 00:50:27,752
<i>so that I might retire
on my 62nd birthday,</i>

824
00:50:27,754 --> 00:50:30,689
<i>which happens to be
this next October 7th.</i>

825
00:50:30,691 --> 00:50:33,925
<i>Today, we have reviewed
the progress we have made</i>

826
00:50:33,927 --> 00:50:35,594
<i>and the president has agreed</i>

827
00:50:35,596 --> 00:50:38,830
<i>that I could retire
on October 7th,</i>

828
00:50:38,832 --> 00:50:40,632
<i>when I will be 62.</i>

829
00:50:40,634 --> 00:50:42,601
<i>I'd like to say
one other thing...</i>

830
00:50:42,603 --> 00:50:44,603
Yeah, okay.
Well, I guess that means

831
00:50:44,605 --> 00:50:46,838
he didn't want
to cooperate, huh?

832
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,206
Okay, yeah.

833
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:50,275
I'll see you when you get back.
Bye.

834
00:50:55,181 --> 00:50:56,881
Andy!

835
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:00,986
Sorry.

836
00:51:03,389 --> 00:51:05,690
What are you doing? Shooting
for the documentary.

837
00:51:05,692 --> 00:51:06,992
Oh, okay, fine.

838
00:51:06,994 --> 00:51:09,327
Where's Owen?
He's at the hospital.

839
00:51:09,329 --> 00:51:10,829
What?

840
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:13,732
Julie had the baby.

841
00:51:13,734 --> 00:51:15,367
Oh, shit!

842
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,971
Hey.

843
00:51:19,973 --> 00:51:21,673
I missed it, hey?

844
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:23,341
Hey, mom.

845
00:51:23,343 --> 00:51:25,043
Wow!

846
00:51:25,045 --> 00:51:26,144
Matt!

847
00:51:26,146 --> 00:51:28,046
What's his name?
Simon.

848
00:51:28,048 --> 00:51:30,015
Can I hold him?
Sure, if you want to.

849
00:51:30,017 --> 00:51:31,650
I need to talk to you.
I need to talk to Matt.

850
00:51:31,652 --> 00:51:33,418
Okay. What's up?

851
00:51:35,254 --> 00:51:38,390
One minute.

852
00:51:38,392 --> 00:51:41,393
Okay, okay.

853
00:51:41,395 --> 00:51:43,728
What the hell is this?

854
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:44,996
Jared showed me
the photos of the men

855
00:51:44,998 --> 00:51:46,965
who were watching us
at the barbecue.

856
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:48,800
They're filming us, Matt! Okay.

857
00:51:48,802 --> 00:51:51,169
Why are you bringing
this up at the hospital?

858
00:51:51,171 --> 00:51:52,737
Relax!

859
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:54,372
Relax? This could
be the Russians.

860
00:51:54,374 --> 00:51:56,941
We have to get off this mission.

861
00:51:56,943 --> 00:52:01,446
If we get caught, the CIA
will abandon us, okay?

862
00:52:01,448 --> 00:52:04,015
I'm calling Brackett to them him...
No! No! No!

863
00:52:04,017 --> 00:52:06,685
You are not calling Brackett.
No one's calling Brackett.

864
00:52:06,687 --> 00:52:08,186
You are being paranoid!

865
00:52:08,188 --> 00:52:11,756
I hope so, because if I'm
right and this is the mole...

866
00:52:11,758 --> 00:52:12,857
If they find out
what we are doing,

867
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:14,759
then we are fucking dead.

868
00:52:14,761 --> 00:52:16,094
You got that?

869
00:53:18,224 --> 00:53:20,125
Looks pretty good.

870
00:53:20,127 --> 00:53:22,494
"Looks pretty good"?
Guys, come on.

871
00:53:25,364 --> 00:53:27,198
Are you kidding me?
All right.

872
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,933
This cost $45,000!

873
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:31,369
Really?
Yeah!

874
00:53:31,371 --> 00:53:33,838
Oh, god, don't start that.

875
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,974
"Really? Hey,
you got ripped off.

876
00:53:35,976 --> 00:53:38,042
"Hey, come on, I could have
done this..." ...Cheaper.

877
00:53:38,044 --> 00:53:40,845
"With $20
and some elbow grease!"

878
00:53:40,847 --> 00:53:43,047
Do you think it would kill you
to say, "good job, Matt"?

879
00:53:45,018 --> 00:53:47,852
I mean that seriously. Do you think
it would physically kill you?

880
00:53:47,854 --> 00:53:49,988
Okay, and it's for a film shoot.

881
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,390
Uh, we're making a documentary
about the moon landing,

882
00:53:52,392 --> 00:53:54,359
and we need to make
a lunar surface.

883
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:57,962
And so it's like a fake lunar surface.
That's what we need.

884
00:53:57,964 --> 00:54:01,299
So I don't know how much
sand you can ship us.

885
00:54:01,301 --> 00:54:03,434
But, uh, four tons?

886
00:54:03,436 --> 00:54:05,370
How many tons are in a truck?
Can you hold on a sec?

887
00:54:05,372 --> 00:54:07,338
Where are you going?

888
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,307
Uh, sorry, say again?

889
00:54:09,309 --> 00:54:12,410
Actually, I went to a place in
Arizona called cinder lake,

890
00:54:12,412 --> 00:54:16,848
where the sand was brown as molasses.
It was beautiful.

891
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:20,251
It was a beautiful brown.
Molten brown.

892
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:30,128
So, what are these guys gonna
say when they're up here?

893
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,564
We need something they
can print as a headline.

894
00:54:32,566 --> 00:54:35,433
<i>Type out a couple things and let's
just see what we got, okay?</i>

895
00:54:35,435 --> 00:54:38,169
So try this,
"welcome to the moon."

896
00:54:39,973 --> 00:54:42,173
Catch!

897
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,509
So, no, leave that where
it was, it's my a rock.

898
00:54:44,511 --> 00:54:47,011
I think if we never say
the word "America."

899
00:54:47,013 --> 00:54:48,546
<i>Oh, yeah, we just take
an American symbol.</i>

900
00:54:48,548 --> 00:54:50,081
Exactly. Eagle.

901
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,149
- Freedom.
- Frontier.

902
00:54:51,151 --> 00:54:53,284
Frontier.

903
00:54:53,286 --> 00:54:56,387
So that needs to make
that pothole there.

904
00:54:56,389 --> 00:54:57,922
Does that have a label on it?

905
00:54:57,924 --> 00:55:01,226
B. So that goes right at your feet.
Perfect.

906
00:55:01,228 --> 00:55:03,228
I just got an idea.

907
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:04,863
You know what we've gotta have
them do when they're up there?

908
00:55:04,865 --> 00:55:06,397
Who is it, Galileo
or somebody, said...

909
00:55:06,399 --> 00:55:07,599
Oh, drop the feather.

910
00:55:07,601 --> 00:55:08,900
Drop the feather and the hammer.

911
00:55:08,902 --> 00:55:10,435
And he said, in a vacuum,

912
00:55:10,437 --> 00:55:12,637
a hammer and a feather
would fall at the same speed.

913
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,405
Well, okay, but how are
we gonna do that?

914
00:55:14,407 --> 00:55:16,341
A lead feather.

915
00:55:16,343 --> 00:55:19,277
Wait a minute, we gotta keep the
flag as stable as possible,

916
00:55:19,279 --> 00:55:21,913
because the wind resistance
makes it billow.

917
00:55:21,915 --> 00:55:23,548
You wave the flag.
You can't do that!

918
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,516
Okay Houston, I'm about
to step off the LM.

919
00:55:25,518 --> 00:55:27,886
He leaves a footprint there.

920
00:55:27,888 --> 00:55:29,487
'Cause they would leave
footprints there. Exactly!

921
00:55:29,489 --> 00:55:31,890
And we so can send photographs
of that back home.

922
00:55:31,892 --> 00:55:34,325
It's... that's...
That is the image!

923
00:55:34,327 --> 00:55:35,560
Write that down, the footprints!

924
00:55:35,562 --> 00:55:38,296
The word "foot" is disgusting.

925
00:55:38,298 --> 00:55:40,565
Maybe people
don't want to hear "foot."

926
00:55:40,567 --> 00:55:42,166
No, "with this step." You
would say, "with this step."

927
00:55:42,168 --> 00:55:44,235
"With this step."

928
00:55:44,237 --> 00:55:47,639
<i>Okay, okay.
"With this step, I..."</i>

929
00:55:47,641 --> 00:55:50,341
<i>No. "As man walks
on the moon..."</i>

930
00:55:50,343 --> 00:55:52,277
<i>Too literal.
Too literal!</i>

931
00:55:52,279 --> 00:55:53,945
<i>"The step of
a single man..."</i>

932
00:55:53,947 --> 00:55:55,213
<i>"The step of a single man.</i>

933
00:55:55,215 --> 00:55:56,981
<i>"But for us
back at home..."</i>

934
00:55:56,983 --> 00:55:59,017
Think of what
a step is like to us.

935
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:00,952
To a man, a step is just a step.

936
00:56:00,954 --> 00:56:04,355
But to an ant looking up at
the man, he looks like a god.

937
00:56:04,357 --> 00:56:05,623
And it doesn't look like a step,

938
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:09,460
it looks like a towering leap.

939
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:16,601
It's like a leap.
It's like a jump.

940
00:56:16,603 --> 00:56:19,237
And this is a leap forward for...
For everything!

941
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:20,571
The next evolutionary step.

942
00:56:20,573 --> 00:56:22,006
A leap forward in science.

943
00:56:22,008 --> 00:56:24,008
- For humanity.
- Exactly!

944
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:39,190
This is good.

945
00:56:45,966 --> 00:56:47,365
Okay, let's try one.

946
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:49,300
Hey.

947
00:56:49,302 --> 00:56:51,736
Do you know who that is outside?
Who?

948
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:55,206
Right there.

949
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:56,641
Look.
Where?

950
00:56:56,643 --> 00:56:58,109
Tell me whose that is.

951
00:56:59,478 --> 00:57:01,346
Is he running?

952
00:57:01,348 --> 00:57:02,714
Did you say hi? Did he look
at you when you came in?

953
00:57:02,716 --> 00:57:04,282
Is there even a guy in there?

954
00:57:04,284 --> 00:57:06,050
He's sitting there watching.

955
00:57:06,052 --> 00:57:08,019
Shh. Shh. Go
outside, you'll see.

956
00:57:08,021 --> 00:57:09,754
I'm sure he works for the studio.
I'll go talk to him.

957
00:57:09,756 --> 00:57:11,990
They know we're here. We're
allowed to be here, okay?

958
00:57:11,992 --> 00:57:13,224
Relax.

959
00:57:13,226 --> 00:57:14,292
Okay.

960
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:19,731
Hi.

961
00:57:24,737 --> 00:57:28,039
Go, go, go, go!

962
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:30,008
Jared, get in the car!

963
00:57:39,385 --> 00:57:41,152
Boles, what are you doing?

964
00:57:43,456 --> 00:57:45,590
What happened?
You shot your fucking gun!

965
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,394
Jared, shoot out the front,

966
00:57:49,396 --> 00:57:51,329
try to get their license plate!

967
00:57:52,331 --> 00:57:55,466
Come on!

968
00:57:55,468 --> 00:57:57,502
- No!
- What?

969
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:07,145
What happened?

970
00:58:07,147 --> 00:58:08,679
What happened to your car?

971
00:58:08,681 --> 00:58:11,249
It stalled.
They got away.

972
00:58:11,251 --> 00:58:13,484
Well, did
you get a look at them?

973
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,721
Whoever it is,
they know we're here.

974
00:58:16,723 --> 00:58:17,789
Well, we don't know who it is.

975
00:58:17,791 --> 00:58:20,258
I think it's the mole.

976
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,293
I think it's the mole that you guys sent
us here to find in the first place.

977
00:58:22,295 --> 00:58:24,162
Who else is waiting
outside the studio

978
00:58:24,164 --> 00:58:25,530
and then the minute we walk out...
Let's lock it up.

979
00:58:25,532 --> 00:58:27,198
Let's lock it up
and call Brackett.

980
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,466
What... lock it up?
We're in the middle of this!

981
00:58:28,468 --> 00:58:30,201
We can't just stop shooting!

982
00:58:30,203 --> 00:58:32,170
Well, there might be
guys on the roof.

983
00:58:32,172 --> 00:58:33,438
What do you mean,
guys on the roof?

984
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,505
What the fuck is going on?

985
00:58:34,507 --> 00:58:36,274
And what, you got a gun?

986
00:58:36,276 --> 00:58:38,376
<i>This is</i> CBS news <i>special report.</i>

987
00:58:38,378 --> 00:58:40,144
<i>The flight of</i> Apollo 8.

<i>The flight of Apollo 8 is over.</i>

991
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,655
<i>And all that remains is to remove the

992
00:58:50,657 --> 00:58:52,790

less than two miles</i>

995
00:58:58,665 --> 00:59:01,365
<i>have been accelerated
considerably.</i>

996
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:03,801

<i>to test out the landing module,</i>

1000
00:59:13,746 --> 00:59:17,348

1001
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:20,351
<i>two flights further on
in the middle of July.</i>

1002
00:59:22,287 --> 00:59:26,257
So we've got
good news and bad news.

1003
00:59:26,259 --> 00:59:30,795
Good news, his name
is Antonin Lhotsky.

1004
00:59:30,797 --> 00:59:33,464
Uh-huh.
- He's a KGB agent.

1005
00:59:33,466 --> 00:59:35,433
He's the man from outside
the studio the other night.

1006
00:59:35,435 --> 00:59:37,301
Whoa, what?

1007
00:59:37,303 --> 00:59:39,570
We suspect he's been the
mole the entire time.

1008
00:59:39,572 --> 00:59:42,473
So... so then he knows about avalanche.
We're fucked!

1009
00:59:42,475 --> 00:59:44,408
We don't think he does.

1010
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,177
We've been interrogating him
for the past couple of days.

1011
00:59:46,179 --> 00:59:47,378
He doesn't seem
to know anything.

1012
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,814
We've raided
his house. Nothing.

1013
00:59:49,816 --> 00:59:52,483
This guy's the mole?
And you... you got him?

1014
00:59:52,485 --> 00:59:53,918
We got him.

1015
00:59:54,853 --> 00:59:59,657
So, then what?
We're just...

1016
00:59:59,659 --> 01:00:00,758
We're good?

1017
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,627
Well, not entirely.

1018
01:00:02,629 --> 01:00:06,531
We, uh, got some new intel
on the Soviet progress,

1019
01:00:06,533 --> 01:00:09,700
and it turns out they're doing
better than we thought.

1020
01:00:09,702 --> 01:00:14,805
It looks like they could possibly make
it to the moon by the end of '69.

1021
01:00:14,807 --> 01:00:19,177
Which means that we need to be
done by April at the latest.

1022
01:00:20,546 --> 01:00:23,581
Yeah, that puts us
on a pretty tight timeline.

1023
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:25,416
<i>They know we're here.</i>

1024
01:00:25,418 --> 01:00:27,318
<i>We're allowed to be here, okay?
Relax.</i>

1025
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,953
<i>Hi.</i>

1026
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,761
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

1027
01:00:38,564 --> 01:00:40,731
<i>Jared, get in the car!</i>

1028
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,427
<i>Hello?
Matt, we have a problem here.</i>

1029
01:01:12,232 --> 01:01:16,601
<i>Gentleman got the contract
with, I don't know, somebody.</i>

1030
01:01:16,603 --> 01:01:18,936
This is who they say
the mole was.

1031
01:01:18,938 --> 01:01:21,505
So we interviewed him?

1032
01:01:21,507 --> 01:01:24,942
Yeah, over a year ago.

1033
01:01:24,944 --> 01:01:28,012
Remember when you asked me to find
out who was on the phone with Webb?

1034
01:01:28,014 --> 01:01:29,413
Of course.

1035
01:01:29,415 --> 01:01:31,549
I did.

1036
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:33,517
<i>Second burn
to the lunar surface.</i>

1037
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:35,786
<i>Then we can go in after...
For 250.</i>

1038
01:01:35,788 --> 01:01:38,256
<i>250 seconds is all we can do?</i>

1039
01:01:38,258 --> 01:01:40,591
<i>That's the maximum,
and you know that...</i>

1040
01:01:40,593 --> 01:01:42,627
<i>Did you talk to TRW?</i>

1041
01:01:42,629 --> 01:01:45,796
<i>Yeah. And you know how they
are about their fuels.</i>

1042
01:01:45,798 --> 01:01:47,531
<i>So we are in trouble...
Grumman...</i>

1043
01:01:49,302 --> 01:01:50,668
What does this mean?

1044
01:01:52,738 --> 01:01:57,008
So the mole knew that we
couldn't make it to the moon

1045
01:01:57,010 --> 01:02:00,344
for over a year?

1046
01:02:00,346 --> 01:02:02,647
I don't think so.

1047
01:02:02,649 --> 01:02:04,715
I don't think
that Lhotsky's the mole,

1048
01:02:04,717 --> 01:02:08,419
I don't think Lhotsky
was outside the studio.

1049
01:02:08,421 --> 01:02:10,621
I mean, Lhotsky knows that we
can't make it to the moon,

1050
01:02:10,623 --> 01:02:12,023
so maybe they...
He wouldn't cooperate

1051
01:02:12,025 --> 01:02:14,325
and they had to
make him a fall guy

1052
01:02:14,327 --> 01:02:15,426
by saying that he's the mole.

1053
01:02:15,428 --> 01:02:16,494
They?

1054
01:02:17,663 --> 01:02:18,929
Yeah.

1055
01:02:18,931 --> 01:02:21,866
What do you mean? The CIA.

1056
01:02:21,868 --> 01:02:25,736
Okay, well then, who's outside
the studio following us?

1057
01:02:25,738 --> 01:02:27,672
CIA agents.

1058
01:02:27,674 --> 01:02:30,641
That's why boles
didn't shoot them.

1059
01:02:30,643 --> 01:02:32,310
They're all working together.

1060
01:02:32,312 --> 01:02:34,779
They're all watching us,
and they're lying to us.

1061
01:02:34,781 --> 01:02:36,347
For what?
For what purpose?

1062
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:37,615
They know everything
that we're doing.

1063
01:02:37,617 --> 01:02:39,884
Why... This doesn't
make any sense.

1064
01:02:39,886 --> 01:02:42,820
There's no reason
for them to be following us.

1065
01:02:42,822 --> 01:02:44,555
You... have you...

1066
01:02:44,557 --> 01:02:47,525
Have you heard of a
conspiracy theory before?

1067
01:02:47,527 --> 01:02:49,527
Yeah.

1068
01:02:49,529 --> 01:02:51,395
I think we're in one.

1069
01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:54,058
Okay, leg out!

1070
01:03:55,428 --> 01:03:56,660
That doesn't look real.

1071
01:03:56,662 --> 01:03:58,028
Okay, you know what we'll do?

1072
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:00,731
Jump on the count of three.
Ready?

1073
01:04:00,733 --> 01:04:01,966
I'm bringing the bounce in.

1074
01:04:01,968 --> 01:04:03,834
That's a big jump.

1075
01:04:03,836 --> 01:04:05,436
Come on, you're supposed
to be Neil Armstrong.

1076
01:04:05,438 --> 01:04:06,570
He's brave. Ready?

1077
01:04:06,572 --> 01:04:08,506
There we go.

1078
01:04:11,176 --> 01:04:13,511
Uh, change the background.

1079
01:04:17,082 --> 01:04:18,849
One more.

1080
01:04:20,919 --> 01:04:21,986
How about that?

1081
01:04:21,988 --> 01:04:23,888
Great.

1082
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:25,990
That's great.

1083
01:04:25,992 --> 01:04:27,792
What are we getting in the
reflection of his helmet?

1084
01:04:27,794 --> 01:04:29,160
Am I in it?

1085
01:04:29,162 --> 01:04:30,628
We'll have
to replace that after.

1086
01:04:42,707 --> 01:04:44,708
That looks great.
And then you just...

1087
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:46,477
We have to repress this.

1088
01:04:46,479 --> 01:04:47,845
Put that on an animation
stand and reshoot it.

1089
01:04:47,847 --> 01:04:50,514
This is the original
from the sound stage.

1090
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:52,550
And the crater textures
are added after.

1091
01:04:52,552 --> 01:04:54,852
Getting rid of the
details in the studio.

1092
01:04:54,854 --> 01:04:57,588
You go in and you black out
the areas with litho ink.

1093
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:00,191
Let's move this
a little bit further down,

1094
01:05:00,193 --> 01:05:02,893
because it seems
a little too square.

1095
01:05:02,895 --> 01:05:04,495
Square to camera?
Yeah.

1096
01:05:04,497 --> 01:05:05,563
Sure.

1097
01:05:10,735 --> 01:05:12,169
Wow.

1098
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:28,152
Ready?
That's good. Yeah, go.

1099
01:05:28,154 --> 01:05:30,621
It works.

1100
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,922
Yes!

1101
01:05:34,092 --> 01:05:35,192
This is amazing!
Go again.

1102
01:05:35,194 --> 01:05:37,828
Matt.
Yes?

1103
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:39,230
Have you seen this?
Have you seen this?

1104
01:05:39,232 --> 01:05:42,500
Do it again! Do it again!
Owen, look, look.

1105
01:05:42,502 --> 01:05:44,268
Hammer, feather.

1106
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:46,537
Drop!
Galileo was right.

1107
01:05:46,539 --> 01:05:49,874
Dude, I just put
a weight in it. What?

1108
01:05:49,876 --> 01:05:52,643
"NASA scientist dies."

1109
01:05:52,645 --> 01:05:54,144
It's from this morning's paper.

1110
01:05:56,548 --> 01:05:59,550
Well, what the...
Matt, it's Lhotsky.

1111
01:05:59,552 --> 01:06:00,784
What?

1112
01:06:00,786 --> 01:06:02,953
Boles, he must've
known about it.

1113
01:06:04,189 --> 01:06:05,990
Listen, think
why Lhotsky's dead.

1114
01:06:05,992 --> 01:06:07,858
Obviously, he was talking to
Webb, so they killed him.

1115
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:09,860
They're going to kill me...

1116
01:06:09,862 --> 01:06:11,896
We don't know why that guy's dead.
Yes, we do.

1117
01:06:11,898 --> 01:06:14,031
They're going to kill me?
What are you talking about?

1118
01:06:14,033 --> 01:06:15,699
They're going to kill us both, they're
going to kill the astronauts.

1119
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:17,935
I'm sure... Anyone who
knows about this.

1120
01:06:17,937 --> 01:06:20,304
I'm sure Lhotsky knew too much and so
they got rid of him. Okay? That's it.

1121
01:06:20,306 --> 01:06:22,940
Right! Right! That's
what I'm talking about!

1122
01:06:22,942 --> 01:06:25,576
He was the mole, okay?

1123
01:06:25,578 --> 01:06:28,612
No... no, they're tying
off loose ends!

1124
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:30,614
Yeah, and, so, who else
is gonna die, huh?

1125
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:33,551
They're gonna kill Jim Webb? The
head of NASA? He knows, too!

1126
01:06:33,553 --> 01:06:35,819
Maybe. Maybe. You don't
think they would?

1127
01:06:35,821 --> 01:06:39,790
No! Okay, put the suit on and get
ready, all right? Shut the fuck up.

1128
01:06:54,974 --> 01:06:59,577
There's a glob of something on the...
on the glass. Owen, could you get it?

1129
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:02,646
No, it's right... You didn't get it.
It's right there.

1130
01:07:02,648 --> 01:07:05,249
Right, right there.

1131
01:07:05,251 --> 01:07:07,918
What... What are you doing?
It's just a test.

1132
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,954
Boles, I don't take
orders from you!

1133
01:07:09,956 --> 01:07:12,122
- Oh, really?
- Enough, come on.

1134
01:07:12,124 --> 01:07:14,758
Yeah, I don't take orders from someone
who's trying to get us killed.

1135
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,627
Owen, Owen, Owen. Drop it.

1136
01:07:16,629 --> 01:07:17,861
He let them get away.
No, he didn't...

1137
01:07:17,863 --> 01:07:19,363
Right?
He let them get away!

1138
01:07:19,365 --> 01:07:21,165
That's what you did.
Oh, really?

1139
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:23,200
- Yes, you missed on purpose!
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1140
01:07:23,202 --> 01:07:25,769
What... what are you doing? What
are you doing? We're friends.

1141
01:07:25,771 --> 01:07:27,304
Who are they?
We're friends.

1142
01:07:27,306 --> 01:07:30,341
Who are they?
Is it Brackett? The CIA?

1143
01:07:30,343 --> 01:07:32,810
Why don't you tell him about how you've
been calling Brackett every day,

1144
01:07:32,812 --> 01:07:36,647
trying to get Johnson thrown off
the mission. Tell him that!

1145
01:07:36,649 --> 01:07:38,916
What are you talking about?
Hey, ask your friend.

1146
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,623
Okay, hold on.

1147
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:48,192
Tell him. Tell him.

1148
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:08,812
<i>We choose to go to the moon.</i>

1149
01:08:08,814 --> 01:08:10,781
<i>We choose to go to the moon.</i>

1150
01:08:17,188 --> 01:08:19,757
<i>We choose to go to the moon
in this decade</i>

1151
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,759
<i>and do the other things.</i>

1152
01:08:21,761 --> 01:08:25,262
<i>Not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.</i>

1153
01:08:25,264 --> 01:08:29,333
<i>Because that goal will serve
to organize and measure</i>

1154
01:08:29,335 --> 01:08:33,037
<i>the best
of our energies and skills.</i>

1155
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:36,840
<i>Because that challenge is one
that we're willing to accept.</i>

1156
01:08:36,842 --> 01:08:42,713
<i>One we are unwilling to postpone, and one
we intend to win, and the others, too.</i>

1157
01:08:49,921 --> 01:08:52,089
<i>We shall send to the moon,</i>

1158
01:08:52,091 --> 01:08:57,861
<i>240,000 miles away from the
control station in Houston,</i>

1159
01:08:57,863 --> 01:09:00,030
<i>a giant rocket,</i>

1160
01:09:00,032 --> 01:09:04,702
<i>more than 300 feet tall, the
length of this football field,</i>

1161
01:09:04,704 --> 01:09:09,473
<i>made of new metal alloys, some of
which have not yet been invented,</i>

1162
01:09:09,475 --> 01:09:12,443
<i>capable of standing
heat and stresses</i>

1163
01:09:12,445 --> 01:09:16,046
<i>several times more than
have ever been experienced,</i>

1164
01:09:16,048 --> 01:09:18,415
<i>on an untried mission</i>

1165
01:09:18,417 --> 01:09:20,918
<i>to an unknown celestial body,</i>

1166
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,221
<i>and then return it
safely to earth,</i>

1167
01:09:24,223 --> 01:09:29,093
<i>re-entering the atmosphere at speeds
of over 25,000 miles per hour,</i>

1168
01:09:29,095 --> 01:09:33,230
<i>and do all this... And do
all this and do it right,</i>

1169
01:09:33,232 --> 01:09:36,500
<i>and do it first,
before this decade is out,</i>

1170
01:09:36,502 --> 01:09:38,435
<i>then we must be bold.</i>

1171
01:09:41,474 --> 01:09:43,974
<i>And therefore, as we set sail,</i>

1172
01:09:43,976 --> 01:09:48,479
<i>we ask god's blessing on the
most hazardous and dangerous</i>

1173
01:09:48,481 --> 01:09:51,982
<i>and greatest adventure on
which man has ever embarked.</i>

1174
01:09:51,984 --> 01:09:53,317
<i>Thank you.</i>

1175
01:10:14,806 --> 01:10:16,774
So this is the only copy?

1176
01:10:16,776 --> 01:10:21,078
Yeah. So, now what? We
just bring it to Brackett?

1177
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,981
Oh, I'll take it to Brackett.
You stay here and clean up.

1178
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:26,483
Clean up what?

1179
01:10:26,485 --> 01:10:29,419
Clean up the studio.
Destroy everything.

1180
01:10:31,556 --> 01:10:33,223
What if we... What if
we need that stuff?

1181
01:10:33,225 --> 01:10:36,393
We won't.
Good work.

1182
01:10:36,395 --> 01:10:39,396
Thanks.
I'll see you soon.

1183
01:10:39,398 --> 01:10:43,801
- Hey, boles.
- Lhotsky wasn't the mole, was he?

1184
01:10:50,275 --> 01:10:52,476
What are you talking about?

1185
01:10:55,413 --> 01:10:58,048
Yeah, I don't...

1186
01:10:58,050 --> 01:10:59,583
I don't know.

1187
01:10:59,585 --> 01:11:02,419
I've been working on this too long.
I'm sorry.

1188
01:11:02,421 --> 01:11:04,488
Well, get some rest.

1189
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:06,190
I'll see you soon.

1190
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:08,192
Bye, buddy.

1191
01:12:14,994 --> 01:12:19,563
<i>He's gonna spot one of our guys pretending
to be a rocket scientist instantly.</i>

1192
01:12:19,565 --> 01:12:24,134
<i>We need to send people who are gonna look
like they have no idea what's going on.</i>

1193
01:12:35,514 --> 01:12:37,514
<i>They can't make it to the moon.</i>

1194
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:41,385
<i>I'm gonna tell you
what they said.</i>

1195
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,093
<i>An ethical problem
with this at all?</i>

1196
01:13:00,272 --> 01:13:02,239
<i>He let them get away! That's what you did.
Oh, really?</i>

1197
01:13:02,241 --> 01:13:04,174
<i>Yes, you missed on purpose!</i>

1198
01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:06,109
<i>Hey whoa, whoa, whoa!
What... what are you doing?</i>

1199
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:07,644
<i>What are you doing?
We're friends!</i>

1200
01:13:07,646 --> 01:13:09,680
<i>- Who are they?
- We're friends.</i>

1201
01:13:12,717 --> 01:13:15,118
<i>What, you think that's your friend?
Who, Brackett?</i>

1202
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,254
<i>The CIA? Why don't you
tell him about how...</i>

1203
01:14:03,602 --> 01:14:06,770
Hey, Julie.
Can I borrow your husband?

1204
01:14:09,273 --> 01:14:13,710
He what?
Simon's asleep. Inside.

1205
01:14:13,712 --> 01:14:15,712
I can go inside
so you guys can talk.

1206
01:14:15,714 --> 01:14:17,547
You can stay outside.

1207
01:14:17,549 --> 01:14:21,084
No, I don't need to talk.
I wanna know if, um...

1208
01:14:21,086 --> 01:14:25,355
If you wanna... we're... We're going
to get rid of the stuff from work.

1209
01:14:27,658 --> 01:14:30,360
You can go if you want.

1210
01:14:30,362 --> 01:14:32,329
No, I'm going to stay here.

1211
01:14:36,067 --> 01:14:38,769
How's Simon? Are you guys
excited about the big launch?

1212
01:14:42,573 --> 01:14:46,276
Okay.
Have a good afternoon.

1213
01:14:46,278 --> 01:14:48,178
Thanks. You, too.
I'll see you soon, okay?

1214
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:49,413
Yeah, bye.

1215
01:15:02,326 --> 01:15:04,561
<i>Good morning.</i>

1216
01:15:04,563 --> 01:15:08,832
<i>It's t-minus one hour, 29 minutes
and 53 seconds and counting.</i>

1217
01:15:08,834 --> 01:15:13,136
<i>In just an hour and a half, if all
goes well, Apollo eleven astronauts,</i>

1218
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:15,338
<i>Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins</i>

1219
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:18,675
<i>are to lift off
from pad 39-a out there</i>

1220
01:15:18,677 --> 01:15:22,112
<i>on the voyage man always
has dreamed about.</i>

1221
01:15:22,114 --> 01:15:24,815
<i>Next stop for them, the moon.</i>

1222
01:15:24,817 --> 01:15:27,451
<i>And we are all about
to witness the fulfillment</i>

1223
01:15:27,453 --> 01:15:30,253
<i>of that promise
that president Kennedy made</i>

1224
01:15:30,255 --> 01:15:36,159
<i>at rice university stadium in
Texas, on September 12, 1962.</i>

1225
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:38,361
<i>We passed 10,000 odd cars</i>

1226
01:15:38,363 --> 01:15:41,131
<i>parked around the gate-1 area at 4:00 A.M.
when we got here.</i>

1227
01:15:41,133 --> 01:15:44,534
<i>Cars from every state, with
little kids staring wide-eyed,</i>

1228
01:15:44,536 --> 01:15:47,804
<i>and we saw
teenagers with telescopes.</i>

1229
01:15:47,806 --> 01:15:50,540
<i>It was a very moving scene
for me, because</i>

1230
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:53,743
<i>Americans cared then,
I think, and they care now.</i>

1231
01:15:53,745 --> 01:15:57,681
<i>And it says, "good luck,</i> Apollo
11" <i>engraved in the sand.</i>

1232
01:15:57,683 --> 01:16:01,785
<i>All going very smoothly
here with the count.</i>

1233
01:16:01,787 --> 01:16:03,854
<i>T-minus 60 seconds
and counting.</i>

1234
01:16:03,856 --> 01:16:07,457
<i>We've passed t-minus 60.
Power transfer is complete.</i>

1235
01:16:11,529 --> 01:16:14,631
<i>Twelve, eleven, ten, nine...</i>

1236
01:16:14,633 --> 01:16:17,334
<i>Ignition sequence starts.</i>

1237
01:16:17,336 --> 01:16:22,873
<i>Six, five, four,
three, two, one.</i>

1238
01:16:50,701 --> 01:16:54,204
<i>And good afternoon from ABC
space headquarters in New York.</i>

1239
01:16:54,206 --> 01:16:57,674
<i>With me is our science editor, Jules
Bergman and we are on the air today</i>

1240
01:16:57,676 --> 01:17:01,611
<i>to bring you a complete report on
some very, very important maneuvers</i>

1241
01:17:01,613 --> 01:17:03,713
<i>to be performed by</i> Apollo 11.

1242
01:17:03,715 --> 01:17:05,282
<i>Basically a position
to begin the process...</i>

1243
01:17:05,284 --> 01:17:06,383
Hello?

1244
01:17:06,385 --> 01:17:08,251
<i>Matt?</i>

1245
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:10,220
Are you... Are you
seeing this right now?

1246
01:17:10,222 --> 01:17:12,622
<i>- Matt, they're not dead.
- The CIA lied to us.</i>

1247
01:17:12,624 --> 01:17:14,858
Wait, what?

1248
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:17,494
<i>The men following us at the
studio are outside my house.</i>

1249
01:17:17,496 --> 01:17:19,863
Are you sure? <i>Yes,
meet me at your motel.</i>

1250
01:17:27,638 --> 01:17:29,773
What the hell?

1251
01:17:32,744 --> 01:17:34,811
Owen?

1252
01:17:38,216 --> 01:17:39,983
Hello?

1253
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:55,432
Who's there?

1254
01:17:55,434 --> 01:17:56,733
Oh, shit.

1255
01:17:58,502 --> 01:18:00,804
Okay, okay, okay.

1256
01:18:03,575 --> 01:18:06,610
Uh... uh...

1257
01:18:08,679 --> 01:18:10,647
Where's the other car?
Where's the...

1258
01:18:10,649 --> 01:18:12,749
Um, um, out back.
Out back.

1259
01:18:22,561 --> 01:18:24,661
Okay, stand back.

1260
01:18:47,552 --> 01:18:49,586
Sorry.

1261
01:18:49,588 --> 01:18:51,521
<i>There is a delirium
of enthusiasm today...</i>

1262
01:18:56,594 --> 01:18:58,361
Come on.

1263
01:18:58,363 --> 01:19:00,397
Come on, come on.

1264
01:19:07,972 --> 01:19:10,340
Come on, Owen.
Come on!

1265
01:19:19,717 --> 01:19:22,519
Matt!

1266
01:19:22,521 --> 01:19:24,054
What?

1267
01:19:24,056 --> 01:19:25,822
There's a car!

1268
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:37,667
Jared, run!

1269
01:19:44,542 --> 01:19:47,677
Shit.
Go, go, go.

1270
01:19:57,388 --> 01:19:59,389
Andy, hold on.

1271
01:20:06,797 --> 01:20:08,365
Fuck.

1272
01:20:15,606 --> 01:20:17,640
They're right behind us.
They're right behind us.

1273
01:20:23,814 --> 01:20:25,982
Get their faces! Get their faces, Andy!
Get their faces!

1274
01:20:25,984 --> 01:20:27,851
This is fucking crazy!

1275
01:20:33,924 --> 01:20:36,693
Oh, god!
Oh, Christ!

1276
01:20:41,532 --> 01:20:43,433
He's got a gun!
What?

1277
01:20:43,435 --> 01:20:45,902
- He's got a fucking gun.
- Okay, duck, duck, duck!

1278
01:20:53,078 --> 01:20:54,611
Shit.

1279
01:21:08,527 --> 01:21:09,959
What's happening?

1280
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:14,431
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

1281
01:21:23,108 --> 01:21:24,674
Okay, okay.

1282
01:21:31,549 --> 01:21:33,616
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

1283
01:21:33,618 --> 01:21:34,818
I'm trying.
Get out of here.

1284
01:21:36,954 --> 01:21:38,455
Dude, they're
right in front of us.

1285
01:21:38,457 --> 01:21:39,722
Yeah, I know.

1286
01:21:45,797 --> 01:21:47,477
They're gonna ram us,
they're gonna ram us!

1287
01:21:54,572 --> 01:21:56,239
Oh!

1288
01:22:20,731 --> 01:22:22,565
Owen!

1289
01:22:22,567 --> 01:22:24,601
Owen!

1290
01:22:24,603 --> 01:22:26,135
Owen!

1291
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:30,173
Owen!

1292
01:22:42,186 --> 01:22:43,520
Owen!

1293
01:24:58,789 --> 01:25:00,957
So they're not
all labeled, right?

1294
01:25:00,959 --> 01:25:05,361
It goes '67, '68, '69. But not
everything's... Not everything's marked.

1295
01:25:05,363 --> 01:25:07,830
Well, you'll figure it out.

1296
01:25:07,832 --> 01:25:09,332
Hey.

1297
01:25:16,907 --> 01:25:19,008
Okay, man.

1298
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:21,044
As soon as I know where
we're going, I'll call you.

1299
01:25:21,046 --> 01:25:22,245
Yeah.

1300
01:26:47,831 --> 01:26:49,832
<i>Good evening.</i>

1301
01:26:49,834 --> 01:26:52,168
Hello, there's a man at the end
of the bar wearing glasses.

1302
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:54,437
Could you please give
the phone to him?

1303
01:26:58,776 --> 01:27:00,810
Telephone.

1304
01:27:05,783 --> 01:27:07,483
<i>Hello?</i>

1305
01:27:07,485 --> 01:27:09,919
You're a real piece of
shit, you know that?

1306
01:27:13,957 --> 01:27:16,125
<i>We're looking for you.
Where you been?</i>

1307
01:27:16,127 --> 01:27:18,060
Yeah, I'll tell you what,
let's make a trade.

1308
01:27:19,797 --> 01:27:21,364
<i>Okay.</i>

1309
01:27:21,366 --> 01:27:24,133
My location for the names of
the agents on your kill team.

1310
01:27:26,203 --> 01:27:28,070
<i>We don't have any kill team.</i>

1311
01:27:28,072 --> 01:27:31,307
Yeah, well, who killed Owen
and hung him in his garage?

1312
01:27:34,344 --> 01:27:38,381
<i>Okay. Come down to the office.
We'll discuss it.</i>

1313
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:40,283
Yeah, I'll come in.

1314
01:27:40,285 --> 01:27:41,884
No, I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.

1315
01:27:41,886 --> 01:27:44,120
I have a film
of everything we did.

1316
01:27:44,122 --> 01:27:47,390
I have proof that the CIA conspired
to fake the moon landing

1317
01:27:47,392 --> 01:27:50,860
and that Owen Williams is the one that
everybody is about to see walk on the moon.

1318
01:27:50,862 --> 01:27:53,896
And that you killed him
to keep it a secret.

1319
01:27:53,898 --> 01:27:55,865
I even got you
planning Northwoods,

1320
01:27:55,867 --> 01:27:58,000
the same as I got you right now.

1321
01:28:06,009 --> 01:28:08,077
<i>No one will take
that seriously, kid.</i>

1322
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:10,146
Yeah, well, call my bluff.

1323
01:28:10,148 --> 01:28:13,449
My last movie's about to convince
the world we went to the moon.

1324
01:28:13,451 --> 01:28:16,886
<i>Then why don't
I make you a deal?</i>

1325
01:28:16,888 --> 01:28:18,521
<i>Come back and work for us,</i>

1326
01:28:18,523 --> 01:28:22,525
<i>and I'll make you the head
of your own department.</i>

1327
01:28:25,096 --> 01:28:29,532
Yeah, how stupid
do you think I am?

1328
01:28:32,904 --> 01:28:35,304
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

1329
01:28:35,306 --> 01:28:39,609
<i>Keep the film as collateral if you
don't believe me. Just think about it.</i>

1330
01:29:24,988 --> 01:29:29,058
<i>The surface appears to be, uh,</i>

1331
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:32,929
<i>very, very fine grained as
you get close to it.</i>

1332
01:29:32,931 --> 01:29:35,131
<i>It's almost like a powder.</i>

1333
01:29:35,133 --> 01:29:38,334
<i>Down there, uh, is very fine.</i>

1334
01:29:40,137 --> 01:29:42,705
<i>Okay, I'm going to
step off the LM now.</i>

1335
01:29:48,412 --> 01:29:51,614
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

1336
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:57,253
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

1337
01:30:08,966 --> 01:30:14,036
<i>And the, uh, the surface
is fine and powdery.</i>

1338
01:30:14,038 --> 01:30:18,474
<i>I can... I can pick
it up loosely with my toe.</i>

1339
01:30:18,476 --> 01:30:21,444
<i>It does adhere in fine...</i>

1340
01:32:58,136 --> 01:33:00,169
<i>Okay, we shouldn't take</i>

1341
01:33:00,171 --> 01:33:02,872
<i>any more pictures on this roll
until earth comes, I don't think.</i>

1342
01:33:02,874 --> 01:33:06,242
<i>This is about out, it's just about
out until our last color roll,</i>

1343
01:33:06,244 --> 01:33:08,744
<i>so, uh, we'll switch to black and
white as soon as we get to earth.</i>

1344
01:33:08,746 --> 01:33:11,180
<i>- We might make it in time.
- Yeah.</i>

1345
01:33:14,718 --> 01:33:17,219
<i>There it is, it's coming up.
What?</i>

1346
01:33:17,221 --> 01:33:18,754
<i>The earth.
You see it?</i>

1347
01:33:18,756 --> 01:33:20,389
<i>Yeah.</i>

1348
01:33:20,391 --> 01:33:24,660
<i>Beautiful.
It's half-way up.</i>
